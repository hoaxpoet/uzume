//
// Video capture works by blitting the drawable texture, *inside* the render
// command buffer, into a Metal texture that aliases an IOSurface-backed
// CVPixelBuffer (`makeVideoFrame`), then handing that same buffer to the
// AVAssetWriter from the completion handler on a dedicated serial queue. One
// buffer per frame: no shared texture a later frame can overwrite, no CPU copy.
