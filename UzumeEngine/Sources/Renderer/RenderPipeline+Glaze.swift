// RenderPipeline+Glaze — the Glaze mv_warp draw branch (GLAZE.2a).
//
// Port of the butterchurn builtin `Flexi + stahlregen - jelly showoff parade` (cream-of-
// crop legends; the glossy "wet jelly" contour-gel). Dedicated branch mirroring Nacre /
// Fata Morgana. Per frame — the Nacre structure (no blur target in 2a; the source's
// 3-level blur pyramid + its emboss/sheen consumer land together in GLAZE.2b):
//
//   warp(prev, u) → composeTexture   (custom feedback warp; bakes its own decay + seed)
//   comp(compose, u) → target        (the display look; DISPLAY-only, never fed back)
//   swap warpTexture ↔ composeTexture
//
// GLAZE.2a (THIS) wires the branch with STUB shaders (see Glaze.metal) — proves the live
// dispatch + test harness end to end. GLAZE.2b fills the faithful spring-physics warp
// center + blur-pyramid gel sheen; the greenlit uplifts (A/B/C) are GLAZE.5+ (FA #65).
