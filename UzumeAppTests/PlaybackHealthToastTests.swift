// PlaybackHealthToastTests — ASH.2 one-per-session band=low nudge.
//
// Dead-tap is deliberately NOT toasted here — the AudioStallOverlayView card
// covers it earlier and more prominently (Matt's call, ASH.2). This suite locks
// down only the low-level toast: it fires once, never repeats, ignores healthy
// bands, and picks the Spotify vs generic remediation copy.
//
// D-197 "degraded only after loud": the nudge fires only after the chain has been
// observed `band=healthy` (loud) at least once — a quiet intro that starts low no
// longer false-flags. So every toast-expecting test here first sends a healthy
// window, then degrades. (Before-loud suppression itself is covered by
// PlaybackErrorBridgeTests.test_lowBeforeHealthy_doesNotNudge.)
