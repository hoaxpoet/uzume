// NimbusState — Per-preset world state for the Nimbus volumetric preset.
//
// Nimbus is a `direct` preset whose GPU side is stateless frame-to-frame (the
// body is recomputed every frame). Everything temporal lives here, CPU-side,
// flushed each frame to the buffer the shader reads at fragment buffer(6).
//
// NB.4 (Energy) shipped a single broadband-energy "bloom" follower. The
// 2026-06-05 Atlas (Battles) session showed that model was too subtle and, on
// bass-dominated music, structurally broken: the bloom averaged three bands
// `(bass+mid+treble)`, and with mid/treble near-silent the two dead bands
// vetoed it — the body sat near floor-size all session while the relentless
// 136-BPM beat went unanswered. Matt's call: wrong model — drive from the beat,
// per stem. (Reverses the original "nothing on the beat" premise; see
// NIMBUS_DESIGN §1.3 and DECISIONS.)
//
// NB.5 — the band plays the body. One coherent gaseous mass that HEAVES with
// the full band: each stem pushes a soft, blended bulge of the *single*
// envelope (a star-convex deformation — it cannot fragment into separate
// blobs), driven by a fast-attack/slow-release follower so it puffs on the hit
// and settles. Layers (one audio primitive per layer — FA #67):
//
//   • bloom      — slow overall size/brightness swell ← mean of the four stem
//                  ENERGIES (robust; never floored by a dead band). FV bass
//                  proxy during the ~10 s stem warmup (D-019 blend).
//   • kickPunch  — whole-body inflate + brightness pop ← whichever is larger
//                  (NB.8) of the anticipatory cached-grid ramp over the last
//                  ~18 % of each beat, peaking ON the beat, and the zero-delay
//                  onset pulse `max(beatBass, beatComposite)` — the fallback
//                  when the grid isn't locked. No stem term: both inputs are
//                  live from frame 1, so the kick needs no warmup gate. The
//                  hero beat moment; the kick is the spine of the beat.
//   • bassLobe   — heaves the body DOWN  ← bass-stem energy deviation (D-026).
//   • vocalsLobe — flares the body UP    ← lead/"vocals"-stem deviation.
//   • otherLobe  — swells the body SIDE  ← other-stem deviation.
//   • flowPhase  — gas churn phase, advancing faster with bloom + on kicks.
//
// The three directional lobes are stem-only (no FV proxy) so they sit at zero
// until the live stem analyzer converges, then ramp in naturally.
//
// The state buffer is bound at fragment buffer(6) via
// `RenderPipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` (orthogonal to noiseVolume at
// *texture* 6). @unchecked Sendable + NSLock for audio-thread safety;
// .storageModeShared MTLBuffer for UMA; per-frame tick(...) flush.
