// swiftlint:disable file_length
// SessionPreparer — Batch pre-analysis pipeline for playlist session preparation.
// Orchestrates: preview resolution → download → stem separation → MIR analysis
// → StemCache storage for every track before playback begins.
//
// Tracks whose previews are unavailable receive no cache entry; the real-time
// pipeline fills them during playback via the existing 5-second cadence.
//
// Pre-flight audit notes (U.4):
// - .analyzing(.mir) is NOT emitted as a separate transition. MIR runs inside the
//   nonisolated Task.detached block alongside stem separation; emitting mid-task
//   would require restructuring analyzePreview. TODO(U.4-followup): split detached block.
// - Download progress uses the -1 sentinel (indeterminate). URLSession progress
//   callback not wired. TODO(U.4-followup): wire URLSession download progress.
//
// LF.5 (D-132, 2026-05-27): adds `prepareLocalFiles(urls:placeholders:via:)` —
// the multi-file local-file twin of `prepare(tracks:)`. Walks an URL queue
// via a `LocalFilePreparing` delegate and publishes the same `trackStatuses`
// + `progress` SignalView the streaming path uses. The file_length disable
// above is the tracked acknowledgement that both pipelines own the same
// in-memory state machine; splitting requires widening property access
// across the engine module which leaks worse than the file_length warning.
