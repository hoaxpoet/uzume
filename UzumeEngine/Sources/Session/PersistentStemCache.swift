// PersistentStemCache — Disk-backed content-keyed cache for local-file
// pre-analysis results (LF.3 / D-130; LF.4 / D-131 eviction + clear;
// LF.5 / D-132 schema v2 with ID3 / Vorbis metadata).
//
// Sibling to `StemCache` (in-memory only). The persistent layer keys on
// the SHA-256 of the source audio file's bytes, not on `TrackIdentity`
// — so renamed/moved files still hit cache, and so the on-disk format
// stays decoupled from `TrackIdentity`'s evolving schema.
//
// LF.4: an LRU eviction policy keeps the cache from growing unbounded.
// Default cap is 500 MB (~70 tracks at ~7 MB/track). Eviction fires
// after every successful `store(...)` call so the cap is continuously
// enforced. `clearAll()` is the user-facing reset hook surfaced via the
// `Uzume → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)` menu item.
//
// LF.5: `metadata.json` schema bumps to version 2 with an optional
// `metadata: LocalFileMetadata` field carrying ID3 / Vorbis-extracted
// title / artist / album. Optional `artwork.bin` sibling holds raw image
// bytes (PNG / JPEG — whatever the container embedded). Schema-v1 entries
// on disk throw `schemaMismatch` and the caller re-prepares.
//
// Layout on disk:
//
//     <rootDirectory>/
//       sha256/
//         <aa>/                      (first 2 hex chars of the hash)
//           <full-hash>/
//             metadata.json          (schemaVersion + BeatGrid + StemFeatures + TrackProfile + LocalFileMetadata + …)
//             vocals.f32             (raw little-endian Float32 PCM)
//             drums.f32
//             bass.f32
//             other.f32
//             artwork.bin            (LF.5; optional — only present when the source ships embedded art)
//
// Failure model: all cache failures (missing files, schema mismatch,
// corrupt JSON, partial write) surface as `PersistentStemCacheError`.
// Callers should log and fall through to the in-memory / re-analyze
// path — the cache is an optimization, never a correctness requirement.
