// SpectralAnalyzer+Result — the per-frame output type and what each field is FOR.
//
// Split out at FTR.24 for the reason `SpectralAnalyzer+Density.swift` was: the parent file
// sits against the 400-line budget, and the field documentation is the part that grows. It
// grows because these fields are the audio contract every preset routes against, and each
// one that was added without its measured rationale has cost a review round — the DYN.1
// density comment and the FTR.24 level-rise comment both exist to stop a future increment
// re-deriving a number that has already been paid for. Calibration history:
// `docs/ENGINE/DYN1_CALIBRATION.md`.
