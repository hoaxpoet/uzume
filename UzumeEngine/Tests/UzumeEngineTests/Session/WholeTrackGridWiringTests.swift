// PR.12 — the local path must ask for a whole-track grid; streaming must not.
//
// `BeatThisModel.tMax` clamps inference to 1500 frames (30 s at 50 fps). For a streaming
// preview that costs nothing — the preview IS 30 s. For a local file it truncated the grid
// to 6.7–26 % of the track, and past the end of `BeatGrid.beats` `localTiming` falls back
// to `60.0 / bpm`, a whole-track AVERAGE. ~90 % of every local track therefore ran on one
// averaged tempo, which against changing music is a linear phase error — BUG-065's drift.
//
// This gates the WIRING, which is the part a refactor silently breaks: the flag has to
// reach the analyzer, and only from the local path.
