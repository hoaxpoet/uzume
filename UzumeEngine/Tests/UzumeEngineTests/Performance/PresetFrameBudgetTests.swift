// PresetFrameBudgetTests — per-preset GPU cost, measured through each preset's REAL path.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `CLAUDE.md` promises 60 fps at 1080p. Until 2026-08-19 nothing checked it:
// the only performance test in the suite rendered a SINGLE frame with no per-preset budget,
// across 29 shipping presets. Witchlight was found running at 273.88 ms/frame at 4K — 11.2 fps,
// 16x over budget, 84x the cheapest preset in the same session — and it was found by accident,
// because Matt happened to leave it on screen long enough to attribute frames to it. Nothing
// would have caught a second one (BUG-098, and Matt's question that produced it).
//
// WHAT THIS IS, AND IS NOT. It is a REGRESSION detector, not a production-fidelity budget:
//
//   - the harness reads every frame back to the CPU, which production never does, so the
//     absolute numbers here are NOT production frame times. Measured on Witchlight, this
//     harness reads ~0.56x of the live GPU time at the same resolution.
//   - it therefore asserts against a RECORDED PER-PRESET BASELINE, and fails a preset that
//     gets materially slower than its own last-known cost. That catches "someone added an
//     unguarded warped_fbm" — the actual BUG-098 failure — without pretending the harness
//     reproduces production timing.
//   - `absoluteCeilingMs` is a second, deliberately loose net for a preset arriving already
//     broken, where no baseline exists to regress from.
//
// ⚠ COVERAGE IS PARTIAL AND IS PRINTED EVERY RUN. `MultiPassRenderHarness` reaches 15 presets
// through their real multi-pass path. The rest are not silently skipped — `uncoveredPresets`
// names them and the run prints them, because a gate that quietly measures half the roster
// reads as "all green" when it is not. That silence is what let BUG-098 live.
