// ReplayHarnessRouteCoverageTests — the replay harness must CARRY every route it replays.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `SessionReplayHarness` builds its `FeatureVector` / `StemFeatures`
// from a hand-written CSV→field mapping. Any field it does not map is silently ZERO, so
// a preset route driven by that field renders as if it were dead — and the resulting
// measurement "proves" the route is broken while actually testing nothing. There is no
// error, no warning, and the render looks plausible.
//
// This failed three separate ways in one session before being mechanized:
//
//   1. Faraday's beat-locked subharmonic measured r = -0.019 (apparently no lock at
//      all). The harness never mapped `barPhase01`. Once mapped, the SAME shader code
//      measured r = +0.868.
//   2. The fix for (1) mapped the CSV column as `pulseAmp01`, but the session logs
//      snake_case `pulse_amp01` — so the repair itself still read zero. A typo in a
//      string literal is indistinguishable from a dead route.
//   3. `stemFeatures: .zero` was passed for EVERY frame, so all stem-driven routes in
//      all ray-march presets replayed against silence — including Volumetric
//      Lithograph, which is CERTIFIED on per-stem coupling.
//
// RE-VALIDATION (2026-07-27, after the fix). Rendering each replayable preset twice —
// real stems vs the old silence — quantifies what the broken instrument was hiding:
//
//   Volumetric Lithograph   image differs by 11.86/255 (its own frame-to-frame motion is
//                           4.93) — the stem coupling is LIVE and DOMINANT, and every
//                           past replay judgement was made on an image missing it.
//   Ferrofluid Ocean        17.88/255 — LIVE.
//   Lumen Mosaic            stem sensitivity 0 at FULL resolution (max pixel delta 0),
//                           though it does animate on its own (max 10/255 across ~9 % of
//                           pixels) from a non-stem driver.
//
// ⚠ CORRECTION: an earlier pass reported Lumen as "0.00 — dead static". That was a
// MEASUREMENT ARTIFACT, not a finding — the comparison downscaled to 160x90 and took a
// median, averaging a real max-10/255 change over ~9 % of pixels down to zero. The
// instrument built to catch silent zeros produced one of its own. Compare at full
// resolution, and always report max / percent-changed alongside any mean.
//
// The FOURTH gap class is real regardless: Lumen's per-cell state lives in slot 8
// (LumenPatternEngine, D-LM-buffer-slot-8) and the harness never supplied it. Nothing
// about that appears in the sidecar's declared routes, so the route-coverage test below
// cannot see it — hence the second test in this suite.
//
// OPEN, and deliberately not asserted either way: with slot 8 now driven, it changes
// Lumen's output by exactly zero, and so do the stems. That is consistent EITHER with
// dead coupling in production OR with the harness still lacking setup the app performs at
// preset activation (Lumen's per-track palette load). Verify against a live capture before
// concluding — do not infer a production defect from harness evidence alone.
//
// So: assert that every primitive any replayable preset DECLARES in its sidecar is a
// primitive the harness actually carries. A new route on an uncarried primitive fails
// here instead of silently producing a dead render months later.
