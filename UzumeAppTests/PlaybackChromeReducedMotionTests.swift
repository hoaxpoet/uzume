// PlaybackChromeReducedMotionTests — under reduced motion the chrome holds still. (DS.6)
//
// DESIGN.md §Shared States and Motion: reduced motion removes continuous animation.
// The two chrome surfaces that animate on their own — the reactive-mode pulse in the
// session dots and the listening badge's spinner — both guard their `repeatForever`
// on `reduceMotion`. This renders them with it on, twice, and asserts the pixels did
// not move. A regression that starts either animation unconditionally fails here.
