# capture_hang.sh — grab the evidence for BUG-085 while the app is STILL FROZEN.
#
# The whole reason BUG-085 is filable is that Matt left a frozen app running instead of
# force-quitting it. BUG-060 and the Volumetric Lithograph "~3.7 min crash" both sat
# unactionable for want of exactly this. Run this BEFORE force-quitting; it takes ~15 s and
# writes everything to one directory.
#
#   Scripts/capture_hang.sh
#
# Safe to run any time — if the app is healthy it just records a healthy sample.
