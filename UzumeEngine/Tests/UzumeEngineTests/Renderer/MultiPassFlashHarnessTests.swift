// MultiPassFlashHarnessTests — CLEAN.7.6c. The faithful multi-pass / feedback half of
// the photosensitivity flash-safety gate (GAP-9). It closes the certified presets the
// single-pass FeatureVector harness (`PhotosensitivityCertificationTests`) renders static
// because their music response arrives through multi-pass rendering:
//
//   - Lumen Mosaic — ray_march + post_process + the 4-light CPU follower (slot 8)
//   - Dragon Bloom / Fata Morgana / Skein / Nacre / Floret / Glaze — mv_warp feedback
//   - Filigree / Mitosis / Cytokinesis — geometry-driven particle colonies
//
// Each is driven over the shared worst-case beat + stem train, its rendered full-frame
// WCAG relative luminance is measured by `FlashAnalyzer`, and the Harding/WCAG 2.3.1
// ≤ 3 flashes/s limit is asserted. Over-limit ⇒ a P1 safety finding to bring to Matt,
// NOT a number to tune away — the certified beat-luminance motion was hand-built safe
// (D-157 bounded per-beat footprint + steady global luminance; D-158).
//
// QG.3.1: the real render bodies moved to the shared `MultiPassRenderHarness` (one faithful
// headless render for two consumers — this gate + the QG.3 coupling report). This file now
// supplies the flash-specific drive (synthetic worst-case beat train) and reducer (WCAG
// relative luminance) and keeps the flash assertions. The render itself is unchanged.
//
// GPU test — manual-closeout suite. Drive + luminance primitives are shared with the
// single-pass gate via `FlashHarnessSupport`.
