// PrepStageTiming — PREP.1 per-stage preparation timing. MEASUREMENT ONLY.
//
// D-242 set a 7.5 s/track budget for session preparation and recorded that no
// per-stage timing existed for the local-file path. This is that timing: one
// row per (track, stage) with wall clock, process CPU consumed during the
// stage, and the track's decoded duration, written as a `preparation.csv`
// sidecar beside `features.csv` / `stems.csv` in the session directory.
//
// **The gate.** Nothing here runs unless `UZUME_PREP_TIMING=1` is in the
// environment. `PrepStageSink.ifEnabled(...)` returns `nil` otherwise, so a
// normal session carries `PrepStageProbe.disabled` down the call chain and
// nothing else — no timestamps taken, no rows allocated, no file opened. Call
// sites read `probe.measure(PrepStage.decode) { ... }`, which falls straight
// through to the body when the probe is disabled.
//
// **Reading `cpu_cores`.** `cpu_ms / wall_ms` — CPU-seconds burned per wall
// second, i.e. how many cores the stage held on average. ~1.0 is one saturated
// core, ~8 is eight, and « 1.0 means the process was waiting (disk, or a GPU
// command buffer). It is process-wide (`getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF)`), so it is
// only meaningful when one track is being prepared at a time; a concurrent
// run's CPU column attributes every worker's cost to whichever stage happened
// to be open. Wall clock stays correct either way.
