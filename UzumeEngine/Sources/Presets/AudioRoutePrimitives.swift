// AudioRoutePrimitives — the canonical map from an `audio_routes` primitive name
// (Swift FeatureVector/StemFeatures field) to the session-CSV column that records
// it. Single source for two consumers (QG.1):
//
//   • AudioRouteSchemaTests — an `audio_routes.primitive` not in this map fails
//     the schema gate (catches typos / fields with no recordable column).
//   • RouteCoverageTests — resolves each declared primitive to its per-frame
//     series from a replayed session directory to assert per-kind activity.
//
// Only primitives that a preset can legitimately route AND that the session
// recorder writes belong here. Diagnostic/perf columns (frame_cpu_ms, …) and
// non-audio fields (time, deltaTime, aspect) are deliberately absent — they are
// not routes. CPU-derived StemFeatures fields the offline fixture cannot populate
// (cachedBassProportion, totalEnergySmoothed, auroraPalettePhase,
// auroraOrbitAzimuth, drumsEnergyDevSmoothed) are also absent: they exist on the
// type but the route-coverage fixture mechanism can't exercise them, so they are
// documented as a coverage gap rather than declared (see QG1_REPLAY_AUDIT.md).
