// WitchlightPath — the pen, the trail, and the music that steers them.
//
// Pure CPU model, no Metal: `WitchlightStroke` owns the buffers and pipelines and calls
// `advance` once per frame; this file owns everything that decides WHERE the pen goes and
// WHAT COLOUR it lays down. Split out so the path generator is unit-testable against
// synthetic driver inputs without a GPU (`WitchlightPathTests`).
//
// The three mechanisms, in the order `advance` runs them (WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN §3.1):
//
//   (a) HEADING — the harmonic steer. `tonalPhaseFifths` is a ±π circular quantity with a
//       measured median per-frame step of 0.31–1.04 rad, far too noisy to steer a pen raw.
//       It is smoothed by the CR.1.2 / D-198 mechanism already shipped in Uzume: EMA
//       the sin and cos separately and recombine with `atan2`. NEVER EMA the raw sawtooth.
//
//   (b) ADVANCE — bounded-curvature kinematics (Dubins 1957). Moved to
//       `WitchlightPath+Pen.swift` at WL.9 for the 400-line lint; the rationale lives
//       with the code.
//
//   (c) RELAXATION — age-weighted neighbour averaging (discrete Laplacian curve smoothing,
//       the Taubin λ|μ family). Full weight on beads younger than ~1 s, zero by ~4 s, and
//       FROZEN beyond. The source relaxes its whole buffer forever, which is why its figure
//       slumps; freezing the old part is what makes "a drawing of where the song has been"
//       true rather than decorative.
//
// Deviation semantics throughout (D-026 / FA #31): every driver is read against a
// per-track running reference, never against an absolute level on an AGC-normalized value.
