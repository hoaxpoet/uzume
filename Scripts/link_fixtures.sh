# Make the gitignored assets a worktree needs runnable inside that worktree.
#
# Several trees are deliberately kept out of git — copyrighted audio fixtures,
# ML weights (shipped as the `ml-weights-v1` Release asset since PUB.2), and
# reference/diagnostic images (untracked since the LFS cutover, D-211). Git
# worktrees and fresh clones never receive any of them, so the tests and the
# preset workflow that depend on them fail — or silently degrade — in a
# worktree. See memory `project_worktree_engine_fixtures_absent`.
#
# This symlinks each such gitignored file from the PRIMARY checkout (the main
# worktree) into the current worktree. Idempotent; a no-op on the primary and
# for files already present.
#
# BUG-080 (2026-08-03) — two failures this script previously had, both fixed here:
#
#   Gap A: the ML weights were never in the list, AND the match filter admitted
#     only Tests/Fixtures paths or jpg/jpeg/png/gif, so a `.bin` could not pass
#     even once the directory was added. 479 files never reached a worktree.
#
#   Gap B, the deeper one: this script trusted the primary checkout to be a
#     COMPLETE source and never verified it. `Tests/Fixtures/tempo/` was absent
#     from the primary entirely — the clips lived only inside one other
#     worktree — so no worktree could obtain them, the primary failed the same
#     gate, and this script reported success while propagating the hole.
#     A `required` flag now makes an empty source tree a HARD ERROR.
#
# The rule this encodes: a preparation script that cannot supply what it
# promises must fail loudly, never report success. Same philosophy as
# BeatThisFixturePresenceGate (QR.3), which is what caught Gap B.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/link_fixtures.sh            run once after `git worktree add`
#   Scripts/link_fixtures.sh --verify   check the PRIMARY is a complete source
#                                       and exit non-zero if not; links nothing.
#                                       Runnable from the primary itself.
