// RenderPipeline+RayMarch — Deferred ray march draw path (Increment 3.14).
//
// `drawWithRayMarch` is a render path parallel to `drawDirect`, `drawWithFeedback`,
// `drawWithPostProcess`, `drawWithMeshShader`, and `drawWithICB`.  It is invoked from
// `renderFrame` when `rayMarchEnabled == true` and a `RayMarchPipeline` is attached.
//
// The method delegates all G-buffer, lighting, and composite encoding to
// `RayMarchPipeline.render(...)`.  It only acquires the drawable and resolves the
// optional PostProcessChain for the bloom path.
//
// Priority in renderFrame(): mesh → postProcess → ICB → rayMarch → feedback → direct.
