    /// Matt after WL.7: *"Ribbon feels connected to the music, though how is not obvious."*
    /// Measured on his session `2026-08-05T21-48-13Z` (`WitchlightBeatAlignmentProbe`), the
    /// old `bassDev` trigger fired 110 times in 215 s with a **mean offset of 0.250 beats**
    /// from the nearest beat — 0.25 is exactly the value uniformly-random firing produces,
    /// and 19 % landed within 10 % of a beat against a 20 % chance rate. The one thing in
    /// this preset that flashed in TIME had no relationship to the rhythm whatsoever.
    ///
    /// Everything else here is on a continuous envelope, which is why it reads as connected;
    /// nothing landed on the pulse, which is why "how" was invisible. The beat data was
    /// never missing — the grid locked at 171 BPM in 4/4, and 140 of 141 downbeats already
    /// promoted a bead. But a promoted bead is a mark in SPACE: it records where the downbeat
    /// happened and then drifts away with the trail. Nothing happened at the MOMENT.
    ///
    /// Per bar, not per beat, and that is Matt's call from the measured rates: at 171 BPM a
    /// beat is 0.35 s, so a per-beat head flash is ~2.9/s — strobe territory, and the §5
    /// flash budget would cap the amplitude until each pulse landed soft. A bar is 1.40 s
    /// (0.71/s), which leaves the full `flareCeiling` usable.
    ///
    /// One primitive per visual layer (FA #67): this REPLACES `bassDev` on the head rather
    /// than joining it. Two accent primitives on one layer is the documented "fighting
    /// itself" bug, and the one being removed was measurably noise against the rhythm.
