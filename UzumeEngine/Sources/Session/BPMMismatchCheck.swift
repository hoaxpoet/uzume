// BPMMismatchCheck — Detect disagreement between the offline BeatGrid (Beat This!)
// BPM and the MIR-derived BPM (DSP.1 trimmed-mean IOI on sub_bass).
//
// Pure function. No I/O, no logging, no Sendable concerns. Caller is responsible
// for adding track context (title) and emitting whatever log line it wants.
//
// Background (BUG-008): the two estimators occasionally disagree by enough to
// matter — Love Rehab's offline BeatGrid returns 118 BPM while the MIR
// estimator returns ~125. Neither is mechanically "right" (BUG-008.1 diagnosis
// in `docs/diagnostics/BUG-008-diagnosis.md` documents the per-estimator
// reasoning); the fix is to surface the disagreement at preparation time so
// future per-track judgment is informed by data rather than tags.
//
// This file does NOT decide which estimator to consume at runtime. The
// LiveBeatDriftTracker continues to compare against the offline BeatGrid
// (CachedTrackData.beatGrid). That is intentional — see BUG-008.2 prompt.
