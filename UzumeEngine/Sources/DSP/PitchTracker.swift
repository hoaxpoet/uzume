// PitchTracker — YIN autocorrelation-based pitch detector for vocal stems.
//
// Implements the YIN algorithm (de Cheveigné & Kawahara, 2002) using vDSP
// dot-product for the difference function.  No ML required.  The input is
// the separated vocals waveform from StemAnalyzer; pitch estimates are
// written into StemFeatures.vocalsPitchHz / vocalsPitchConfidence.
//
// **2026-05-19 fix (P0 — vocalsPitchConfidence was 0 % in every session).**
// The tracker accumulates incoming samples into an internal 2048-sample
// ring buffer; YIN runs on the full buffer once it's been filled at least
// once. Callers can pass any window size (live path: 1024; SessionPreparer:
// 1024; unit tests: 2048+) and the tracker reassembles a valid YIN window
// across calls. Before the fix, the live caller passed 1024-sample windows
// directly to YIN — `fillWindow()` zero-padded the first half of the
// internal buffer, making the cross-correlation in the difference function
// structurally zero (`base[0..1024]` was all zeros, so dotpr = 0 for every
// τ), so the CMNDF never dipped below the 0.15 threshold and `findMinimum`
// always returned -1 → `(hz: 0, confidence: 0)` every frame. The bug was
// invisible to PitchTrackerTests because the tests pass full 2048-sample
// windows directly. Same test/prod parity gap as Aurora Veil's recent
// cascade — CLAUDE.md "test in production-grade pipeline" rule applies.
//
// Algorithm steps (§ references are to the YIN paper):
//   1. Difference function d[τ] = Σ_{j=0}^{W/2−1} (x[j] − x[j+τ])²
//                               = r[0] + r[τ] − 2c[τ]
//      where r[τ] = auto-power of x[τ..τ+halfWindow] and
//            c[τ] = cross-correlation of x[0..halfWindow] × x[τ..τ+halfWindow].
//      Computed via vDSP_dotpr for efficiency.
//   2. CMNDF d'[τ] = d[τ] / ((1/τ) × Σ_{j=1}^{τ} d[j])  with d'[0] = 1.
//   3. Find the first τ in [minTau, maxTau] where d'[τ] < threshold (0.15).
//   4. Parabolic interpolation for sub-sample τ accuracy.
//   5. pitch = sampleRate / τ_refined; valid range 80–1000 Hz.
//   6. Confidence = 1 − d'[τ]; threshold at 0.6 → report 0 Hz if below.
//   7. EMA smoothing (decay 0.8) on valid pitches to suppress jitter.
//      Zero immediately when confidence drops below threshold.
//
// Window: 2048 samples.  τ range: sampleRate/1000 to sampleRate/80.
// At 44.1 kHz: τ ∈ [44, 551] samples.
//
// Performance: each process() call makes 2×(maxTau−minTau+1) vDSP_dotpr
// calls of length halfWindow=1024.  On Apple Silicon (~0.2ms per call).
// Called at ~94 Hz from StemAnalyzer.analyze() under its NSLock.
