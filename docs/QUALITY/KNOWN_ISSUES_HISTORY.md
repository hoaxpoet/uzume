### BUG-102 — RESOLVED (BUG102.1 / BUG102.2): BeatBench's money and bleed references were at an untrusted metrical level (2026-08-19 → 2026-08-27)

Both carried `status: metrical_review`, both reference backends said the taps were an octave off,
and Matt would not vouch for his tapping on them. Everything scored against those two tracks was
uncitable, including the whole of suite 4.

**Resolved by re-annotation, not by editing JSON.** Both re-tapped at the quarter note over 90 s
spans (the set's norm is 87–99 s). **They hid opposite truths, which is the lesson worth keeping:
a benchmark scored against untrusted ground truth does not fail loudly — it reports confident
numbers in both directions.**

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| **bleed** → `confirmed` @ 114.67, meter 4 | F 0.61 · CMLt **0.03** · AMLt 0.84 | F 0.99 · CMLt **1.00** · AMLt 1.00 |
| **money** → `arbitrated_taps` @ 121.06, meter 7 | F 0.58 · CMLt 0.00 · AMLt **0.88** | F 0.44 · CMLt 0.43 · AMLt **0.43** |

- **bleed** hid a grid that was **right** — suite 4 was never a tracking problem, and BUG-076's
  "115 matches madmom/librosa/drums-stem" note is vindicated (the repo had been asserting both
  115 and 226.72 at once).
- **money** hid one that is **wrong** → **BUG-107**. Its taps also sat −45 ms early against both
  backends (which agree to 2.4 ms); Matt arbitrated in the taps' favour — a visualizer fires
  where a listener feels the pulse. Recorded in `Tests/Fixtures/beatbench/arbitrations.json` via
  `reconcile.py`'s new arbitration path, never hand-edited.

**⚠ Scope, per BUG107.2:** the offline grid only ever analyses the first ~30 s of any input, so
**bleed's F 0.99 is a result over its opening ~30 s, not the full track.** Quote it that way.

**Consequences.** Suite 2's ratified baseline is now AMLt 1.00 / 1.00 / **0.43** / 0.75 / 0.21;
money moved to **suite 3** (its ~17 % tempo rise is a suite-3 property). `reconcile.py`'s
`UZUME_GRID` context dict was also a stale 2026-07-27 snapshot showing a third apparent
metrical level; re-measured. Rejected tap passes preserved under `taps/pre-BUG102/`.

### BUG-109 — Stem values change ~8×/s where the series grid is 43 Hz: the smoothed position may not be reaching the sample (2026-08-27)

**Status: ANSWERED 2026-08-27 by the instrumented session `2026-08-27T16-53-29Z`. The cause is
neither of the two the entry proposed — it is a SAMPLING CADENCE, and the fix is a one-line move.**

`STEM_SOURCE: series frames=10815 covers=251.1s hop=23.2ms` — the series is installed and driving.
`stem_series_pos_s` is populated on **100 %** of rows with **0 backward steps**, so the smoother is
being reached and is working. But over 6,521 rows it takes only **1,398 distinct values**:

| | rate |
|---|---|
| rows in `features.csv` | 59.9 Hz |
| distinct sampling positions | **12.8 Hz** |
| the series' own grid | 43 Hz |

**Two facts, and neither is a defect in the smoother.**

1. **`features.csv` has one row per RENDER frame, not per analysis frame.** `SessionRecorder
   .recordFrame` is documented as "record one rendered frame" and is called from the
   command-buffer completion handler. Between analysis frames the recorder repeats the last
   value, which is the 79 % "held" reading — an artifact of two rates, not a stuck position.
2. **The series is sampled once per ANALYSIS frame (~12.8 Hz) while the renderer draws at 60 Hz.**
   That is the whole of BUG-109. Stem values change ~13 times a second, so a preset drawing at
   60 fps holds each value for ~4.6 frames.

**★ The fix — ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-08-27 (LFSTEM.1e).** Sessions
`2026-08-27T17-51-58Z` and `18-17-50Z` sample the series at **56–58 Hz** where this entry measured
12.8, with `STEM_SOURCE` reporting the series driving throughout. Matt's M7 on the second:
*"Looks good."* Live
separation was bounded by audio arrival: it could not publish faster than analysis frames because
there was nothing new to publish. **A pre-analysed series has no such bound — sampling it is an
array lookup.** `publishStemSeriesFrame` now runs once per RENDER frame from a dedicated
`RenderPipeline.perFrameStemPublish` hook, so stem motion is limited by the series' own 43 Hz grid
rather than by the 12.8 Hz analysis rate.

Three details that decide whether it works rather than merely runs:

- **It publishes BEFORE the frame snapshots its stems.** `renderFrame` reads `latestStemFeatures`
  once and uses that snapshot for the particles update, the preset tick and the draw, so
  publishing after it would land a frame late — the off-by-one-frame class this whole arc has
  been about. `StemSeriesWiringTests` asserts the ordering in the source.
- **It is a separate hook from `meshPresetTick`.** That slot is owned by whichever preset needs
  per-frame state — Skein sets it for its painter clock — and one closure cannot serve both.
- **The analysis frame no longer samples**; it only publishes the playback clock the render frame
  samples with. `applyStemSeriesFrame` is deleted rather than left beside its replacement, and the
  smoother is now touched from one thread only, behind `stemSeriesLock`.

⚠ **A CORRECTION THIS SESSION FORCED, recorded because it is already published elsewhere.**
BUG110.3's note that "the analysis loop now runs at 59.9 Hz where pre-fix local sessions ran at
~18 Hz, so part of BUG-087's ceiling was the GPU starving the loop" is **WRONG**. Those were
RENDER rates: 18 fps pre-fix (consistent with 170–250 ms frames) and 60 fps after. The analysis
rate was never measured that way, and **BUG-087's ceiling claim is untouched** by it. The row-rate
was read as an analysis rate — the same class of mistake as reading a metric by its name.

Found while confirming BUG-110 on session `2026-08-27T16-17-34Z` (local file, Skein, 4K, 78 s,
analysis at 59.9 Hz). The numbers that do not add up:

| | count |
|---|---|
| analysis frames | 4,620 |
| distinct `playback_time_s` (the RAW 100 ms clock) | **1,010** |
| distinct `drumsEnergyDev` values | **634** |
| series frames available over 78 s (23.2 ms grid) | ~3,360 |

**Stem values change fewer times than the raw clock ticks.** That is the part that rules things
out: `PlaybackClockSmoother` is monotone and resyncs on every tick, so a series sampled through it
must produce *at least* one new position per tick, and dead reckoning should add more between
ticks. Replaying this session's own clock through the shipped smoother predicts a new series index
on ~70 % of frames (0 backward, 0 rewound). The recorded values instead change about once per
121 ms — which is the raw clock's tick, not the smoothed position.

So either the smoothed position is not reaching `StemFeatureSeries.sample`, or the values written
to `stems.csv` are not the ones the series produced. **Both are wiring questions, not tuning
questions, and neither is established.**

⚠ **The reason this took a session to notice is an instrumentation gap I introduced and flagged
once already:** the "series installed" line goes to `os.Logger`, not the session log, and the
SMOOTHED position is not recorded at all. `features.csv` carries the raw clock only. A per-track
surface that changes what every stem-driven preset reads should be visible in the artifact.

**Next step — instrument before theorising. ✅ DONE 2026-08-27 (BUG109.1), awaiting one session.**
`features.csv` gained `stem_series_pos_s` — the position the series was sampled at, after the
smoother, EMPTY when no series is installed — and `session.log` gained a `STEM_SOURCE:` line at
track change naming the source and the series' size. No sampling behaviour was changed.

**What the next local-file session decides, with no further inference:**

| observation | conclusion |
|---|---|
| column empty throughout | no series installed; live separation drove everything, and LFSTEM.1's claim is untested live |
| position advances per frame, stem values hold | sampling is fine; the values reaching `stems.csv` are not the series' |
| position holds with the raw clock | the smoother is not being reached at the sample site |

**Related:** LFSTEM.1c (the sampling), LFSTEM.1d (the smoother, whose own replay is clean on this
session's clock), BUG-110 (found during its live confirmation, unrelated mechanism).

### BUG-108 — FIXED (pending M7): Skein's overlap colour was a per-fragment argmax with no tie-break, so it flickered where two coloured marks cross (2026-08-27)

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-27 — M7 PASSED.** Matt on the round-2 build, session
`2026-08-27T18-17-50Z`: *"Looks good."* 106 s of Skein at 4K — well past the 70–80 s mark where
the round-1 residual appeared — with the series driving, sampling at 58.3 Hz and `frame_gpu` p50
flat at 12.08–13.76 ms.

**Fixed in two rounds, both the same defect at different levels.**

**Round 2 (same day).** Matt on the round-1 build: *"Flickering still happens but only after
significant time has passed (70-80 s) and is not as prominent as before. Frame rate is smooth."*
Round 1 fixed which **mark** wins an overlap. Inside the pour line, the colour was still taken
from the **nearest segment** — `if (d < lineSDF) { … lineCol = … }` — which is the same argmin one
level down. Two segments of DIFFERENT pours that are near-equidistant from a fragment flip the
winner on sub-pixel motion, and the flip is a full colour swap.

**That explains both halves of what Matt saw.** *Less prominent*, because the mark-level case was
genuinely fixed and only the line-internal one remained. *Only after 70–80 s*, because such pairs
require differently-coloured segments inside the same 40-frame tail, and colour breakpoints
accumulate over a track — the same ring whose filling drove BUG-110's cost ramp.

The line now takes the colour of the **first covering segment in a newest→oldest walk**, which is
the latest-laid one by construction — no comparison, nothing to jitter. Coverage still comes from
the nearest segment (`lineSDF = min(lineSDF, d)`), and fragments no segment covers keep the
nearest colour, since nothing is laid over anything in the anti-aliased fringe.

**Round 1 status: fixed 2026-08-27 — Matt chose (a), the lay-order tie-break — and PENDING HIS M7.**
Colour now goes to the mark laid LAST that substantially covers the fragment (`spawnTau` for a
burst, the nearest drawn segment's painter clock for the pour line), via `skeinClaimMark`.
Coverage is unchanged as the alpha, and the old argmax survives only as the fringe fallback where
no mark covers a fragment by more than `kSkeinColourClaim` (0.5) — there is no laid-over
relationship between two anti-aliased edges, and those fragments read as canvas anyway. No
blending is introduced, so the §colour-mud rule is untouched.

⚠ **The perception check this entry demanded is NOT met, and is not being quietly dropped.** The
criterion was "a rendered A/B at a known overlap, showing the boundary stable across consecutive
frames". It cannot be produced with the seams that exist: `SkeinState` spawns bursts from audio,
so two overlapping bursts of KNOWN different colours at a KNOWN position cannot be staged, and no
offline harness renders Skein's marks at all (`PresetVisualReviewTests` does not cover it; the
`PresetRegressionTests` golden is `0x8080808080808080`, a uniform hash of a single frame with no
`SkeinState` bound — which is also why the goldens do not move here, and why they are NOT evidence
that nothing changed). **Building that seam is its own increment.** Until then the verification is
Matt's M7 plus the structural gate below.

**What IS gated automatically:** `SkeinCanvasHoldTest` asserts the property rather than the
arithmetic — no site may select colour by a coverage comparison, every mark routes through
`skeinClaimMark`, and the claim decides on lay time. A frozen quantity cannot jitter, so a
boundary decided by lay time cannot flicker; if a future edit reintroduces the argmax, the flicker
comes back with it and the gate goes red.

**Original status: open, mechanism identified in source, fix was a look decision.** Matt, on session
`2026-08-27T14-33-03Z`: *"still seeing some flickering in the areas of overlap between two
different-colors lines."*

**The mechanism, from the shader.** `Skein.metal` composites marks OPAQUELY on purpose — the
§colour-mud audit rejected averaging two stem colours, because a blend of two paints reads as the
dead-mat anti-reference. Every contribution runs:

```metal
if (cov > bestCover) { bestCover = cov; bestCol = col; }   // ×8 sites, lines 399–558
```

So a fragment takes the colour of whichever mark **covers it most**. That is a hard argmax with
**no tie-break and no hysteresis**, and its decision boundary is the contour where two marks'
coverage is equal. On that contour the winner is decided by whatever is smallest in the frame —
sub-pixel painter motion, the per-frame radius (`lineWiden` moves with `lineVisc`/`lineFlow`,
both audio-driven), a coverage difference in the sixth decimal. Any of that flips the winner, and
the flip is a full colour swap because the rule is deliberately discrete. **Flicker at overlaps is
what this rule does by construction**, not a symptom of something upstream.

**Why it is showing up now, and why that does not make it LFSTEM's defect.** LFSTEM.1 replaced
stem values that arrived 2.5 s late and heavily smoothed with values that arrive on time and move
at their own rate, so the audio-driven radius terms move more per frame than they used to — more
crossings of the equal-coverage contour per second, so a latent instability became visible. The
instability itself predates it: nothing in the argmax has changed since Skein certified (2026-06-11).
LFSTEM.1d fixed the two real defects on the reading side (a 100 ms-quantised clock, then a position
that rewound on 1 % of frames); replayed against this session's own clock the shipped smoother
produces **0 backward positions and 0 rewound series frames**, so what Matt is still seeing is not
the clock.

**Fix options — a look decision, not an engineering one.**

- **(a) Stable tie-break by lay order.** At an overlap, prefer the mark laid LATER rather than the
  one with more coverage. Physically what paint does, and lay order does not jitter, so the
  boundary stops flickering. Changes which colour wins in some overlaps — a visible change to a
  certified preset.
- **(b) A narrow blend band.** Blend the two colours only where coverage is within ε, a few pixels
  wide. Keeps the discrete rule everywhere else. ⚠ This is the one the §colour-mud audit ruled
  against; ε would have to stay genuinely narrow or it reintroduces the mud.
- **(c) Quantise the decision.** Compare coverage at reduced precision so sixth-decimal differences
  cannot flip the winner. Cheapest, but it converts a flicker into a stable-but-arbitrary choice
  and does nothing where the coverages genuinely cross.

Recommendation was **(a)**, and **Matt chose (a) on 2026-08-27**. It is the only one with a
physical justification, it removes the instability rather than damping it, and it does not touch
the mud rule. It still needs Matt's eye on which colour wins at overlaps afterwards.

**Verification criteria (before any fix).**
- [ ] A rendered A/B at a known overlap — two marks of different stem colour crossing — showing the boundary stable across consecutive frames with the same audio input. ⚠ **NOT MET — the seam does not exist** (bursts spawn from audio; no offline harness renders Skein's marks). Its own increment; see the status note.
- [x] No blending introduced, so the §colour-mud anti-reference cannot be reached by this change: `skeinClaimMark` selects one mark's colour, never mixes two.
- [x] `PresetRegressionTests` Skein goldens: **unchanged, and that is not evidence** — the golden is `0x8080808080808080`, a uniform hash of one frame rendered with no `SkeinState`, so the harness paints no marks and this change has nothing to act on there.
- [x] Structural gate: `SkeinCanvasHoldTest` fails if colour is ever selected by a coverage comparison again.
- [x] **Matt's M7: the overlaps stop flickering AND the colour that wins is the right one.** Round 1's report — *"still happens but only after 70–80 s and is not as prominent"* — located the residual (the line-internal argmin) rather than refuting the fix; round 2 addressed it and round 2's M7 passed on a 106 s run.

**Related:** LFSTEM.1d (fixed the reading side; not this), BUG-110 (Skein's cost ramp, same
session, unrelated mechanism), Skein.4.1 / the §colour-mud audit (why the rule is discrete).

### BUG-110 — FIXED (BUG110.2): the fragment recomputed the painter's whole tail for every pixel (2026-08-27)

> **Renumbered 107 → 110 at merge.** Filed as BUG-107 against a tree where 106 was the highest; a
> parallel session landed a *different* BUG-107 (money's prep grid, `b35c2897`) on `main` first, and
> `DocIntegrityTests` gates BUG-number uniqueness. **The commits on this branch are titled
> `[BUG110.1]` / `[BUG110.2]` / `[BUG110.3]` — they mean this entry.** Same collision, same
> resolution as BUG-082 and BUG-105.

**Status: ✅ FIXED AND CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-08-27.** Session `2026-08-27T16-17-34Z`, Skein at
3840×2160 for 78 s:

| t (s) | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frame_gpu` p50 | 12.59 | 12.62 | 12.48 | 13.10 | 12.23 | 11.55 |

**Flat, mildly decreasing, against 38 → 127 → 170–250 ms in both pre-fix sessions.** The ramp is
gone and the plateau is ~14× cheaper. `GPU_PRESSURE` 4.6–4.8 %, `ml_forced=0`, thermal nominal.

⚠ **~~A second-order effect worth recording: the analysis loop now runs at 59.9 Hz…~~ RETRACTED
2026-08-27.** That read `features.csv`'s row rate as the analysis rate. Rows are **RENDER** frames
(`SessionRecorder.recordFrame`, called from the command-buffer completion handler), so the numbers
were 18 fps of rendering pre-fix — consistent with 170–250 ms frames — and 60 fps after. The
analysis rate was never measured that way, and **BUG-087's ceiling claim is untouched**. Measured
properly on `2026-08-27T16-53-29Z` via the new `stem_series_pos_s` column, the analysis rate is
**12.8 Hz** (BUG-109).

**What is left is not GPU-bound:** `frame_cpu` p50 ~28.5 ms (≈35 fps) against a 12.6 ms GPU, so
the remaining gap is in the wall-clock path (which includes the blocking `currentDrawable` wait),
not in the shader this fixed.

**Original status: fixed 2026-08-27 — the hoist landed; live 4K confirmation owed.** `skeinLineLookupAt`
and `skeinPainterPos` both depend only on the painter clock, the seed phases and the breakpoint
ring — **never on fragment position** — and both were being recomputed for all 41 tail samples of
every one of 8.3 M fragments. `SkeinState.resolveTail` now produces those 41 samples once per
frame into a `SkeinTailGPU` table and the fragment reads it.

Measured on the same harness that found the defect (marks overlay, 3840×2160, min of 6 warm frames):

| `breakCount` | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (layer gated off) | 0.75 ms | 0.87 ms |
| 1 | **17.06 ms** | **4.77 ms** (3.6×) |
| 4 | 27.36 ms | 4.58 ms |
| **16** (ring cap) | **55.65 ms** | **3.67 ms** (15×) |

**The `breakCount` dependence is gone** — the curve is now flat, and mildly *decreasing*, because
more pours mean more skipped bridge segments and so fewer segment-distance evaluations. What
remains is the tail's own 40 SDF evaluations, which genuinely do depend on the fragment.

⚠ **Live confirmation is owed.** The overlay is one of several passes; the ~170 ms live figure also
carries the base pass, warp, comp/sheen and presentation. A 4K Skein session is what says how much
of the ramp this removed. `SkeinLineCostTests.hoistedTailDrawsInTheRightPlace` guards correctness
meanwhile — it renders the marks and asserts the paint lands on the painter's own path, and goes
red on an 8-byte offset drift in the table.

#### The defect as filed — Skein costs 15.6 ms at 4K cold and ~170 ms after 50 s of playback

**Status: MECHANISM ESTABLISHED 2026-08-27 by direct measurement — not yet fixed.** Two findings,
both from `SkeinLineCostTests` (`UZUME_SKEIN_COST=1`), which binds a synthetic `SkeinUniforms`
and times the real marks overlay at 3840×2160 (min of 6 warm frames):

| `breakCount` | marks overlay |
|---|---|
| **0** | **0.75 ms** ← what `PresetFrameBudgetTests` measures |
| 1 | **17.06 ms** |
| 2 | 22.00 ms |
| 4 | 27.36 ms |
| 8 | 36.58 ms |
| **16** (the ring cap) | **55.65 ms** |

**★ Finding 1 — the frame-budget harness measures Skein with its most expensive layer switched
off.** The whole pour-line layer sits behind `if (int(st.breakCount) > 0)`, and the harness binds
a zeroed slot-6 buffer: no committed pour, no line, no marks. **0.75 ms against 17.06 ms the
moment one breakpoint exists.** Skein's reported "15.60 ms at 4K, 0.8× the median preset" is the
base pass and overhead — it has never included the paint. This is a harness blind spot, not a
Skein-only fact: any preset whose expensive work is gated on runtime state the harness leaves
zeroed is measured the same way.

**★ Finding 2 — the ramp is the breakpoint ring filling.** `skeinLineLookupAt` is called once per
tail frame (`kSkeinTailFrames = 40`) per fragment, and scans the breakpoint ring (up to
`kSkeinMaxBreaks = 16`). As a track accumulates dominant-stem switches the scan lengthens, so
cost climbs **17.06 → 55.65 ms** and then plateaus when the ring caps — ramp-to-plateau, at
constant resolution and constant preset, which is exactly the live shape. At 8.3 M fragments the
worst case is 40 × 16 = **640 scan iterations per fragment**.

**★ The fix is a hoist, and it is a large one.** `skeinLineLookupAt(ctau, st)` depends only on the
tail's painter-clock values and the uniform ring — **not on the fragment position**. All 40
lookups are therefore fragment-invariant and are being recomputed for every one of 8.3 M
fragments. Resolving the 40 `(colour, offset, start)` triples once per frame and passing them in
removes both the per-fragment scan and the `breakCount` dependence outright. Expected to take the
16-breakpoint case back toward the 17 ms floor; the remaining cost is the tail's own 40 SDF
evaluations, which is a separate question.

**Original status: open, measured, mechanism not established.** Found while diagnosing Matt's "Skein's
performance is a little twitchy at fullscreen" on session `2026-08-27T13-24-37Z`. Filed separately
from the twitchiness itself (**LFSTEM.1d**, the stem staircase) because they are different
findings and only one of them is understood.

**Expected.** A preset's cost at a given resolution is roughly what the frame-budget harness
measures for it. Skein is one of the cheapest presets in the roster there.

**Actual, measured two ways on the same day:**

| | Skein at 3840×2160 |
|---|---|
| `PresetFrameBudgetTests` (`FRAME_BUDGET_RES=3840x2160`, 30 frames, no audio) | **15.60 ms** — 0.8× the median preset |
| Live, session `2026-08-27T13-24-37Z`, t≈7 s | ~21 ms |
| Live, same session, t≈50 s | ~165 ms |
| Live, same session, t≈60–180 s | plateau ~170 ms (≈6 fps) |

The rise is monotonic over roughly the first 50 s and then flat — **a ramp to a plateau, at
constant resolution and constant preset**. `renderframe_cpu_ms` tracks it (10 → 87 ms), which is
mostly the blocking `currentDrawable` wait, not app work. `GPU_PRESSURE` is flat at 620 MB / 5.1 %
of budget, `ml_forced=0`, thermal `nominal` throughout, so this is none of BUG-100's excluded
mechanisms.

**~~Candidate mechanism, NOT established~~ — the canvas-coverage theory was WRONG.** The original
guess was that cost scales with canvas coverage through the wetness-gated GGX sheen. It does not:
the comp pass's 13-tap wetness blur, gradient and specular are **unconditional per-pixel work**,
constant regardless of how much paint is on the canvas. The measurement above found the real
mechanism in the marks overlay instead. Recorded because the plausible-mechanism-that-fits-the-shape
is exactly what BUG-100 cost four reproduction attempts.

⚠ **Do not assume LFSTEM.1 caused this, and do not assume it did not.** The session that surfaced
it is also the first Skein session with a pre-analysed stem series, and that series was being read
through a 100 ms-quantised clock (LFSTEM.1d), which fires `flick_trigger` — an accent on all four
stems — on teleported deviation spikes. More flicks would mean more marks, which under the
candidate mechanism means a faster ramp. That is a hypothesis with a plausible mechanism and no
measurement behind it, which is the shape that produced BUG-100's four wasted reproduction
attempts. **The A/B is free**: LFSTEM.1d fixes the clock, so the next Skein 4K session either
still ramps (this is Skein's own, independent of stems) or does not (it was the flick rate).

**Reproduction.** 4K fullscreen, Skein, ~90 s of playback on a local file. The ramp is visible in
`features.csv` `frame_gpu_ms` without any special instrumentation.

**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm` (cost scaling with accumulated state) — provisional.

**Verification criteria.**
- [x] The ramp reproduced on the LFSTEM.1d build, same preset and resolution — 38 ms at t=14 s → 127 ms at t=40 s → ~170–250 ms, essentially identical to the pre-fix session. **The stem staircase was not inflating it.**
- [x] Cost measured as a function of the state that drives it, offline and repeatably: `SkeinLineCostTests`, the table above.
- [x] **The hoist implemented** (BUG110.2), with the same harness showing the `breakCount` dependence gone and the 16-breakpoint case at 3.67 ms — *below* the 1-breakpoint floor of 4.77 ms.
- [x] Re-measured at 4K **live** — session `2026-08-27T16-17-34Z`, `frame_gpu` p50 flat at 11.55–13.10 ms across 78 s of Skein, against 38 → 250 ms before.
- [x] **`PresetFrameBudgetTests` gains a mechanism for state-gated layers (PERF.17, 2026-08-27).** The root cause turned out to be broader than Skein: the shared drive built every band at exactly `0.5` — the AGC mean — and left every `Rel`/`Dev` field zero-initialised, so **the whole roster was timed at the one point where D-026's deviation primitives are identically zero**. Skein's pour-commit machine therefore never committed a second pour: the ring held **1** breakpoint where playback holds 16, and Skein read 5.31 ms, the cheapest third of the roster. The drive now sweeps the bands and derives Rel/Dev with the analyzer's own formula, stem dominance rotates on a ~1 s cycle, and `MultiPassRenderHarness.warmSkein` ticks the state to a full ring before the timed frames (the `openTheGates` pattern, for a gate that lives in Swift state rather than the drive vector). **Skein 5.31 → 13.19 ms**, 4th most expensive. `skeinIsMeasuredMidPainting` gates it with a cold control, so deleting the warm-up goes red instead of passing vacuously. All 21 baselines re-recorded.

**Related:** LFSTEM.1d (the twitchiness in the same session, understood and fixed), BUG-100 (closed
2026-08-26 — its mechanisms are excluded here by direct measurement, and this entry is NOT a
reopening: BUG-100's claim was app-wide degradation surviving a preset switch, this is one preset's
cost inside one preset).

### BUG-088 — RESOLVED (BUG088.1): Aurora Veil's "undeclared reads" were dead computation, and a silence gate is not a driver (2026-08-12, resolved 2026-08-26)

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-26.** The diagnosis below is kept in full because the correction
matters more than the fix: a capture said three primitives were live in the session, and that was
read as "the preset reads them." It does not. `AuroraVeil.metal` reads exactly the five fields its
sidecar declares; `AuroraVeilState` computed the other three into a buffer AV.7 stopped reading.

**Fix.** Deleted, not re-wired: `AuroraVeilState.swift`, the `AuroraVeilStateGPU` struct and
`[[buffer(6)]]` parameter in `AuroraVeil.metal`, the app-side property + `bindAuroraVeilRuntime`
wiring, the slot-6 bind in three test harnesses, and
`PresetSessionReplay/AuroraVeilRoutes.swift` (a second manifest for the same three deleted
routes — `--preset aurora_veil` no longer resolves). Recurrence guard: a new
`AudioRoute.Kind.gate` with its own floor (peak ≥ 0.9 on every fixture — the only failure a gate
has is never opening), and the three misdeclared `pulseAmp01` routes reclassified (Aurora Veil
`star_beat_twinkle`, Fractal Tree `silence_gate`, Ferrofluid Ocean `spike_punch_gate`).

**Verification.**
- [x] The manifest matches what the code reads — verified field-by-field against the shader source, not a capture.
- [x] `kind` distinguishes a gate from a driver — `Kind.gate`, documented in SHADER_CRAFT §17 and D-180's manifest line.
- [x] Gate arm proven to bite: floor raised to 1.5 → all three gate routes red at peak 1.00; restored → **201 routes / 21 presets / 0 red**.
- [x] No pixel moved: Aurora Veil's `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes unchanged (steady / beat-heavy / quiet).
- [x] Engine suite + `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp build` green.
- **No M7 required** — nothing rendered changes; the deleted state never reached a pixel.

**The withdrawn criterion, kept as the lesson.** "RouteCoverageTests sees `drumsEnergyDev` for
Aurora Veil after the fix" would have declared a route with no consumer and gated a value nothing
reads. A liveness capture tells you a primitive is alive in the SESSION; only the source tells
you the preset reads it. `Scripts/check_route_liveness.py` answers the first question — the
second one needs a grep.

---


**Diagnosis only, no fix.** Found because BUG-086's `dsp.stem` manual gate was aimed at
Aurora Veil and returned nothing — for a reason that had nothing to do with BUG-086.

#### How the wrong preset got picked (the process failure, recorded first)

The gate was aimed here on a stale note calling `other_energy_dev` Aurora Veil's
"song-defining anchor, never drop it." **Git contradicts it**: added at `e7cd6e3a`
(AV.2.2f), dropped at `e305839a` (AV.2.h, "drop 5 routes"), and **AV.7 / D-185 reauthored
the preset as a nimitz *Auroras* port onto mood envelopes rather than deviation
primitives** — deliberately, for a GENTLE preset. Aurora Veil declares **no stem route at
all**, so no stem-latency change could ever have shown up in it. A human review was spent
on a question a CSV could have answered first. `Scripts/check_route_liveness.py` exists so
that does not recur: **run it before aiming any manual review at a preset.**

#### Expected behavior

A preset's `audio_routes` manifest enumerates the primitives it reads, with a `kind` that
describes how each is used. QG.1 / D-180 route coverage depends on it being accurate.

#### Actual behavior — measured on capture `2026-08-12T19-57-29Z`

| route | declared | verdict | detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| `star_beat_twinkle` / `barPhase01` | ✅ accent | **ALIVE** | range 901 / 1000 |
| `star_beat_twinkle` / `pulseAmp01` | ✅ **continuous** | **DEAD** | pinned 1.000, p5–p95 range **0.000** |
| `veil_breathe` / `arousal` | ✅ | ALIVE | range 0.178 |
| `veil_breathe` / `bassAttRel` | ✅ | ALIVE | range 0.287, near-entirely negative |
| `mood_colour` / `valence` | ✅ | ALIVE | range 0.453 |
| `drumsEnergyDev` | ❌ **undeclared** | ALIVE | 61 % nonzero, p95 0.997 |
| `vocalsPitchHz` | ❌ **undeclared** | SPARSE | **0.1 % nonzero** |
| `vocalsPitchConfidence` | ❌ **undeclared** | SPARSE | **0.1 % nonzero** |

**`pulseAmp01` is not misbehaving.** The shader uses it as a silence gate, and a gate
pinned at 1.000 through music is exactly right. The defect is the **declaration**:
`kind: continuous` reads as a driver, and WL.1 already measured this primitive as a silence
gate with no dynamic range and ruled it out as a hero driver. That lesson did not propagate
into this manifest.

**The real gaps** are the three undeclared reads. `drumsEnergyDev` is Aurora Veil's only
live stem input and QG.1 cannot see it; the vocals-pitch pair is garnish at 0.1 % — WL.1
measured the same primitive at 4.5 % and called it garnish there too.

#### Suspected failure class

`documentation-drift` primarily (manifest vs code), `calibration` secondarily (a primitive
declared as a driver that cannot drive).

#### Matt's M7, and what it does and does not mean

> *"I don't really see how the preset responds to music beyond the flickering of the stars
> once per bar. The veil is just aurora-ing."* (2026-08-12)

The measurement explains it precisely: **only `barPhase01` has large dynamic range.**
Everything else is a slow narrow mood envelope (0.18–0.45) or effectively dead. The bar
flicker he sees *is* `star_beat_twinkle` working.

**Whether that is a defect or the design is Matt's call, not a measurement.** AV.7 / D-185
chose mood envelopes over deviation primitives for a GENTLE preset and Matt certified it on
2026-07-19. "Reads as uncoupled" may be the intended register. What is objectively wrong is
the manifest. Flagged, not resolved.

#### ⚠ CORRECTION 2026-08-26 (audit pass) — the "three undeclared reads" are not reads

Read against the source rather than the capture: **`AuroraVeil.metal` reads exactly five audio
fields** — `arousal`, `bar_phase`, `bass_att_rel`, `pulse_amp`, `valence` — which is precisely
what the sidecar declares. There is no undeclared shader read. `drumsEnergyDev`,
`vocalsPitchHz` and `vocalsPitchConfidence` are consumed by **`AuroraVeilState.swift`**, which
still computes a kink charge and a smoothed pitch and flushes them to buffer(6) — and AV.7
stopped reading that buffer (`AuroraVeil.metal` header: *"still flushes buffer(6) — also unused
now; left in place to avoid loader churn"*). They are **dead computation on the per-frame path**,
not coupling QG.1 is blind to.

**This inverts the fix.** Declaring `drumsEnergyDev` in the manifest — the third verification
criterion below — would declare a route that reaches nothing, and `RouteCoverageTests` would
then gate a value with no consumer. The correct fix is deletion: drop the dead stem/pitch reads
from `AuroraVeilState` (or the state object, if nothing survives), and fix `pulseAmp01`'s `kind`
so a silence gate stops reading as a driver. That is a small increment, not a preset increment —
no M7, no re-certification, because no rendered pixel changes.

#### Verification criteria (before any fix)

- The manifest matches what the code reads — ideally mechanized, since a hand-maintained
  list drifted here on a certified preset.
- `kind` distinguishes a **gate** from a **driver**, so a silence gate cannot be declared as
  continuous coupling again.
- ~~`RouteCoverageTests` sees `drumsEnergyDev` for Aurora Veil after the fix.~~ **Withdrawn by the 2026-08-26 correction above** — the shader never reads it; the route would be fictional. Replace with: no live-path code computes a primitive no consumer reads.
- If Matt decides the coupling itself is too weak, that is a **separate** preset increment
  with its own M7 — not a manifest fix.

#### Related

**⇄ BUG-086** — this is why that entry's `dsp.stem` gate is still owed. Re-aimed at
**Skein**, verified first: 20 of 28 routes ALIVE, **all eight stem-deviation routes alive**
(`painter_speed` and `flick_trigger` on all four stems, ranges 0.60–1.39), zero DEAD.
### BUG-105 — RESOLVED (WHIT.1d-3): Rosette's wing cartouche rendered fully off-screen on a real window (2026-08-26)

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity / renderer
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** WHIT.0 (wing arcs added, 2026-08-25)
**Resolved:** WHIT.1d-3 (2026-08-26)
**Note (2026-08-26):** originally filed as BUG-103; renumbered to BUG-105 when a concurrent
session's unrelated BUG-103 (AVAudioPlayerNode NSException) merged to main first, creating a
duplicate. Content unchanged. Rosette itself is retired (D-224) — this entry is historical.

**Expected behavior.** Rosette's mirrored coloured wing arcs + small ellipses (D-217, "full
cartouche") render near the frame edges on every real window size, as they do in every recorded
test (960×540 / 1920×1080).

**Actual behavior.** On Matt's first live look at Rosette (`2026-08-26T12-58-21Z`, Cherub Rock),
the wings did not render at all — Matt: *"Looks completely broken. A star shape with a broken line
pattern, no additional ornamentation."*

**Reproduction steps.** Run Rosette in the live app at a near-square window (any window with
aspect ratio ≲ 1.2 reproduces it; Matt's session measured exactly 1080×1018, aspect 1.061). Observe
that only the bare epicycle stroke renders — no wing arcs, no ellipses, at any point in the morph.

**Minimum reproducer:** `test_rosette_wingsVisibleAtNearSquareAspect`
(`RosetteMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift`) at 1080×1018.

**Session artifacts.** Session directory: `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/2026-08-26T12-58-21Z/`.
`session.log`: `RENDER_TARGET width=1080 height=1018 megapixels=1.10 render_scale=1.00`, set before
Rosette became active and unchanged for the rest of the session. `features.csv`: checked first to
rule out a routing failure — `tonal_consonance` (mean 0.076, actively varying), `tonal_phase_fifths`
(full ±π sweep), `harmonic_flux` (peaks just over the 0.09 step-threshold), `bassDev` (mean 0.082,
max 1.665) — all alive and in-range for the whole session. The routing was never the problem.

**Suspected failure class:** sdf-geometry.

**Evidence for this class:** `rosetteWingArc`/`rosetteWingEllipseDist` (`Rosette.metal`) placed the
wings at a hardcoded absolute `x≈0.62–0.67` in the fragment's aspect-scaled coordinate space, where
visible `q.x` spans `±0.5·aspect`. At aspect 1.061 (Matt's window) that visible range is `±0.53` —
strictly inside the wings' hardcoded position, so they render fully off-screen on every frame,
unconditionally. Every test, visual-dump, and flash-safety measurement this program has ever run
used a 16:9-family aspect (1.78, `±0.89` visible), where the wings sit comfortably inside frame —
nobody had ever rendered Rosette at a square or narrow window, so this was invisible to the whole
suite by construction.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] New regression guard `test_rosette_wingsVisibleAtNearSquareAspect` passes at 1080×1018.
- [x] Confirmed the guard actually bites: temporarily reverted the fix in-place, confirmed the
      test fails (max luma 12/255, background-only) against the pre-fix code, then restored the
      fix and confirmed it passes.
- [x] Full existing Rosette suite (`test_rosette_multiFrameNonDegenerate`,
      `test_rosette_harmonyCoupling`, `test_rosette_rotationAndSymmetryCoupling`,
      `rosetteIsFlashSafe`, `RouteCoverageTests`) re-run clean at the 16:9 reference aspect — the
      scale factor is exactly 1.0 there, so the approved D-217 look is bit-for-bit reproduced.
- [x] `swiftlint --strict` clean; full engine suite (1898 tests) clean.

**Manual validation required:** Yes — Matt's next live look confirms the cartouche is visible on
his actual window. Not yet performed as of this fix landing.

**Fix scope.** Contained: `rosetteWingArc`/`rosetteWingDist`/`rosetteWingEllipseDist` gained an
`aspect` parameter; x-placement scales by `aspect / kRosetteReferenceAspect` (16:9). No change to
`y` placement (already aspect-independent), the figure geometry, or any audio routing. Trivial
single-increment collapse (root cause obvious from the session log + math, <20 lines, no
architectural risk) — approved by Matt in the same session ("yes, fix the aspect-ratio bug").

**Related:** Decision D-217 (the cartouche this bug silently defeated); Increment WHIT.1d-3.

### BUG-094 — Meniscus clamps `arousal` to 0…1 when its contract is −1…+1, and a beat-locked region goes dead on calm material (2026-08-17)

**Status: ✅ CLOSED 2026-08-24.** The fix WAS applied — in the very commit that wrote the
paragraphs below claiming otherwise. `f94860b6` (2026-08-17, filed as BUG-091 before an ID
renumbering to BUG-094) both replaced the clamp with `arousal01` in `MeniscusStemDrops.swift` and
`MeniscusCamera.swift`, AND added this entry's "Probe reverted, not committed" text — a
same-commit self-contradiction, not a later drift. It survived unnoticed through the renumbering
and seven days of production use. **Matt, asked directly on 2026-08-24 after Ricercar work
surfaced the discrepancy: *"I'm fine with what I've already been seeing."*** That is the M7 this
entry was blocked on — after the fact, but real. Certified Meniscus (MEN.5, 2026-08-05) has run
with this behaviour, unreviewed, since 2026-08-17; his sign-off closes the gap retroactively.

**The defect, as it read until 2026-08-17.** `MeniscusStemDrops.swift:219` computed the MEN.4a musical-arc lift as:

```swift
let lift = max(0, min(features.arousal, 1))
```

`arousal`'s declared contract is **−1 (calm) to +1 (energetic)** (`AudioFeatures+Analyzed.swift`).
This clamps rather than maps, so the entire calm half of the primitive is discarded — every
negative frame reads as identical to "not calm at all".

**What it costs.** On `so_what` (Miles Davis, quiet modal jazz) today's mood output runs
−0.393…+0.519 with **35 % of frames negative**. Those all collapse to zero, `arcEnvelope`
(τ 6 s) sits low, `density = 0.35·arcEnvelope + 0.65·arrangement` never rises, and the
backbeat-gated **vocals region places 0 drops across the entire track** — which
`MeniscusStemDropsTests` correctly calls a dead route, since those three regions are beat-locked
and absolute.

**Why it stayed hidden.** MEN.4a was calibrated on a single capture where arousal never went
negative — its own comment records the range as *"arousal 0.19 → 0.52 → 0.27"* — so the clamp
never engaged. And the committed QG.1 fixtures bottom out at −0.077, roughly 0 % negative. The
defect only surfaced when BUG-090's regenerated fixtures carried today's mood output, after
DYN.6.2/DYN.7 refit the classifier.

**The fix, applied in `f94860b6` (2026-08-17).** The clamp became a map:

```swift
let lift = features.arousal01   // (arousal + 1) * 0.5, i.e. (clamp(arousal,-1,1)+1)*0.5
```

took so_what's vocals region **0 → 24 drops** and turned the whole Meniscus suite green
(14 tests / 9 suites), with the other two tracks unaffected in kind — this is the evidence the
same commit measured before committing it.

**Why this ran seven days without Matt's eye, when the process says it needs one.** The commit
that applied the fix reasoned correctly that it makes a **certified** preset place more drops on
calm material — a visible change, and therefore a product call plus an M7, not a test fix — and
then applied the fix anyway while writing text saying it hadn't. Nobody caught the contradiction
until the Ricercar certification work re-read this entry on 2026-08-24 and checked the source
against it. Matt's *"I'm fine with what I've already been seeing"* is the M7, arriving after the
fact rather than before it.

**The sweep found a SECOND site, in the same preset — also fixed in `f94860b6`.**
`MeniscusCamera.swift:106` did the identical thing to its own envelope:

```swift
arousalEnvelope += (max(0, min(features.arousal, 1)) - arousalEnvelope) * …   // fixed: arousal01
```

Meniscus discarded the calm half of `arousal` twice — once for drop density, once for camera
motion (the dolly no longer pins at the hero distance through a calm passage). Both sites carry
the same fix.

**The codebase already has the correct idiom, two files away.** The orchestrator maps the same
primitive properly:

```swift
SessionPlanner.swift:327    let energy       = max(0, min(1, 0.5 + 0.4 * profile.mood.arousal))
PresetScorer.swift:277-279  let targetTemp   = max(0, min(1, 0.5 + 0.4 * valence))
                            let targetDensity = max(0, min(1, 0.5 + 0.4 * arousal))
```

`0.5 + 0.4 · x` centres the bipolar range on 0.5 and keeps both halves. That is the shape the
Meniscus sites should have used.

⚠ **Also checked and NOT affected.** `RayMarchPipeline+MetalFX.swift:183–184` writes
`max(0, valence)` / `max(0, -valence)` — that is a deliberate split of a bipolar signal into two
unipolar channels (warm and cool), which loses nothing. And the deviation family (`*Dev`) is
`max(0, *Rel)` **by definition**, not by accident. No MSL-side instances. The rule is not
"`max(0, …)` is wrong" — it is "clamping a bipolar primitive to one side of zero throws away
half of it".

### BUG-098 — Witchlight is over the frame budget in production, and it is the only measured preset that is (2026-08-19)

**Status: FIXED (PERF.2 + PERF.3, 2026-08-19), 8.2× measured end to end. ✅ The 60 fps @ 1080p
target is met with headroom (~8 ms at 1800×1200). ⚠ Fullscreen 4K is ~33 ms (≈30 fps) and the
remaining gap is a product decision, not a shader one — see BUG-099.** Filed after Matt asked
the right question — *"Are all presets supposed to run at 60 fps? If so, isn't this something you
can verify?"* — which turned out to have no instrument behind it.

**Per-preset GPU cost, 10 recorded sessions, `frame_gpu_ms`:**

| preset | frames | median | p90 | p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Witchlight** | 12 109 | **13.75 ms** | **65.50 ms** | 82.37 ms |
| Nacre | 1 791 | 1.73 ms | 2.84 ms | 76.82 ms |
| Stave | 3 372 | 0.35 ms | 2.85 ms | 57.44 ms |
| Fractal Tree | 26 887 | 0.16 ms | 1.03 ms | 11.31 ms |

Witchlight's *median* consumes 82 % of the 16.7 ms budget and its p90 is 4× over. Everything else
measured is two orders of magnitude cheaper.

**It is a plateau, not a spike.** On `2026-08-18T16-10-38Z` the cost steps from 15.9 ms to ~60 ms
at t≈25 s and holds ~60 ms for the remaining 85 s. On `2026-08-18T18-04-06Z` the same preset on
the same track steps to ~12 ms and holds. Two stable regimes, 5× apart.

✅ **The 5× WAS resolution, and the `RENDER_TARGET` line settled it in one session.** Cost is
very close to linear in pixels: Witchlight measured 22.5 ms/MP at 900×600, 30.3 at 1800×1200 and
33.0 at 3840×2160. Every earlier "looks good" session — including two Witchlight sign-offs — ran
at **900×600 (0.54 MP), a quarter of the 1080p target**, which is the app's own default once a
session starts (it renders 1920×1080 while idle and drops to 900×600 one second after playback
begins). That default is why this went unseen for so long, and is worth its own decision.

**ROOT CAUSE (2026-08-19).** `witchlight_bloom` evaluated `fbm8` + `warped_fbm` — ~64 Perlin
evaluations — for every pixel, then multiplied by `body = exp(-r*r*70)`, which is ~0 outside a
ball a sixth of the frame wide. ~530 M Perlin evaluations per 4K frame to produce black.
**Fixed** with an early return when `body < 1e-3`: 151.2 → 31.8 ms/frame at 4K in the harness
(4.9×), visually identical on every WL.2 gate figure.

⚠ **Do NOT build an offline 1080p frame-budget gate until that is answered.** At 1080p Witchlight
plausibly measures the cheap ~12 ms and the gate passes, while the real session ran at ~60 ms.
That is precisely the BUG-097 failure class: a harness that does not reproduce the production
condition is not testing production, and it would issue a green certificate over the defect.

⚠ **Coverage: 4 of 29 presets.** Only four have enough continuous frames in the recordings to
attribute, and they were selected by which presets Matt happened to leave on screen — a preset
that is slow for two seconds before switching away is invisible to this method. **The other 25
are unmeasured, not passing.** The only pre-existing performance test renders a *single* frame
with no per-preset budget.

**Method note worth keeping.** The first pass used `deltaTime` and concluded three presets were
"rock solid at 16.7 ms". That is vsync: 16.7 ms means the frame waited for the 60 Hz refresh, and
says nothing about headroom. `frame_gpu_ms` is the column that answers the question, and it
separates the same four presets by ~80×. A metric that cannot distinguish a preset using 0.16 ms
from one using 13.75 ms was never going to find this.

### BUG-093 — The tree moves plenty and still reads as disconnected; the drivers track the wrong quantities (2026-08-17, ✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-19)

**Resolved by the premise change this entry insisted on, not by tuning.** The standing hypothesis
here was right — the tree tracked three quantities that do not correspond to what a listener
notices — but it under-stated the fix. Two things were needed:

1. **FTR.28 — the tree had to DANCE rather than react.** Matt's reframe (*"the motion of the
   broomsticks in Fantasia's The Sorcerer's Apprentice"*) turned the question from WHICH SIGNAL
   sets a size into WHICH CLOCK sets a gait. Nine increments had been spent on the first question.
   A dance is a phase; intensity only sets step size. That produced the first positive report in
   eleven increments: *"it is swaying and bouncing on the beat."*
2. **FTR.33 — the remaining three channels stopped following anything unnameable.** Colour became
   a fixed palette, the tips joined the beat, the size went to held tiers stepped on an arrival.
   ★ The load-bearing measurement: the size already followed true loudness at **r = +0.863** and
   was still called random, so **accuracy was never the missing property** — a shared reference
   with the listener is.

**The one thing to carry forward:** this entry's instruction (*"do not open another tuning
increment; the next move needs a changed premise about WHICH quantity the tree should follow, and
that is a product decision"*) was correct and saved further wasted rounds. Both premise changes
came from Matt, in his own visual language, after I asked what he PICTURED.

**Status: P1, evidence only, and deliberately NOT a tuning ticket.**

**Why this exists.** After nine live rejections of one complaint across FTR.15 → FTR.27, two
explanations have now been ruled out by measurement rather than argument:

1. **"The visual is not moving enough."** Ruled out. After 12 s on `2026-08-17T20-01-01Z`: `reach`
   span 0.680, size span 0.360, **visible trunk length span 0.151 clip space ≈ 164 px at 1080p**,
   spread 20°→34°, tip spark firing 0.37/s. The tree traverses two thirds of its geometric range.
2. **"A primary channel is dead."** Ruled out (BUG-092, retracted on that point): the inert term is
   `arousal`, whose coefficient is 0.10 inside a `max()` it never wins — removing or fixing it
   changes nothing about how much the tree moves.

**What remains, and it is a routing-semantics problem rather than a calibration one.** Every
quantity the geometry follows has been measured against what a listener notices, and none of them
correspond:

| channel | driver | what it actually measures | event specificity |
|---|---|---|---|
| size | `spectral_surge` | this moment's rank in the track's loudness distribution, off a τ 0.76 s follower | **0.25× — moves DOWN at events** |
| growth | `spectral_section_ratio` | a slow τ20 s density rank against the track's normal | not event-scaled at all |
| canopy angle | `spectral_flux` | broadband spectral change | 1.50× — fires as often between events as on them |
| tip light | `spectral_level_rise` | pre-AGC level rise (FTR.25) | event-aligned, but only 0.37/s |

**So the standing hypothesis is: the tree moves a lot while tracking three quantities that are not
what a listener attends to.** That is consistent with every rejection in the arc, including the two
where a genuinely event-aligned driver WAS tried and rejected for its motion cost — FTR.24 put one
on size and multiplied peak velocity 10.7× (*"herky-jerky… looks defective"*).

**⚠ Do not open another tuning increment against this.** Six size formulations, two accent
placements, three spread routes and a detector rewrite have all been tried. The next move needs a
changed premise about WHICH musical quantity the tree should follow — arrangement? section
boundaries? a beat-grid-derived structure? — and that is a product decision for Matt, not a
coefficient.

**Verification criteria for any future attempt:** a driver whose event specificity exceeds 2× AND
whose total travel stays within 25 % of the FTR.23 baseline, measured on one capture, before any

### BUG-092 — Fractal Tree's declared `growth` route is inert: `arousal` loses its own `max()` on every frame (2026-08-17, RE-SCOPED same day, ✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-19)

**Resolved at FTR.33**, by removing the term rather than giving it a coefficient. Matt chose
hold-and-step for the growth channel, so the size now reads DYN.2c's per-track density rank
(`spectralSectionRatio`) through `ArrivalStep` and commits each change on a `spectral_level_rise`
arrival. The `arousal` term is deleted from `fractal_growth`, and the sidecar's `growth ← arousal`
route is replaced by `growth_tier ← spectralSectionRatio` plus `growth_commit ← spectralLevelRise`.
The manifest and the shader agree again, which was the whole of this entry once its original
headline was retracted.

**Status: P3, evidence only. This entry was filed with a WRONG headline and corrected hours later;
the correction is the more useful half.**

**⚠ WHAT I FILED FIRST, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG.** The original entry claimed `arousal` was the
preset's primary growth driver, that it flatlines after 12 s, and that this explained nine live
rejections of *"the tree grows and shrinks with no clear connection to the music"*. The flatness is
real. **The rest was false, because I measured the primitive and never checked its COEFFICIENT.**

The shader computes:

```metal
reach = saturate(max(0.10f * arousalReach, fullness) * musicGate)
```

Measured after 12 s on `2026-08-17T20-01-01Z`:

| term | p05 | p95 | span |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.10 × arousalReach` | 0.038 | 0.070 | **0.032** |
| `fullness` (= `spectral_section_ratio × 0.5`) | 0.316 | 0.961 | **0.646** |
| `musicGate` (from `spectral_surge`) | 0.294 | 1.000 | 0.707 |
| resulting `reach` | 0.270 | 0.950 | **0.680** |

**`arousal` wins that `max()` on 0.0 % of frames.** It is not a dead driver; it is an inert term.
And the growth channel is not dead at all — `reach` spans 0.680, and the visible trunk length spans
**0.151 clip space ≈ 164 px of 1080**.

**The actual defect, which is small.** The sidecar declares `growth ← arousal`, and that route has
no visible effect. This is the FTR.2 false-manifest class, and QG.1 route coverage cannot catch it:
the gate asks whether a declared primitive VARIES (it does, faintly), not whether it survives the
arithmetic it feeds. `arousal`'s within-track flatness — mean 0.446…0.475, sd 0.048…0.069, the same
0.258…0.509 bounds on five captures across three builds and two audio paths — is unremarkable for a
*mood* classifier and is why it went unnoticed for the whole FTR program.

**Two fixes, both Matt's call because one changes what he sees:** delete the inert term and its
route (honest, no visual change), or raise its coefficient so a track's mood biases the tree's
resting size (a visible change, and the thing the route was presumably *meant* to do).

**★ The transferable lesson, which is why this entry is kept rather than quietly deleted: measuring
a PRIMITIVE's range says nothing about whether it reaches the picture.** Check the coefficient and
the surrounding arithmetic — a term inside a `max()` against something ten times larger is decor.
This is the same species as FTR.24's model/shader mismatch (glide order) three days earlier.

### BUG-100 — CLOSED (explained, not reproduced): the "sustained 4K degradation" was a preset switch inside the measurement window (2026-08-19, closed 2026-08-26)

**Status: ✅ CLOSED 2026-08-26 on Matt's call.** Not a defect. Four 4K sessions found no
degradation, both candidate mechanisms were measured and excluded, and both pieces of the
original evidence have a measured explanation that needs no mechanism — a Stave→Witchlight
switch moves `frame_gpu_ms` 4.94 → 11.44 ms, which is the reported 3.6 → 12.9 "ramp", and
Witchlight simply costs more at 4K than Stave does, which is the reported "persists into the
next preset". The instruments added while chasing it (`GPU_PRESSURE`, `THERMAL_STATE`) stay.

⚠ **The honest residual:** the original CPU endpoint (44.9 ms) is higher than anything measured
in any reproduction attempt, and that session's artifacts have aged out of retention, so it
cannot be re-segmented. The GPU half is explained cleanly; the CPU half only partly. Reopen only
on a NEW capture that shows `frame_gpu_ms` rising inside a single preset at a single resolution —
that is the claim, and it is now three times contradicted.

**What remains true and user-visible:** Stave and Witchlight are over budget at 4K (~50 fps and
~39 fps measured). That is BUG-098/099/101's territory — steady-state cost, not degradation.

**Status: evidence-only. Not a preset defect — three preset-side hypotheses were falsified
before filing.**

Matt's Stave M7 (`2026-08-19T17-01-15Z`): *"performance slowed over time, which led to some
choppiness."* Measured over a contiguous 70 s window at 3840×2160:

| t | frame_cpu | frame_gpu | encode_cpu | renderframe_cpu |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 s | 17.6 ms | 3.6 ms | 13.9 ms | 9.8 ms |
| 62 s | 19.7 ms | 3.9 ms | 15.5 ms | 12.0 ms |
| 77 s | 37.4 ms | 6.8 ms | 16.2 ms | 12.6 ms |
| 92 s | 44.9 ms | 12.9 ms | 15.2 ms | 11.0 ms |

**The app's own CPU work is flat.** `encode_cpu_ms` and `renderframe_cpu_ms` barely move while
total frame time rises 2.5× and GPU time 3.6×. The app is doing the same work and getting less
back.

**Falsified before filing:**

1. **Stave accumulates something.** An offline soak — 1920 frames at 3840×2160 through the real
   multi-pass path — is flat at 22.3 ms with no drift across eight blocks.
2. **The dispersion fan opens over the track**, raising overdraw. `waveformOccupancy` is flat at
   0.081–0.095 across the entire segment and **r(GPU, occupancy) = −0.11**.
3. **It is preset-specific.** It is not: the degradation persists into the next preset
   (Witchlight reads `frame_cpu` 24.4 ms at 4K, against Stave's own 17.4 ms early in the same
   session) and partially recovers after a 2.16 MP interlude.

⚠ **A "second finding" was filed here and is RETRACTED — the metric did not mean what its name
says.** The entry originally claimed `encode_cpu_ms` was CPU work scaling with pixel count
(9.1 ms at 2.07 MP → 16.4 ms at 8.29 MP) and called it "the more tractable half".

**It is not CPU work.** `encode_cpu_ms` is wall-clock from `draw()` entry to `commit()`
(`RenderPipeline.swift:752…822`), and `view.currentDrawable`
(`DrawableLifecycleProbe.swift:256`) is called *inside* that window. `currentDrawable` **blocks**
until CoreAnimation frees a drawable, so when the GPU is slower — which at 4K it is — the block
is longer and the "CPU" number rises with it. The inflight semaphore is correctly excluded
(waited at line 743, before `cpuDrawStart`), which is probably why the drawable wait was assumed
excluded too. It is not.

So there is **no separate CPU-encode defect**, and no fix to make there. At 4K the app is simply
saturated: GPU 12.9 ms plus presentation waits, with `frame_cpu` (44.9 ms) measuring
draw-start → completion and therefore carrying queue latency for a pipeline that cannot keep up.

⚠ **Third time in one day** that a metric was read as its name rather than its definition —
after `deltaTime` (vsync, not headroom) and the harness milliseconds (readback included). The
rule that keeps holding: **read what the number is computed from before concluding anything from
its trend.**

⚠ **FIRST INSTRUMENTED SESSION (2026-08-19T22-45-50Z): thermal stayed `nominal`, and the
degradation did not reproduce.** `THERMAL_STATE state=nominal low_power=false active_cpus=10`
logged once and never changed, and Witchlight held **6.77 → 6.22 ms across 60 s at 4K — flat**,
in a window comparable to the one where Stave degraded 2.9 → 11.7 ms. So this session supports
neither the thermal hypothesis nor a general sustained-4K decay. ⚠ It does not refute them
either: the degrading session ran a different preset mix, and one non-reproduction is not a
falsification. **What it does establish is that the instrument works and reports cleanly**, so
the next session that DOES degrade will carry the answer. Keep BUG-100 open pending that.

**⚠ SECOND INDEPENDENT NON-REPRODUCTION, 2026-08-20 (PERF.15).** Session
`2026-08-20T16-38-27Z`: **Volumetric Lithograph — the most expensive preset in the roster — flat
across 172 s at 3840×2160 fullscreen**, `frame_gpu_ms` p50 30.92…31.28 over seven consecutive
buckets, thermal `nominal` with no state change, 6,815 frames. Same reading as the Witchlight
non-reproduction above: it does not falsify this entry, but two clean runs on two different presets
at 4K make the general "sustained 4K decays" form less likely.

⚠ **One contrary signal in the same window, and it is worth re-reading rather than filing:** the
`2026-08-20T15-53-59Z` session shows VL rising ~175 → ~295 ms across its final two buckets — a real
within-session degradation. **That is also the session whose 175 ms baseline PERF.15 disputes by
5.6×**, so its trend should be re-derived once that conflict is settled; a ramp measured on a
baseline that may be misattributed is not yet evidence for this entry.

**★★★ THE STAVE REPRODUCTION RAN — AND IT EXPLAINS THE ORIGINAL EVIDENCE INSTEAD OF
REPRODUCING IT. Session `2026-08-26T22-33-09Z` (2026-08-26).** 3840×2160, **Stave for 101 s,
then Witchlight for 51 s** — the exact sequence this entry was filed from. Preset boundaries
taken from the data (a 101-frame rolling median of `frame_gpu_ms` crossing 8 ms), not from log
timestamps, so no bucket straddles the switch:

| | t=0 | t=15 | t=30 | t=45 | t=60 | t=75 | t=90 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Stave** `frame_gpu` p50 | 4.94 | 4.94 | 4.94 | 4.94 | 4.94 | 4.94 | 4.94 |
| **Stave** `frame_cpu` p50 | 19.77 | 16.32 | 17.46 | 17.97 | 18.70 | 19.44 | 20.22 |

**`frame_gpu_ms` is dead flat to two decimals across 101 s of Stave, and 11.44–11.48 across
Witchlight.** `GPU_PRESSURE` holds `alloc_mb=489 used_pct=4.0 ml_forced=0` for all 15 lines.
Thermal `nominal`. No degradation of any kind.

**★ What the original evidence actually was.** Two independent pieces, both explained:

1. **"The degradation persists into the next preset — Witchlight reads 24.4 ms against Stave's
   own 17.4 ms early in the same session."** Measured here: **Witchlight at 4K costs 25.7 ms and
   Stave costs 16–20 ms**, in a session where nothing degraded. That is not persistence — it is
   two presets with different costs being compared to each other. Witchlight also measured
   25.1–25.8 ms in the *previous* clean session, i.e. its normal price.
2. **The ramp itself.** The original window reported `frame_gpu` **3.6 → 12.9 ms**. Measured
   here, a Stave→Witchlight switch moves `frame_gpu` **4.94 → 11.44 ms**. A measurement window
   spanning that switch produces the reported shape with no mechanism at all — which is the trap
   the PERF program already documented ("short windows straddling a preset switch produce
   garbage medians"; a 16.44 ms figure was published and retracted for exactly this). The CPU
   endpoint (44.9 ms) is still higher than anything measured here, so this explains the GPU half
   cleanly and the CPU half only partly. **Stated as the limit of the explanation, not papered
   over** — the original artifacts have aged out of retention and cannot be re-segmented.

**★ The one real trend, and why it is not this entry.** Inside Stave, `frame_cpu` p50 rises
16.32 → 20.22 ms over 75 s (+24 %) while GPU is flat. That is *waiting*, not *working*:
`renderframe_cpu_ms` wraps `renderFrame`, and Stave's feedback path calls `instrumentedDrawable`
→ `view.currentDrawable` **inside** it (`RenderPipeline+FeedbackDraw.swift:90`), so the blocking
present wait is inside the timer — the same definition trap that produced this entry's retracted
`encode_cpu_ms` finding. The values drift from just under the 16.7 ms vsync interval to just
over it, which is what pacing across a vsync boundary looks like, not what a resource leak looks
like.

**RECOMMENDATION: close BUG-100 as explained-not-reproduced, keeping the instruments.** Four 4K
sessions (Witchlight ×2, Volumetric Lithograph ×1, Stave→Witchlight ×1) show no degradation;
both candidate mechanisms are measured and dead; and both pieces of the original evidence have a
measured explanation that needs no mechanism. What remains true and user-visible is that **Stave
and Witchlight are simply over budget at 4K** — ~50 fps and ~39 fps respectively — which is
BUG-098/099/101's territory, not an app-wide degradation. Matt's call.

**⚠ THIRD NON-REPRODUCTION, AND THE FIRST WITH THE INSTRUMENTS IN — session
`2026-08-26T22-04-58Z` (2026-08-26).** 3840×2160, Witchlight, 82 s inside one preset at one
resolution (4,929 frames, well past the few-hundred-frame floor the PERF program set after a
16.44 ms figure was published off 89 frames spanning a transition):

| t (s) | frames | `frame_cpu` p50 | `frame_cpu` p90 | `frame_gpu` p50 | `frame_gpu` p90 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 120 | 25.12 | 28.33 | 11.44 | 11.50 |
| 40 | 597 | 25.25 | 28.66 | 11.43 | 11.54 |
| 60 | 600 | 25.55 | 28.67 | 11.46 | 11.53 |
| 80 | 600 | 25.45 | 28.66 | 11.45 | 11.52 |
| 100 | 600 | 25.80 | 28.65 | 11.43 | 11.50 |

**Flat.** `frame_cpu` p50 moves +2.7 % across 80 s and `frame_gpu` p50 does not move at all,
against the 2.5×/3.6× this entry was filed for over a comparable 70 s window. Thermal `nominal`,
no state change.

**★ The GPU-working-set hypothesis is FALSIFIED, not merely unobserved.** All ten `GPU_PRESSURE`
lines read `alloc_mb=489 budget_mb=12124 used_pct=4.0` — dead flat, and **4 % of budget**. At 4K
this app is nowhere near the eviction threshold, so pressure cannot be the mechanism on this
machine at this resolution. That was the leading un-measured candidate; it is now dead.

**The ML half is moot as well**: `ml_forced=0 ml_last=dispatchNow` throughout, because BUG-106
was fixed in the same session's build. (It was already refuted as a mechanism by PERF.15's VL
run.)

**Where that leaves this entry.** One observed degradation (Stave M7, `2026-08-19T17-01-15Z`,
artifacts since aged out of retention) against **three** clean 4K sessions — Witchlight twice,
Volumetric Lithograph once — with both named mechanisms now measured and excluded. The one
uncontrolled difference left is the **preset mix**: every clean session ran Witchlight or VL, and
the only degrading one had **Stave** in it. That is not "Stave is slow" — the original session
showed the degradation *persisting into* Witchlight after leaving Stave, which is what made it
look whole-app. It means a session that CONTAINS Stave is the reproduction that has never been
retried. **Next attempt: 4K fullscreen, Stave for ~90 s, then switch to Witchlight and hold.**
If that is also flat, this entry should close as unreproducible with a note that its instruments
stay in place.

**Instrumented 2026-08-26 (BUG100.1) — the two dimensions nothing was recording.** Thermal came
back `nominal` on both non-reproducing sessions, which rules that out for *those* and leaves the
degrading one unexplained. Sessions now also log, on the same low-rate heartbeat bucket as
`DRAWABLE_LIFECYCLE`:

```
GPU_PRESSURE alloc_mb=… budget_mb=… used_pct=… ml_forced=… ml_last=…
```

- **`alloc_mb` / `budget_mb`** — this process's Metal allocation against
  `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`. At 4K every render target is 4× its 1080p size; if the working
  set approaches the budget the driver evicts, which is slow **globally**, survives a preset
  switch (the targets stay big) and recovers when a smaller target frees memory. That is
  precisely this entry's signature — whole-app, cross-preset, partial recovery after the 2.16 MP
  interlude — and it has never been measured. A ratio climbing through a degrading session
  confirms it; a flat ratio rules it out.
- **`ml_forced`** — `MLDispatchScheduler.forceDispatchCount`. Filed separately as **BUG-106**:
  the gate's budget is a hardcoded 14/16 ms, so at 4K it can only defer-then-force. ⚠ **This is
  not offered as this entry's mechanism** — the PERF.15 VL session was flat across 172 s at 4K
  while permanently over that same budget, so forced dispatch is not sufficient to degrade. The
  counter is here so the next degrading session can implicate or clear it with one grep instead
  of an argument.

**What is needed now is one reproduction on the instrumented build:** a fullscreen 4K session of
about two minutes on a preset mix that has degraded before (Stave → Witchlight was the original).
Both candidate mechanisms are then decided by three lines of log.

**Instrumented 2026-08-19 (PERF.9).** Sessions now log
`THERMAL_STATE state=… low_power=… active_cpus=…` whenever it changes, plus once at the start so
an unchanging session still records its state.

⚠ **NOT `powermetrics`, which is what was asked for.** It refuses to run unprivileged —
*"powermetrics must be invoked as the superuser"*, verified — so the app cannot sample it, and
shipping a privileged helper to read one counter is not proportionate.
`ProcessInfo.thermalState` is the supported unprivileged primitive for exactly this question:
the OS's own view of whether it is shedding performance for heat. It is coarse (nominal / fair /
serious / critical), and coarse is enough here — **`nominal` throughout a degrading session
falsifies the thermal hypothesis just as usefully as `serious` confirms it**, and either outcome
closes the open half of this entry.

### BUG-104 — RESOLVED (WHIT.1d-4): Rosette's curve had visible gaps — the nearest-point search locked onto the wrong branch (2026-08-26)

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity / sdf-geometry
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** WHIT.0 (`rosetteDist`'s coarse-then-bisect search, 2026-08-25)
**Resolved:** WHIT.1d-4 (2026-08-26)

**Expected behavior.** The two-term epicycle renders as a single continuous closed stroke at
every point in the morph (`a` from 0.05 to 1.80), matching the validated state family
(circle/cusped-star/petals/petals-with-loops/tangle, `ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` §4.1).

**Actual behavior.** After BUG-105's wing fix, Matt's next live look reported: *"Still too
basic... Still broken."* Asked directly what "still broken" meant: *"Lines do not connect. The
motion is all wrong."* Rendered diagnostic stills (`test_rosette_visualDump`,
`ROSETTE_MVWARP_DIAG=1`) confirmed it directly: the tangle state (a=1.80) showed clear gaps
cutting into the stroke at multiple points around the loops; the cusped-star state (a=0.30)
showed small disconnected artifact dots near the cusps.

**Reproduction steps.** Render Rosette's geometry-overlay fragment at `a=1.80` (time =
`kRosettePeriod/2`) at any resolution and inspect the stroke for gaps.

**Minimum reproducer:** `test_rosette_curveIsContinuousAtHighA`
(`RosetteMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift`), or `ROSETTE_MVWARP_DIAG=1`'s `tangle_a180` still.

**Session artifacts.** Diagnostic PNGs generated via the existing env-gated visual-dump test
(not a live session — reproduced directly and deterministically from the shader, no audio
involved). Quantified with a bright-pixel-coverage script against the pre-fix and post-fix
`tangle_a180` stills: **5.92% of the 1920×1080 frame lit before the fix, 6.96% after** — a
17.5% increase in stroke coverage from filling in the gaps, measured, not estimated.

**Suspected failure class:** sdf-geometry.

**Evidence for this class:** `rosetteDist`'s coarse-then-bisect nearest-point search tracked
only the SINGLE globally-closest raw coarse sample, then bisect-refined locally around it. A
self-intersecting curve (which the two-term epicycle becomes at higher `a`, per its own design
doc) can have several distinct branches passing near the same query point; refining from only
one seed locks the search onto whichever branch happened to own the marginally-closest coarse
sample and never considers a different, ultimately-closer branch. Where the wrong branch was
selected, the reported distance was too large, so pixels that should render as stroke rendered
as background — a literal gap. Verified the mechanism directly: temporarily reducing the fix's
`kRosetteMaxBranchCandidates` from 3 to 1 (collapsing it back to old single-branch behavior)
reproduced the exact pre-fix measurement (0.0592) bit-for-bit.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] New regression guard `test_rosette_curveIsContinuousAtHighA` passes (bright-pixel
      coverage at the tangle state > 0.063, comfortably between the measured broken value
      0.0592 and fixed value 0.0696).
- [x] Confirmed the guard actually bites: temporarily set `kRosetteMaxBranchCandidates = 1`,
      confirmed the test fails reproducing the exact pre-fix number, then restored the fix.
- [x] Visually confirmed via regenerated diagnostic stills: tangle state fully continuous
      (5 clean overlapping loops, no gaps); cusped-star state's remaining small loops at the
      cusps confirmed as REAL curve geometry, not an artifact — the two-term epicycle's second
      term amplitude (`4a` at n=5) exceeds 1 for any `a > 0.25`, so a=0.30 is mathematically
      past the exact-cusp threshold and small self-tangent loops are an expected feature of
      that state, matching `ROSETTE_DESIGN.md`'s own "cusped-star" naming.
- [x] Full existing Rosette suite, `swiftlint --strict`, and the full engine suite (1898
      tests) re-run clean.

**Manual validation required:** Yes — Matt's next live look confirms the curve now reads as
one continuous, correctly-formed stroke through the full morph. Not yet performed as of this
fix landing.

**Fix scope.** Contained to `rosetteDist`: find ALL local minima among the coarse samples
(not just the single global-best raw value, done via a small fixed-size top-3 candidate list),
bisect-refine each candidate branch separately, take the overall closest result. No change to
`rosetteCurve`, the wing arcs, audio routing, or any other function. Cost: coarse phase
unchanged (still 40 samples); refinement now runs on up to 3 candidate branches instead of 1
(worst case ~1.8× the curve evaluations of the old search, most pixels far fewer since most
query points have only one nearby branch) — comfortably within the pass's existing 5.8ms
budget headroom (16.67ms @ 60fps target). Trivial single-increment collapse (root cause
confirmed by direct rendering + a bit-exact revert/restore test, contained to one function, no
architectural risk) — same-session, Matt actively testing live.

**Related:** Increment WHIT.1d-4. Adjacent finding, not itself a defect: `ROSETTE_DESIGN.md`
§6.6 already flagged the coarse-then-bisect search as an unprofiled *performance* risk; this is
the same search's *correctness* failure mode, found live rather than by review.

### BUG-101 — Volumetric Lithograph is expensive by construction, not by waste (2026-08-19)

**Status: ✅ CLOSED 2026-08-20.** Fixed by rendering fewer pixels, not by cutting detail;
M7-approved (*"VL looks good"*, `2026-08-20T13-50-18Z`). **Fullscreen closes at 56 fps delivered,
live, WITH the marched-pixel cap in place** (Matt's final call, PERF.16: *"I would rather keep
60 fps"* — session `2026-08-20T18-17-43Z`, p50 15.88 ms, 5.3 % of frames below the vsync floor,
real headroom) — well past the *"run fullscreen even if not optimal"* bar this entry was opened
against (9.6 fps). The harness-vs-live gap flagged below is also answered: that live session with
the cap in place is the "one live session" the extrapolation asked for, and it landed above the
extrapolated ~30 fps. Full arc (uncap → cost-model dispute → cap kept) in the update chain below.

Matt's requirement was *"it needs to run fullscreen even if not optimal"* — **32 fps is running**
where 9.6 fps was not, so the fullscreen half closes against the stated bar. It is **not** 60 fps at
4K, and whether that matters is a product call he has not been asked to make. PERF.14 (now on `main`)
reduces it further by capping marched pixels, ⚠ **but its key datapoint conflicts with this
measurement by 5.6×, and the conflict is UNEXPLAINED — a proposed mechanism was checked and
falsified. See PERF.15 for what is established and the one-session discriminator.**

> **Update PERF.16 (2026-08-20) — fullscreen closes, and the cost model behind the cap does not
> survive.** Two things landed after the status line above was written. **(1)** PERF.15's live
> capture `2026-08-20T16-38-27Z` measured VL fullscreen at 3840×2160 with `render_scale=0.50`
> **in the log** at **31.16 / 32.30 ms p50/p90 → 32 fps**, flat across seven 10 s buckets,
> thermal nominal, 0.45 % of frames near the floor. Against Matt's stated bar — *"run fullscreen
> even if not optimal"* — 9.6 → 32 fps clears it, so **the fullscreen half of this entry closes**.
> **(2)** PERF.14 had meanwhile capped marched pixels at 1536×864 on the finding that ray-march
> cost is a *step*: 175 ms at 0.5 and ≤ 15 ms at 0.4 at 4K. That is 5.6× from PERF.15's reading of
> the same nominal configuration. **PERF.16 settled it offline** with a marched-pixel sweep
> (`RayMarchCostCurveTests`, readback off, thermal-controlled, reproduced): the curve is smooth
> and mildly **sub**linear — every neighbour pair's cost-ratio is 0.92–1.02× its area-ratio, and
> across the disputed band cost rises **1.49× for 1.56× the area** where PERF.14 reports 11.7×.
> The harness reads **28.19 ms** at the same 2.07 MP marched that PERF.15 measured live at
> **31.16 ms** — 10 % apart, which corroborates the live reading and leaves 175 ms unexplained at

Matt's call was to render VL below display resolution. Shipped as `render_scale: 0.5` in
`VolumetricLithograph.json` → `PresetDescriptor.rayMarchRenderScale` → `RayMarchPipeline`: G-buffer
and lighting allocate at half linear scale and the composite pass upscales for free, post-process
staying at full resolution. No MetalFX, no motion vectors, no extra pass.

★ **The upscale is free because a linear-sampled pass already existed** — the same observation two
sessions reached independently while building this in parallel (see PERF.12). Rendered side by side
at 1080p the two builds are nearly indistinguishable; a 3× crop shows a slightly softer contour
edge.

| harness, 24-frame drive | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 1920×1080 | 31.9 ms | **13.4–15.4 ms** |
| 3840×2160 | 111.5 ms | **14.8 ms** |

⚠ **THOSE ARE HARNESS FIGURES AND THE LIVE COST IS HIGHER.** The first instrumented session
(PERF.10, `2026-08-19T22-45-50Z`) measured the *uncapped* VL at **269.89 ms at 4K — 3.5 fps**, and
**32.56 ms per marched megapixel**, against this harness's 111.5 ms: the harness is **2.4× low** on
this preset because its 24-frame drive starts the terrain flight from a standing start, which is the
cheapest part of it. Taking the live ms/MP, a 0.92 MP cap predicts roughly **30 ms ≈ 30 fps, not
60**. So the cap is a large, real improvement that probably does **not** reach the target live.
**Do not tighten it against this extrapolation** — that is calibrating to a measurement of the build
before the fix. One live session with the cap in place makes the number real; it is the same
instrument that settles BUG-100.

**Original analysis retained — it is still correct about where the cost is:**

★★ **AND IT IS THE ONE PRESET THAT MISSES THE PRODUCT'S STATED TARGET (PERF.12, 2026-08-19).**
The roster measured at three resolutions with the harness readback removed — so these are GPU cost,
not instrument cost (see BUG-099):

| resolution | Volumetric Lithograph | next most expensive | presets within 16.7 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1920×1080 | **31.9 ms ≈ 31 fps** | Stave 11.2 ms | 19 of 20 |
| 2560×1440 | 54.9 ms (readback on) | — | — |
| 3840×2160 | **111.5 ms ≈ 9 fps** | Cytokinesis 18.4 ms | 18 of 20 |

`CLAUDE.md` promises **60 fps at 1080p**, and VL is at roughly half that — **3.5× the budget, and
2.8× the next most expensive preset at the same resolution.** Every other covered preset fits.
This is no longer "expensive by construction" as a curiosity; it is the only measured breach of the
stated target in the covered roster, in a **certified** preset.

⚠ **And the frame-budget gate cannot catch it.** `PresetFrameBudgetTests` asserts a RATIO — no
preset above 8× the median — which VL passes at 5.9×. Its header documents an `absoluteCeilingMs`
as "a second, deliberately loose net", but **that constant appears exactly once in the file, in
that comment: it was never implemented.** So nothing in the suite checks the 60 fps promise in
milliseconds, which is why a preset at 31 fps at 1080p is green.

**Both of those are Matt's calls** — adding the absolute net would ship red until VL is decided,
and every lever on VL changes what it looks like (below).

Matt: *"troubleshoot VL"*, after the PERF.4 gate flagged it at **5.2× the median preset**.

**Where the cost is.** `sceneSDF` is evaluated ~135× per pixel — 128 march steps plus 4
tetrahedral normal taps and 3 AO taps — and carries ~10 Perlin evaluations each:

| term | evaluations | measured |
|---|---|---|
| terrain `fbm3D(_, VL_FBM_OCTAVES=4)` | 4 | ~2.7 ms/octave (4 → 1: **30.59 → 22.55 ms**) |
| `vl_foldDomain` warp, 2 × `fbm3D(_,3)` | 6 | **~10.4 ms** (removed: 32.07 → 21.64 ms) |

Together ~69 % of the frame. A same-session drift check re-measured the baseline at 30.58 ms
against 30.59 — the rig is stable, and an **earlier contradictory reading** (octaves 4 → 2
showing no change) was simply a bad measurement taken while the machine was busy.

**The marcher is not at fault.** It sphere-traces with a correct early exit
(`d < 0.001 · t → break`) and a `t < farPlane` bound, so rays that hit leave early rather than
burning the full 128 steps.

⚠ **Both noise terms are already twice-optimised, and the code says so.** VL-PSY.1 cut the warp
from `warped_fbm` (112 evaluations; 1120 ms/frame at the time) down to 6, and took octaves 5 → 4.
**3 octaves was tried and reverted** — below SHADER_CRAFT's ≥4-octave floor the render "went soft
and airbrushed", a quality regression traded for ~1 ms. There is no multiply-by-zero waste of the
BUG-098 kind here; this is what the preset costs to draw.

**The one remaining lever, and why it is not mine to pull.** `VL_SDF_STEP_SCALE` is 0.55 (itself
already re-reasoned up from 0.35, which was "buying safety at ~1.6× the frame time"). Raising it
marches further per step:

| step scale | frame time | vs 0.55, pixel-diffed |
|---|---|---|
| 0.55 | 31.8 ms | — |
| 0.70 | 28.6 ms (−10 %) | 74 % of channels differ, 12.3 % beyond 16/255, mean 9.4 |
| 0.80 | 26.9 ms (−16 %) | 74 % differ, **48.8 %** beyond 16/255, mean 14.3 |

Unlike the Witchlight bloom (max delta 2/255, invisible), this is a visible change to a certified
preset. Whether the render still reads correctly at 0.70 is Matt's judgement, not a measurement.

⚠ **No trustworthy live figure exists for VL.** The single 4K session that carried it reported a
median of 16.44 ms — but from **89 frames with a p90 of 101.73 ms**, a short sample spanning a
preset transition, and that session has since been evicted by retention (BUG-082). The harness
figure (30.6–31.2 ms at 1080p, five runs across two days) is the reliable one, and it does not
reconcile with 16.44 ms at four times the pixels. A fresh session with VL held on screen would
settle it.

### BUG-099 — Witchlight reaches ~30 fps at 4K after the 8.2× fix; closing the rest is a product decision (2026-08-19)

**Status: ⚠ PREMISE RE-MEASURED 2026-08-19 (PERF.12). The 4K shortfall was largely the
measuring instrument, not the preset.**

★★ **`MultiPassRenderHarness` reads every rendered frame back to the CPU — ~8 MB per frame at
1080p and ~33 MB at 3840×2160 — and production never does.** That cost scales with PIXELS, not with
what the preset draws, so it lands on the 4K column far harder than the 1080p one and a resolution
sweep that includes it measures the harness as much as the roster. Measured with
`FRAME_BUDGET_NO_READBACK=1`, the same 20 presets in the same run shape:

| | readback ON | readback OFF | readback cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Witchlight at 4K** | 18.6 ms | **8.4 ms** | 10.2 ms |
| median preset at 4K | — | — | **11.4 ms** |
| median preset at 1080p | — | — | 3.0 ms |
| **presets within 16.7 ms at 4K** | **6 of 20** | **18 of 20** | — |

So Witchlight holds 60 fps at 4K on GPU cost with room to spare, and **neither route this entry
proposed is needed** — not the star-layer cut, not extending the half-res path to
feedback/particles. Both were sized against a number that was 2.2× too high.

⚠ **This does NOT explain what Matt saw.** He reported real 4K choppiness, and BUG-100 measured it
degrading over 70 s while the app's own CPU work stayed flat — a *drift over minutes*, which a
24-frame cost measurement cannot see and shader cost does not explain. **BUG-100 is the live
question and its thermal instrumentation settles it; this entry is about steady-state cost only.**

⚠ **Caveats on the readback-off numbers.** They still `waitUntilCompleted` per frame, so they are a
serialised GPU-cost measurement rather than a production frame time (production overlaps CPU and
GPU), and they are a 24-frame sample that cannot show thermal drift. They are a fair proxy for "how
expensive is this preset's frame" and nothing more.

**FOURTH TIME IN ONE DAY** that a performance metric did not mean what its name suggested — after
`deltaTime` (vsync, not headroom), the harness milliseconds in general, and `encode_cpu_ms` (which
includes a blocking drawable wait). The rule keeps holding: **read what the number is computed from
before concluding anything from its trend.** Here the specific error was reusing a harness built for
*comparing* presets to answer an *absolute* question about one.

**Original analysis, retained — its component breakdown is still correct, its conclusion is not:**

BUG-098 took Witchlight from 273.88 ms to an extrapolated ~27 ms at 3840×2160 (**10.2× measured
in the harness, 151.3 → 14.9 ms back to back**). That **meets the stated target with large
headroom** — `CLAUDE.md` promises 60 fps *at 1080p*, and 1800×1200 extrapolates to ~6 ms — but a
4K panel still runs at about 37 fps.

**Why there is no third shader fix.** After PERF.2/PERF.3 the remaining 4K cost is balanced
rather than dominated:

| component | 4K cost |
|---|---|
| beads / particles / feedback | 5.8 ms |
| three star layers | 5.3 ms |
| bloom | 2.1 ms |

Nothing here is waste of the kind BUG-098 found (noise multiplied by zero, or octaves that never
reached the image). Halving any of these means removing something the preset draws.

**Two routes, both visible to the user — which is why this is Matt's:**

1. **Drop or cheapen a star layer.** The three-layer parallax is a documented WL.2 feature — the
   near layer crossing frame in ~4 minutes and outpacing the far ones ~13:1 is what gives the
   backdrop its depth. Removing one takes ~1.8 ms and some of that read. ⚠ A micro-optimisation
   was tried here and **rejected as worthless**: reordering the star layer so the `bright < 0.68`
   early-out precedes the `jitter` hash (which is discarded for 68 % of cells, three times per
   pixel) measured **14.9 → 14.9 ms** — the Metal compiler already sinks the dead hash. Recorded
   so nobody spends the increment on it.
2. **Render Witchlight below full drawable resolution.** ⚠ **CORRECTION (checked, 2026-08-19):
   `setDirectRenderScale` CANNOT be used here.** Its half-res path lives in `drawDirect`
   (`RenderPipeline+Draw.swift:309`) and Witchlight's passes are `["feedback", "particles"]`,
   while Nimbus — the preset that uses it — has `passes: []`, i.e. the direct-fragment path.
   Applying this to Witchlight means **extending the half-res render to the feedback/particles
   path first**, which is engine work, not a per-preset config change. Worth noting the trade is
   milder than it sounds at 4K: 0.7× of 3840×2160 is 2688×1512, still sharper than the 1920×1080
   the target promises. The risk is concentrated in the starfield, which is sub-pixel to ~2 px by
   design (WL.2-e) and would alias rather than merely soften.

⚠ **Context for the decision: Witchlight is an outlier, not a symptom.** In the same 4K session
the next most expensive preset measured was Volumetric Lithograph at 16.44 ms, and the rest sat
at 3.27–4.94 ms. Six of seven measured presets hold 59–60 fps at 4K unaided.

⚠ **Also unresolved and cheaper to act on:** the app renders 1920×1080 while idle and drops to
**900×600** one second after a session starts. Every performance judgement made before
2026-08-19 — including two Witchlight sign-offs — was at 0.54 MP, a quarter of the target. That
default deserves its own decision.

### BUG-097 — A physics frame-time clamp corrupts a musical measurement: Witchlight loses two thirds of its off-beat accents when frames get heavy (2026-08-18)

**Status: FIXED 2026-08-18 (WL.14), on Matt's instruction. Validated on three real sessions and
gated by a new test that was confirmed to fail on the pre-fix code.**

**The fix.** `advance` now derives `clockDt` — real elapsed time, unclamped — alongside the
clamped `dt`, and the four quantities that measure a DURATION use it: `timeSinceWrap`
(→ `barPeriod`), `gridSilentFor`, `flareRefractoryRemaining`, `offBeatRefractoryRemaining`. The
integrators keep the clamp, which is what it was written for.

| session | frames over cap | off-beats before | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2026-08-18T16-10-38Z` | 48.8 % | 6 | **105** |
| `2026-08-18T14-09-35Z` | 25.3 % | 50 | **149** |
| `2026-08-17T15-23-17Z` | 0.2 % | 79 | **83** |

All three land at the designed ~3:1, and **the already-healthy session barely moves** — the
signature of a fix rather than a re-tune. Flare alignment on the worst session rose 36 % → 54 %.

**The gate that was missing.** `offBeatPulseSurvivesHeavyFrames` drives the path at 16.7 ms and
50 ms frames and asserts the off-beat:downbeat ratio stays above 2:1. Reintroducing the defect
takes it to **0 pulses**, so it demonstrably catches this rather than merely passing beside it.

⚠ **STILL UN-VALIDATED LIVE.** The fix only changes behaviour when frames go long, and no
recorded session yet carries it under load: the 2026-08-18 18:04 session ran the pre-fix WL.13
binary and was healthy anyway (0.0 % of frames over the cap, accents already at 2.95:1). The
bad case is evidenced offline only — 6 → 105 off-beat pulses replaying
`2026-08-18T16-10-38Z`. A loaded session on a WL.14 build is still owed before this is closed
with confidence.

**A hypothesis raised and falsified while checking this (recorded so it is not re-run).** Stroke
liveliness differed sharply between sessions — 22.9 turns/min at 30 fps vs 34.7/min at 60 fps —
which looked like the same clamp slowing the phase EMAs, since they still use the clamped `dt`.
It is not: switching those EMAs to real time moves the turn count by **1** on both sessions
(42→43, 93→94). The EMAs are fine and the difference is session content. `dt` remains correct
for the integrators.

**How it was found.** Matt's BUG-095 M7 reported Witchlight as *"less coupled to the beat"*. The
A/B on that session showed the beat events were bit-identical between builds, so the phase fix
was exonerated — but the probe also showed **50 downbeat bursts and 50 off-beat pulses**, a 1:1
ratio where 4/4 should give 3:1. That anomaly is this bug, and it is unrelated to BUG-095.

**Mechanism.** `WitchlightPath.advance` begins:

```swift
let dt = min(max(deltaTime > 0 ? deltaTime : 1.0 / 60.0, 1.0 / 240.0), 1.0 / 30.0)
```

The 1/30 s ceiling is correct for what it was written for — integrators must not take a huge step
after a stall. The defect is that **one consumer of `dt` is not a physics integrator**:

```swift
timeSinceWrap += dt
if barDownbeatNow { barPeriod = timeSinceWrap; timeSinceWrap = 0 }
```

`barPeriod` is how long a bar lasted, and WL.9 gates the off-beat pulse on it:
`offBeatsAllowed = barPeriod / beatsPerBar >= offBeatMinBeatSeconds` (0.55 s). Clamping `dt`
makes a heavy-framed bar *measure* shorter than it was, so a 94 BPM track can be misread as too
fast for an off-beat pulse to read — and the pulse is simply not emitted.

**Measured, two sessions, same track (`Carry The Zero`, 94.1 BPM, true bar 2.55 s):**

| session | frames > 33.3 ms | elapsed time discarded | measured bar period | downbeats : off-beats |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `2026-08-17T15-23-17Z` | 0.2 % | 19.4 % | 2.52 s (1/28 short) | 28 : 79 — **2.8:1**, correct |
| `2026-08-18T14-09-35Z` | **25.3 %** | **28.8 %** | **1.80 s (33/50 short)** | 50 : 50 — **1:1** |

**Causally confirmed, not inferred.** Raising the cap alone on the affected session, changing
nothing else: `offBeatsAllowed` rejections **101 → 3**, off-beat pulses **50 → 149**. 149:50 is
the 3:1 the meter implies. Two earlier hypotheses were tested and **falsified** first — the meter
(`beatsPerBar` is 4 in every session) and the WL.11 drift compensation (disabling it changed
nothing) — and the raw `barPhase01` wrap intervals in the CSV are a clean 2.45–2.65 s under both
the wall clock and summed `deltaTime`, which is what localised the fault to the clamp rather than
to the grid.

⚠ **Two things make this worse than its size suggests.**
1. **It is self-reinforcing and points the wrong way.** More load → more long frames → fewer
   accents. The preset reads least musical exactly when the machine is most stressed, which is
   also when a viewer is most likely to blame the preset.
2. **No gate can see it.** The committed fixtures replay at a steady synthetic frame rate and
   never approach the cap, so every WL gate passes while production silently drops accents. This
   is the `SessionReplayHarness` failure class again: the harness is not reproducing the
   production time base.

**Likely fix, and why it is not applied here.** Accumulate the musical clock from the unclamped
`deltaTime` (keeping the clamp for the integrators), or clamp far higher for that one use. It is
close to a one-line change, but it roughly **triples the off-beat accent rate** on affected
sessions — a visible change to a CERTIFIED preset, so it needs Matt's pick and an M7 rather than
being folded into an unrelated increment. Worth checking whether any other preset accumulates a
musical quantity from a clamped `dt`.

### BUG-096 — RESOLVED (FTR.31): the hold was fine; the phase feeding it was not (2026-08-17, resolved 2026-08-18)

**Status: RESOLVED in FTR.31. The original diagnosis was wrong in a way worth keeping, because it
sent two increments down the wrong road.**

**What was filed.** That `BeatHold`'s trust gate — eight beat intervals whose spread is ≤ 20 % of
the mean — was too strict for a `beatPhase01` arriving at 14.6 Hz in 0.109-beat steps, and that the
fix belonged in the tolerance, the phase's delivery rate, or wrap detection.

**What was actually true.** The hold engages **immediately on a clean clock**: fed a smooth 60 Hz
phase it reports a tempo of 0.6375 s with `isStepping` true within nine beats. The gate is correct.

The real cause was in `DancePhase`, which FTR.28 wrote to work around this very bug. Its self-rate
estimator measured **dφ/dt per render frame** — but the measured phase is a staircase that changes
only on an analysis update, so a 0.109 jump inside one 17 ms frame reads as **6.5 cycles per second
on a 1.57 Hz beat**. The lock's correction still dragged the phase onto the beat, which is why the
gait measured well (in-step r +0.799, coordination R² 0.85) and why the error stayed hidden for
three increments. But between corrections the phase free-ran four times too fast and was yanked
back, crossing zero far more often than once per beat — and anything counting those crossings as
beats saw intervals of ~0.15 s, under `periodRange`'s 0.25 s floor, and threw every one away.

**The fix, one expression:** rate = `EMA(advance) / EMA(elapsed)`, both smoothed with the same τ.
A frame with no update contributes 0 to the numerator and its dt to the denominator, which is
exactly what a staircase requires. Measured on the same capture, the same hold:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| frames where `BeatHold` vouched for a tempo | **0 / 3000** | **2650 / 3000 (88 %)** |
| tempo error vs the grid | — | **0.2 %** (0.6365 s vs 0.6378 s) |
| sway in step with the bar | +0.799 | **+0.991** (decoy +0.043) |
| coordination R² | 0.85 | **0.98** |

**⚠ Two claims made in this entry's name are retracted.** (1) That the FTR.10 beat-step "has been
engaging on ~1 frame in 8" — it was engaging on approximately none, for a reason that is now fixed,
and FTR.29's decision to supersede it on the trunk was taken partly on that number. (2) That the
gate's tolerance needed relaxing — it did not, and relaxing it would have masked this.

**★ The transferable lesson: a per-frame derivative of a signal that updates slower than the frame
rate measures the UPDATE CADENCE, not the signal.** Third instance of that family in four days —
BUG-089's trailing minimum, FTR.28's 0.133 s "dominant period", and this. When a quantity is
sampled coarser than it is consumed, every rate taken from it needs a window, not a difference.

### BUG-095 — Double-smoothed harmonic phase: a source EMA outlived its reason and every consumer was smoothing twice (2026-08-17)

**Status: FIXED in code — `TonalAnalyzer` now emits `phaseFifths` RAW. Full engine suite green
(1862 tests / 284 suites). ⚠ Witchlight is CERTIFIED and this changes its motion: needs an M7.**

**What happened.** `2861140e [FTR.3g]` (2026-08-04) added a vector EMA to the circle-of-fifths
phase inside `TonalAnalyzer`, because Fractal Tree read the field straight into hue. On
2026-08-16 `acc3c935 [FTR.19]` gave Fractal Tree its own `CircularPhaseSmoother` (D-209) —
superseding the reason the source EMA existed — but nobody removed it. **All four consumers
already smooth this angle themselves**, so all four were smoothing an already-smoothed value:

| consumer | its own circular EMA |
|---|---|
| Witchlight | τ = 1.5 s (`WitchlightPath.advanceHarmonicPhase`, D-198) |
| Nacre | ~0.9 s (`RenderPipeline+Nacre.swift:129`) |
| Cymatic | `hueTau` (`CymaticSandGeometry.swift:310`) |
| Fractal Tree | D-209 `CircularPhaseSmoother` (`MeshGenerator.swift:269`) |

A cascaded second pole does not merely lengthen the time constant — it attenuates *fast* motion
far harder, which is why the worst loss landed on the track whose harmony moves most.

**Measured, 30 s per track, total wrapped phase in circles (design: 2.1 / 1.7 / 15.4):**

| track | double-smoothed | source RAW (fixed) | design §2.3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| so_what | 0.72 | **2.09** | 2.1 |
| there_there | 1.00 | **1.80** | 1.7 |
| love_rehab | 3.77 | **15.10** | 15.4 |

love_rehab heading monotonicity recovers 0.24 → 0.38. **The §2.3 constants needed no
re-derivation — they were right all along**, and the fix reproduces them to within 2 %.

**The first wrong fix.** *Re-deriving the §2.3 constants* to make the gate green would have
laundered a 4× regression in a certified preset's hero driver. The second candidate — removing
Witchlight's own EMA — is treated below.

⚠ **The fixture rate is NOT the production rate, and this nearly produced a wrong conclusion.**
`TonalAnalyzer`'s α = 0.065 is a fixed *per-frame* factor, so its time constant depends on how
often analysis runs. `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` emits at **43.07 Hz** (1024 frames at
44.1 kHz), where α = 0.065 is τ ≈ **0.36 s**. Live analysis runs at **10.0–16.4 Hz** (BUG-087),
where the same α is τ ≈ **0.94–1.54 s** — so the source comment's *"τ ≈ 1.5 s at the ~10 Hz
analysis rate"* was accurate for production, and every τ figure in the sweep below is a
**fixture-rate** number. The first draft of this entry asserted the comment was "stale, off by
4×". It was not; the fixtures and production simply run the analyzer at different rates, which
is its own fixture-fidelity problem and is why a per-frame α is the wrong construction. Every
other smoother in that file takes `deltaTime`.

**Why the fix is still the source EMA and not Witchlight's.** In production the double-smoothing
was ~1.5 s (source) *plus* 1.5 s (Witchlight) — worse than the fixtures show, so the defect is
real and the direction of the fix is unchanged. But the choice between the two candidates turns
on rate-robustness rather than on the sweep: removing **Witchlight's** EMA leaves every consumer
sharing one source pole whose length is set by the analysis rate, and that rate is actively
moving (BUG-087 took it 10.0 → 16.4 Hz, and raising it further is an open increment). Removing
the **source** EMA leaves each consumer on its own `deltaTime`-based pole at the τ it was
designed and measured with, identical at any rate. Measured at fixture rate the Witchlight-side
fix also overshoots outright — 6.66 / 5.90 / 30.69 circles with love_rehab monotonicity
collapsing to **0.03**, a tangle, which is the preset's own anti-reference
`10_anti_tangled_scribble_ball` — and a τ sweep (0 / 0.3 / 0.6 / 0.9 / 1.2 / 1.5) found no
consumer τ reproducing the design figures, because the defect is the extra *pole*, not the
time constant.

**How it hid, and the order of events.** The committed QG.1 fixtures were captured *before*
FTR.3g, so their `tonal_phase_fifths` column is raw and every gate kept passing against a
pipeline that no longer existed (BUG-090). `WitchlightPathTests`' own comment describes it as
*"the check that caught a stray second smoothing stage cutting the travel by 2.5×"* — it was
built for exactly this failure and was blinded by its own fixture. Note the dates:
**FTR.3g 08-04 → Witchlight certified 08-07 → FTR.19 08-16.** Matt's certification M7 was on
the double-smoothed build, so this fix moves Witchlight *away* from what he signed off and
*toward* what its design doc specifies. That is why it needs a fresh M7 rather than being
treated as a restoration. Nacre is the opposite case — certified 2026-06-26, before FTR.3g, so
for Nacre this restores the behaviour it was certified with.

**Blast radius checked:** full engine suite 1862/1862 green, including the Nacre, Cymatic and
Fractal Tree suites; Fractal Tree's hue holds 87.5–101.6° across its drive frames, its D-209
smoother doing the job unaided.

**FOLLOW-UP (M7, 2026-08-18): the engine fix was right and the preset fix was wrong, and only
Matt's eye could separate them.** On the corrected single pole he reported Witchlight as
*"slightly less coupled to the beat … drifts a bit more out of sync over time"* (Nacre: *"looks
fine"*). Replaying his session `2026-08-18T14-09-35Z` through the production path under BOTH
code paths returned **bit-identical** beat behaviour — 50 downbeat bursts, 50 off-beat pulses,
flares within 10 % of a beat 86 % of the time, pen speed swing 4.13× — with **heading turns
50 → 74** the single moved quantity. The complaint was real and it was about LEGIBILITY, not
timing: unchanged accents against a stroke wandering 50 % more.

Cause: Witchlight was tuned and certified (2026-08-07) *during* the double-smoothed window, so
the cascade was the response Matt approved. `WitchlightTuning.phasePreTau` now makes that second
pole explicit and local to Witchlight; the analyzer stays raw for every other consumer. ⚠ Note
that raising `phaseTau` instead **cannot** substitute — it saturates at 68 turns however high it
goes, the same "a cascade is not a longer single pole" asymmetry that caused this defect.

Knock-on, fixed in the same increment: the calmer stroke sweeps fewer pixels, dropping ribbon
share 0.406 % → 0.368 % against a 0.40 % floor (WL.2-g) that had only 1.5 % headroom. Widening
the halo's falloff 2.8 → 2.1 *within* the existing sprite quad gives 0.433 % and 16 distinct
beads (up from 13) — the shading remedy the gate itself prescribes, and pointedly NOT
`WL_HALO_EXTENT`, which WL.2-j had to cut for fusing beads.

### BUG-090 — The QG.1 route-coverage fixtures cannot be regenerated: today's generator output reds two other presets' gates (2026-08-17)

**Status: evidence only. No fix attempted, and deliberately so — see the last paragraph.**

**What was tried and why.** FTR.25 declares a route on `spectral_level_rise`, a `FeatureVector`
column added after the fixtures were captured at QG.1.3. QG.1 therefore cannot verify it: the
fixtures are recorded CSVs with no audio beside them. `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator`'s own header
says *"Regenerate + re-copy when the CSV schema appends columns"*, so that was the first move, not
the allowance.

**The generator works.** 18 s, three vendored clips through the production chain, and the new
column is live on all three: `love_rehab` nonzero 100 % / sd 0.242, `so_what` 99 % / 0.346,
`there_there` 80 % / 0.165. With the regenerated set installed, `RouteCoverageTests` reads
**209 routes across 21 presets, 0 red**.

**But every row differs from the committed copy**, and two other presets' gates fail with it:

| gate | preset | failure |
|---|---|---|
| `MeniscusStemDropsTests` — "the beat-locked regions never go dead" | Meniscus | `perRegion[region] == 0` on `so_what` |
| `WitchlightPathTests` — "the smoothed harmonic phase travels the distance §2.3 measured" | **Witchlight (CERTIFIED)** | `circles` outside 0.7–1.4 × target on all three tracks |

**Two candidate causes, not separated.** (a) The pipeline's output has genuinely moved since
QG.1.3 — in which case those gates are asserting against a stale baseline and the drift is itself
the finding. (b) The generator is not deterministic; it runs MPSGraph stem separation and the
Beat This! grid, neither of which has been checked for run-to-run stability here.

**Discriminator, one command:** run the generator twice into different directories and diff its own
two outputs. Identical ⇒ (a), the pipeline moved, and the two gates need re-baselining as their own
increment with Matt's sign-off (Witchlight is certified). Different ⇒ (b), and the fixtures cannot
be regenerated at all until the generator is made reproducible.

**Consequence today.** Any `FeatureVector` column added after QG.1.3 cannot be route-covered.
Tracked explicitly as `RouteCoverageTests.columnsPostdatingFixtures`, which currently holds
`spectral_level_rise` and prints a FIXTURE GAP line on every run.

**Why this was filed rather than fixed.** Re-baselining a certified preset's gate as a side effect
of an unrelated preset increment is not a quiet call, and "my change went green after I regenerated
a shared fixture" is how a real regression gets laundered. The fixtures stay as committed.

**UPDATE — discriminator run, and the drift fully localised (CHR.3g, 2026-08-17).**

**The discriminator answers (a): the generator IS deterministic.** Run twice into separate
directories, all six outputs are **byte-identical** (`cmp` clean on features.csv and stems.csv
for all three tracks). So the fixtures CAN be regenerated reproducibly, and the two failing
gates are asserting against a stale baseline rather than against noise.

**The drift is not broad — it is five columns in two analyzers.** Comparing the committed
fixtures against the regenerated set, per column, as mean |delta| over the shared rows:

| column | love_rehab | so_what | there_there |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tonal_tension` | 63 % of range | 38 % | 50 % |
| `harmonic_flux` | 55 % | 36 % | 58 % |
| `valence` | 24 % | 25 % | 46 % |
| `tonal_phase_fifths` | 20 % | 9 % | 9 % |
| `arousal` | 17 % | 18 % | 43 % |

**Everything else is stable.** 67 of 72 shared feature columns moved < 1 % of range, and
**stems.csv is completely unchanged — 0 of 52 columns on all three tracks.** Bands, deviation
primitives, beat, pulse, section and every per-stem field are identical.

**The causes are named in git, and all are intentional.** The fixtures were captured at
`cc1dfcd1` (QG.1.3). Since then: `2861140e [FTR.3g] Seed the density baseline, **smooth the
harmonic phase**`, `c5b491ba [TONAL.2b] calibrate TonalAnalyzer gate from the 1000-track pilot`,
`86169538 [DYN.6]` / `21651962 [DYN.6.2] MoodClassifier: refit the flux scaler on corpus
statistics`, `a91a7915 [DYN.7] Mood: the prepared mood and the live mood become one
measurement`. Each landed with its own increment. **This is not a regression.**

**Both failures trace to exactly those columns**, confirmed by reproducing them with the
regenerated set installed:

- **Witchlight** — its hero driver IS `tonalPhaseFifths`, and the gate asserts how far the
  smoothed harmonic phase travels. `circles` now falls **below** 0.7 × target on all three
  tracks, which is the expected direction: FTR.3g deliberately *smoothed* that phase, and
  smoothing reduces travel. The gate encodes a pre-FTR.3g target.
- **Meniscus** — `MeniscusStemDrops` gates drop placement on `features.arousal`
  (`MeniscusStemDrops.swift:219`, the MEN.4a musical-arc lift). Arousal moved 17–43 % of range,
  so a beat-locked region that used to fire on `so_what` no longer does. Its stems are
  identical, which is why the stem-side explanation never fitted.

**Also found:** the committed fixtures predate more than `spectral_level_rise`. The regenerated
set adds **six** columns — the whole DYN block (`spectral_density`, `_slow`, `spectral_surge`,
`spectral_section_ratio`) plus `spectral_level_rise` (FTR.24) and `waveform_occupancy`
(CHR.3c). So the fixture gap currently blocks route coverage for three separate increments'
primitives, not one.

**RESOLVED (same day).** Regenerating was safe and reproducible, and **neither failing gate was
a stale baseline — both were real defects the frozen fixtures had been hiding** (BUG-094
Meniscus, BUG-095 double-smoothed phase). With both fixed, the regenerated fixtures are
committed and the full suite is green at 1862/1862. Drift is now **four** columns — `arousal`,
`valence` (both moved by the DYN mood work) and `harmonic_flux`, `tonal_tension` — each traced
to an intentional change, plus the six new columns above. `tonal_phase_fifths`, the fifth
drifted column, is **gone from the list**: it was the regression, not drift.
`RouteCoverageTests.columnsPostdatingFixtures` is now **empty** — every column added since
QG.1.3 is present and covered, and the gate reads 199 routes / 20 presets, 0 red.

**One thing regenerating did NOT unblock — and the second diagnosis was wrong too.** Stave's
`waveformOccupancy` route was first recorded as blocked by BUG-090; regenerating did not help,
so it was then recorded as the **QG.1.1** limitation ("offline fixtures cannot reach render-path
values"), which read as a law rather than a fixable gap. ✅ **Fixed at CHR.3g (2026-08-19):**
the generator now ticks the same `WaveformOccupancy` model from each hop's samples, exactly as
`RenderPipeline.swift:773` does per frame. The column measures 0.003–0.368, 100 % nonzero on all
three tracks; exactly one column changed in the regenerated fixtures; Stave declares
`band_dispersion ← waveformOccupancy` and route coverage reads **203 routes / 21 presets,
0 red**. Stave's certification is no longer blocked on tooling, and **Matt's M7 certified it on 2026-08-19 (CHR.3k)** — the 19th certified preset.

**FOLLOW-UP (CHR.3h, same day): the two failures are NOT the same kind of thing, and only one
is a re-baseline.** Investigated separately rather than treated as one fixture chore:

- **Witchlight — ⚠ THIS CALL WAS WRONG, and it is the most useful thing in this entry.** CHR.3h
  read the gate as a stale baseline: `circles` fell below 0.7 × target on all three tracks, which
  is the direction FTR.3g predicts, so the constant was assumed to predate the change and the
  preset was assumed sound. **It was a real regression** — filed as BUG-095 and fixed. The
  reasoning failed in a specific, repeatable way: *a plausible mechanism that predicts the
  direction of a change was accepted as an explanation for its magnitude.* FTR.3g does predict
  less travel; it does not predict **4×**, and nothing checked whether the size was consistent
  with one extra smoothing stage rather than two. The measurement that settled it took one
  command — regenerate the fixtures with the source EMA disabled and read the number: 2.09 /
  1.80 / 15.10 against a design of 2.1 / 1.7 / 15.4, i.e. the constant was never stale at all.
  **Re-deriving the target would have written the regression into the doc as the new truth**, on
  a certified preset, with the gate that was built to catch exactly this failure reporting green.
- **Meniscus — a REAL DEFECT, now filed as BUG-094.** Not a stale target at all: it clamps
  `arousal` to 0…1 when the contract is −1…+1, so on calm material the arc lift dies and a
  beat-locked region goes silent. The gate was right to fail. **Re-baselining it would have
  laundered a genuine bug in a certified preset** — which is precisely the outcome this defect
  was originally filed to avoid, arrived at from the opposite direction.

### BUG-089 — `spectral_level_rise` shipped with a 22× analysis-rate dependence; its rate-invariance test passed (2026-08-17)

**Status: root-caused and fixed the same day, in the increment that shipped it (FTR.24a). The
consumer that exposed it was reverted separately.**

> *Correction, 2026-08-26 audit pass:* the consumer came back. `FractalTree.json` now declares
> `spectralLevelRise` on **two** routes (`growth_commit`, `event_spark`) and
> `MeshGenerator+RenderClock` reads it — re-adopted at FTR.30/FTR.33 on the fixed statistic.
> The revert was temporary; do not read this entry as "the field has no consumer."

**How it surfaced.** Matt's live M7 on `2026-08-17T15-23-17Z`: *"Much worse now as the motion is
herky-jerky. Looks defective. Considerable regression."* Measured on that capture, the shipped
Fractal Tree size term against the build it replaced:

| | evt/rand | travel | peak \|v\| | jerk p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FTR.23 base only | 0.27× | 8.72 | 1.62 | 23 |
| FTR.24 with the accent | 2.37× | **31.88** | **17.37** | **589** |

**Root cause (read, not inferred).** `advanceLevelRise` measured the rise as
`levelDB − min(levelDB over the last 0.15 s)`. A minimum over a time window is not
rate-invariant: raise the analysis rate and (a) the window spans more frames, (b) each frame's
level is noisier because the hop — and therefore the RMS window — is shorter. Both push the
floor down, so the same music produces a larger rise at a higher rate. Measured on one capture's
`raw_tap.wav`, decoded once and analysed at four rates with the shipped constants:

| analysis rate | fires/s | non-zero | mean | floor window |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10.0 Hz | 0.03 | 16 % | 0.012 | 2 frames |
| 15.8 Hz (local files) | 0.04 | 37 % | 0.031 | 2 frames |
| 30.0 Hz | 0.26 | 61 % | 0.086 | 4 frames |
| 59.4 Hz (the tap) | **0.89** | 85 % | 0.184 | 9 frames |

FTR.24 calibrated against the 15.8 Hz column and Matt played back through the 59.4 Hz one.

**★★★ The test-adequacy finding, which is the part that generalises.** The suite HAD a
rate-invariance test and it was green. It asked whether a synthetic **+12 dB** step still fires at
10 Hz and 51 Hz — and a step that large saturates the band at every rate, so no rate dependence of
any magnitude could have failed it. **A rate-invariance test must compare a DISTRIBUTION on
realistic material — fire rate, duty cycle, mean — not whether one enormous input survives.** The
replacement (`levelRise_distributionMatchesAcrossAnalysisRates`) drives a repeating multi-size
amplitude pattern for 24 s of wall time at both real rates and asserts duty cycle and mean within
1.6×. It fails on the old formulation by a factor of 22.

**Fix.** A statistic with no sample-count term: a FIXED-LAG difference,
`preSmoothedLevelDB(t) − preSmoothedLevelDB(t − 0.15 s)`, where the level carries a short 40 ms
pre-smoothing so per-frame noise stops scaling with the hop (and ~19× shorter than the 0.76 s
`levelSmoothingTau` whose transient-erasing is why this field exists at all). Band re-derived to
2–7 dB, because a lag difference is a smaller number than a rise off a minimum — **swapping the
statistic without re-deriving the band is how the first version shipped.** The two real paths now
sit within 12 % (0.35 vs 0.41 fires/s; mean 0.098 vs 0.109).

**Residual.** The 10 Hz end is still ~2× off the others. It is the pre-BUG-087-partial-fix rate
and no current path runs there; if one ever does, the level needs a fixed-DURATION RMS window
rather than a per-hop one.

### BUG-086 — Per-stem features reach presets ≈5.4 s late; lag is structurally pinned to the separation period (2026-08-11)

Found while measuring driver viability for a plotting preset (CHR.1), where the
lag is disqualifying rather than cosmetic. **Diagnosis increment only — no fix
code.** Full measurement and method: `docs/diagnostics/CHR1_STEM_DECORRELATION_2026-08-11.md`
§7b (evidence) and §8 (root cause + the fix trade).

#### Expected behavior

Per-stem features (`{stem}Energy`, `…EnergyRel`, `…EnergyDev`, onset rate,
centroid, attack ratio, slope) describe the audio the listener is hearing now,
to within roughly the same tolerance as the real-time band features.

#### Actual behavior

They describe audio from **≈5.4 s ago**, steady state, on the local-file path.
The real-time band features (`bass`/`mid`/`treble`) are correct to 0.2–0.4 s, so
a preset reading both gets two clocks that disagree by 5 s.

#### Reproduction steps

Any local-file session ≥ 90 s. Measured on `beat-match-test-session` (16
full-length tracks) and `2026-08-11T01-07-17Z` (*Cherub Rock*).

#### Session artifacts

Three independent measurements, all agreeing, escalating in cleanliness:

1. Tap cross-correlation, cold start (30 s tap): bands peak at −0.30…+0.08 s;
   stems have no peak inside ±3 s, and a single broad unimodal peak at ≈10 s
   (r +0.58) when widened to ±20 s.
2. Tap cross-correlation, steady state (full 2.04 GB tap, four 60 s windows ≥ 90 s
   into a track): control `bass` peaks at **0.20–0.40 s** — alignment confirmed —
   while every stem peaks at **5.61 / 5.81 / 5.61 / 5.61 s**.
3. CSV-internal, no WAV: each stem feature against the time-aligned `bass+mid`
   sum, both at 60 Hz — **5.4 s on 39 of 40 stem × track pairs**, r up to +0.94.

Corroborates TRK.2's independent 5–10 s finding.

#### Suspected failure class

`calibration` — a deliberate offset whose cost was never measured, not a coding
error. Every line below does what it says it does.

#### Root cause (read from source, not inferred)

- `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:49` — `timer.schedule(deadline: .now() + 10, repeating: 5.0)`: separation every **5 s**.
- `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:166` — `stemSampleBuffer.snapshotLatest(seconds: 10, …)`: the chunk is the latest **10 s**, so chunk sample 0 is audio from 10 s ago and the chunk's end is "now".
- `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:333` — `let startSample = Int(5.0 * sampleRate)`: the per-frame read window starts **5 s into** the chunk, i.e. at audio already 5 s old, then advances at real time.

So `lag = chunkLength − startOffset`, and the read can only advance for
`chunkLength − startOffset` seconds before clamping at the chunk's end — which
must cover one separation period. Hence:

> **lag ≥ separationPeriod.** The 5 s head start is exactly the runway needed to
> survive one 5 s period. It is not slack.

**Chunk length is not a lever.** `StemSeparator.modelFrameCount = 431` is
commented "Fixed number of STFT frames the model expects" → `requiredMonoSamples
= 440320` ≈ 10 s at 44.1 kHz. Shortening the chunk needs a re-exported model.

#### The fix trade

Reducing lag means reducing the separation period, at one full inference per
period (cost fixed, because the model always consumes 10 s):

| period | resulting lag | inference duty |
|---|---|---|
| 5 s (today) | ≈5 s | ≈2.8 % |
| 2 s | ≈2 s | ≈7.1 % |
| 1 s | ≈1 s | ≈14.2 % |

`startSample` must move to `chunkLength − period` in the same change, or the read
clamps and the features freeze between separations (a stutter, which for a
plotting preset is worse than the lag).

⚠ **The 142 ms inference figure is the code comment at `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:211`,
not independently measured** — no session artifact records separation cost, so
the duty column is an estimate. Measuring it is step 1 of any fix increment.
⚠ `MLDispatchScheduler` (D-059) already defers dispatch when frames run over
budget, with a 2 s ceiling. At short periods deferral becomes common, so
worst-case lag is `period + deferral`, not `period`.

#### Verification criteria (written before any fix)

- Automated: the CSV-internal measurement above, as a gate — stem features must
  track the `bass+mid` band sum at a lag below the chosen target on a real
  capture. Reuses recorded sessions, no new fixtures.
- Automated: no regression in `stem_analyzer_ms` / frame budget; `MLDispatchScheduler`
  deferral rate recorded before and after.
- Manual: `dsp.stem` requires observed musical connection. Any change to stem
  timing is felt on every stem-driven preset — Aurora Veil (whose
  `other_energy_dev` route is load-bearing), Skein, Meniscus, FFO — so M7-class
  observation on at least Aurora Veil before it is called fixed.

#### Fix — code-complete 2026-08-11, NOT yet validated

Period 5.0 s → **2.0 s**, and the read start **derived** from it rather than being a
fourth independent literal:

```
stemChunkSeconds            10.0   (pinned to the model, asserted against
                                    StemSeparator.requiredMonoSamples)
stemSeparationPeriodSeconds  2.0   (was 5.0)
stemReadMarginSeconds        0.5   (slack for inference + D-059 deferral)
stemReadStartSeconds         7.5   (derived: chunk − period − margin)
→ nominal latency            2.5 s (was ≈5.4 s measured)
→ inference duty            ≈7 %   (was ≈2.8 %; estimate, see below)
```

Margin is deliberately > 0: clamping is **not** a stale freeze — the window pins to
the chunk's *newest* audio, so latency momentarily collapses toward zero and jumps
back when the next chunk lands, which reads as a glitch rather than a lag.

`STEM_SEPARATION: inference=…ms period=…s duty=…% nominal_latency=…s` now goes to
`session.log` every separation, so the duty estimate above becomes checkable from a
capture — it previously rested on a 142 ms figure that existed only in a code
comment, which is why the pre-fix cost was never verifiable.

`StemSeparationCadenceRegressionTests` (7 tests) asserts the *relationship* rather
than the values — runway ≥ period, margin > 0, latency < 3 s, read start derived,
chunk pinned to the model — so retuning the cadence stays free while re-breaking the
invariant does not.

**The gate was verified to bite, not merely to be green.** Setting the period back
to 5.0 and re-running fails the latency test with
`stemNominalLatencySeconds → 5.5 < 3.0` — so the suite would have caught the pre-fix
configuration. A green assertion that also passes against the defect is worthless;
this one was checked against it.

**Automated verification complete (2026-08-11):**

- `swiftlint --strict` — 0 violations, 503 files
- `xcodebuild build` — succeeded
- Engine suite — **1809/1810**; sole failure is the pre-existing DOC.6 rotation gate,
  identical to the branch point
- App target — **411/411** (404 before this change, plus the 7 new tests; no existing
  test moved). Required quitting a live `PhospheneApp` first — **BUG-072**.

**Measured latency is NOT yet verified, and the constants test does not verify it.**
`StemSeparationCadenceRegressionTests` gates the arithmetic that *produces* 2.5 s; it
cannot observe what the pipeline delivers. `Scripts/measure_stem_latency.py <capture>`
does, from a real session:

```
Scripts/measure_stem_latency.py ~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<capture>
```

It cross-correlates each stem's `energyRel` against the time-aligned `bass+mid` band
sum (both at ~60 Hz, CSV only — no WAV, whose per-capture sample rate differs and
silently scaled the time axis by 8.8 % in an early version of this measurement),
reports per-stem lag with correlation strength, and PASS/FAILs against a 3.0 s
ceiling. Validated against the pre-fix corpus: 15 of 15 `beat-match-test-session`
segments report **5.4–5.5 s**, matching the original finding. It also detects a
pre-fix capture from the absence of `STEM_SEPARATION` and says so, so a stale capture
cannot be misread as a regression.

*Its verification-criteria form was corrected in building it.* This entry originally
specified "an automated gate". The lag is a live-pipeline property of the ML timer,
wallclock advance and `MLDispatchScheduler` deferral — no unit test can synthesize it,
and a synthetic one would be the green-test-measuring-the-wrong-thing trap. The honest
artifact is a measurement over a capture a human supplies.

#### Post-fix captures — two sessions, 2026-08-11 (`23-35-27Z`, `23-44-40Z`)

> **⚠ TWO CORRECTIONS, in order.**
>
> **(a)** This section first reported "measured lag 5.4 s → 2.9 s, PASS" from a single capture.
> That single-capture PASS rested on r 0.42/0.48 with no peak behind it and squeaked past a
> `MIN_R` floor of 0.40. The floor is **0.60** now, and no single short capture clears it.
>
> **(b)** The withdrawal then over-corrected. The 5.4 s baseline came from a **streaming**
> capture while every post-fix capture is **local-file**, so the two were never comparable —
> but the corpus also holds a *pre-fix local-file* capture, and comparing like with like the
> fix does hold: **5.2 s → 2.9/3.0 s across two independent post-fix captures.** Weak
> correlations make each number soft; three same-path captures agreeing does not.
>
> What remains genuinely unmeasured is the **streaming** path post-fix — the path the clean
> baseline came from. The duty figures are direct log readouts and unaffected throughout.

**Correlation quality tracks the PLAYBACK PATH, not capture length** (corrected 2026-08-11
after Matt pointed out the 16-track corpus is a *streaming* playlist, which this entry had
recorded as local files):

| real capture | path | duration | best r | best lag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `beat-match-test-session` (pre-fix) | **streaming** | 88 min | **0.70–0.94** | 5.4 s |
| `2026-08-11T01-07-17Z` (pre-fix) | local file | 255 s | 0.193 | 5.2 s |
| `2026-08-11T23-44-40Z` (post-fix) | local file | 137 s | 0.372 | 3.0 s |
| `2026-08-11T23-52-49Z` (post-fix) | local file | 102 s | 0.462 | 2.9 s |

Length is not the driver: the 255 s local-file capture reads *worse* than the 102 s one.

⚠ **`fixturegen-*` are not evidence.** They read r 0.886–0.975 at lag **0.0 s**, which is
tempting and wrong: they carry no `raw_tap.wav` and their logs say
`fixture=<file> stems=StemSeparator(MPSGraph)+StemAnalyzer hop=1024` — offline generation
runs where features and stems are computed in lockstep from the same file, so zero lag is an
artifact of the method. Excluded from every number here.

**Same-path comparison — this IS like-for-like, and the fix holds.** Local-file pre-fix
**5.2 s** → local-file post-fix **3.0 s and 2.9 s**, two independent captures agreeing,
against a predicted 5.4 → 2.5 s nominal shift. The correlations are weak on this path, so each
number alone is soft; three same-path captures agreeing on a ~2.2 s reduction is not.

**Why local-file correlations are weak (0.19–0.46) where streaming reads 0.70–0.94 is
UNEXPLAINED, after five tested and refuted hypotheses.** Listed so none is re-run:

1. *Clamping degrades the features* — refuted. Correlation on clamped vs unclamped frames is
   identical (drums 0.388 vs 0.381; bass 0.413 vs 0.368).
2. *The reference signal is too flat* — refuted. Post-fix reference SD is **higher** than
   pre-fix (0.118/0.142 vs 0.071/0.115).
3. *Capture length* — refuted. A 21 s streaming clip beats a 255 s local-file capture, and
   the 255 s capture reads worse than the 102 s one.
4. *The `MIN_R` threshold* — that was a tool defect (a false PASS), fixed, and not an
   explanation.
5. **BUG-087's 10 Hz analysis rate — refuted 2026-08-12.** This was recorded here as the
   most promising lead. Two tests killed it. First, stems and bands sit on the **same clock
   within a path** (streaming: `beatPhase01` 85.4 %, stems 97.1 %; local: 16.7 % and
   14.6–16.0 %), so the "different clocks" mechanism does not exist. Second, step-holding the
   *streaming* capture's band and stem series down to 10 Hz — injecting the local-file rate
   into strong-r data — **barely moves the result**: r 0.788→0.783, 0.822→0.824, 0.871→0.860,
   0.895→0.898, 0.898→0.897, 0.937→0.938, with the 5.4 s lag intact in every case. 10 Hz
   sampling does not destroy the correlation, and the tool resolves lag fine at 10 Hz.

**One observation, offered without a conclusion:** local-file analysis frames are ~5× rougher
step-to-step at their own analysis grid than streaming's (mean |Δ| / SD ≈ 0.63–0.69 vs 0.12),
consistent with the 5× longer interval. Rough signals correlate worse in principle — but
hypothesis 5 shows decimation alone does not reproduce the weakness, so roughness is not a
sufficient explanation either. No sixth hypothesis is offered.

**This is a measurement-precision question, not a question about whether the fix works.**
BUG086.1's validity rests on the same-path lag comparison (local-file pre-fix 5.2 s →
post-fix 2.9/3.0 s, two independent captures), which does not depend on explaining
correlation strength.

**Two hypotheses for the weak post-fix correlation were tested and both refuted**, recorded
so they are not re-run: (1) *clamping degrades the features* — correlation on clamped vs
unclamped frames is identical (drums 0.388 vs 0.381; bass 0.413 vs 0.368), so clamping costs
timing fidelity nothing measurable; (2) *the reference signal is too flat* — post-fix
reference SD is **higher** than pre-fix (0.118/0.142 vs 0.071/0.115). A third guess was not
made; the honest state is that short captures are below this measurement's resolution.

**What a like-for-like before/after needs:** the same 16-track BeatBench corpus replayed on a
fixed build. That is the only capture that has ever produced a clean number, and reusing it
makes the comparison identical-material rather than a different track at a different length.

Two findings that DO stand, both from direct `session.log` readouts:

| | assumed at BUG086.1 | **measured `23-35-27Z`** | **measured `23-44-40Z`** |
|---|---|---|---|
| inference per separation | 142 ms (a code comment) | **335 ms** median (284–649, n=33) | **478 ms** median (421–596, n=63) |
| inference duty at 2 s period | ≈7 % | **≈20.5 %** | **≈25.6 %** |
| preset-facing lag | 2.5 s nominal | inconclusive | inconclusive |

**1. Inference is 2.4–3.4× the assumed cost, so duty is 20–26 %, not ≈7 %.** This is exactly
the caveat this entry flagged — the 142 ms figure existed only in a code comment with no
artifact behind it, and it was wrong. Note the second capture is *higher* than the first
(478 ms vs 335 ms median, and its **minimum** 421 ms exceeds the first capture's median), so
inference cost is variable across material or system load, not a single constant.

**It is nonetheless sustainable, on the engine's own signal.** 33 separations over a 65 s
span against 33 expected, and 63 over 124 s in the second capture — both at the nominal 2 s
cadence: `MLDispatchScheduler` (D-059) is absorbing the
load with jitter, not falling behind. Frame-pacing comparison against pre-fix captures is
**inconclusive and should not be quoted** — the pre- and post-fix sessions ran different
presets (`frame_gpu_ms` p50 0.15–0.21 vs 6.71), so the difference is preset-confounded, not
attributable to the cadence. `deltaTime > 20 ms` is 3.51 % post-fix against a pre-fix range
of 1.75–3.88 %, i.e. inside the existing spread.

**2. The 0.5 s read margin is too small — the read window clamps on ~25 % of cycles.**
Separation-to-separation gaps measured 0/1/2/3/4 s (×2/6/16/5/3). Runway is
`period + margin` = 2.5 s, so the 3 s and 4 s gaps — 8 of 32 cycles — overrun it by 0.5–1.5 s
and the window pins at the chunk's newest audio until the next chunk lands. Worst-case
inference alone does it too: 2.0 + 0.649 = 2.649 s > 2.5 s.

**The margin was sized against the wrong quantity.** It was set to absorb inference time;
the binding constraint is *deferral-induced gap jitter*, which reaches 4 s.

**Recommendation: do not re-tune now — and this is now tested, not assumed.** The earlier
version of this paragraph argued clamping was probably imperceptible. It was then measured
directly: correlation on clamped frames matches unclamped frames (drums 0.388 vs 0.381; bass
0.413 vs 0.368), so clamping costs timing fidelity nothing detectable. It also costs no extra
latency — pinning to the newest audio makes latency momentarily *better*. Covering a 4 s gap needs `margin ≥ 2.0 s`, i.e.
**4.0 s nominal latency** — paying 1.1 s of permanent latency to remove a discontinuity that
no shipping preset can currently show, since every stem consumer today drives slow envelopes
where a sub-second freeze is imperceptible. **It becomes a real decision the moment a
stem-plotting preset ships** (Stave is exactly that), and it is recorded here so that
session does not rediscover it.

#### Streaming path validated — session `2026-08-12T19-06-54Z` (Matt, 2026-08-12)

**Both paths now measured post-fix, and the fix holds on each:**

| path | pre-fix | post-fix |
|---|---|---|
| streaming | **5.4 s** | **3.0 s** |
| local file | 5.2 s | 2.9 / 3.0 s |

**The latency model in BUG086.1 was wrong, and this capture proved it.** The design claimed
2.5 s nominal. Actual:

    latency = (stemChunkSeconds − stemReadStartSeconds) + inference

`latestSeparationTimestamp` is stamped **after** `separator.separate` returns, so the chunk's
newest sample is already one inference old when the read window begins walking it. Predicted
2.50 + 0.531 = **3.03 s**; measured **3.0 s**. Inference was priced as a duty cost only; it is
also a latency cost, one-for-one.

**Consequence: ≈3.0 s is the architectural floor at a 2 s period, not a number to tune
toward.** Getting materially below it needs a smaller or faster model, not a cadence change —
period 1 s would give 2.03 s latency at **53 % inference duty**, which the frame budget will
not carry.

**The 3.0 s ceiling in `Scripts/measure_stem_latency.py` is corrected to 3.5 s.** It was set
from the wrong nominal and sat exactly on the floor, so it failed a working pipeline. 3.5 s
accommodates measured p90 inference (868 ms → 3.37 s) and still fails the pre-fix 5.4 s
decisively. **This is not floor-tuning (QG.1 / D-179)** — the gate was mis-set against a wrong
model and the model is what changed; the regression it exists to catch still fails it.

**Inference cost is higher again, and trending:** median 335 → 478 → **531 ms** across three
post-fix captures of increasing length, duty **≈30 %**, with **37 of 479 separations over 1 s
and one at 7105 ms**. The trend and the multi-second outliers are unexplained and worth
watching — at 30 % duty this is competing with rendering, and `MLDispatchScheduler` is the only
thing absorbing it.

**Clamping is inherent, not a defect to fix.** 25 % of separation gaps exceed the 2.5 s runway
(gaps ran 0–9 s). Removing clamping entirely needs `runway ≥ max gap` ≈ 9 s, i.e. **≈9.5 s
latency — worse than the original defect.** Recorded so no future session tries to tune it out.

**One observation, unresolved:** on the *same tracks*, post-fix streaming correlation is lower
than pre-fix — Billie Jean 0.788 → 0.59, Around the World 0.822 → 0.63. Clamping is the
obvious suspect, but the within-capture test (refuted hypothesis 1 above) found clamped and
unclamped frames indistinguishable, so the two results are in tension. Not resolved, and no
sixth hypothesis offered.

#### `dsp.stem` manual gate — PASSED (Matt, 2026-08-12) → **RESOLVED**

Session `2026-08-12T20-03-41Z`, local-file path, on a build carrying the fix (27
`STEM_SEPARATION` lines). **Skein** active 20:03:59–20:04:36, then **Glaze** to session end.
Matt: *"Session with Skein (and a little bit of Glaze as well) looks good."*

**Target chosen by measurement, not memory** — the lesson of the first attempt. Skein declares
28 routes of which 18 are stem routes, and `Scripts/check_route_liveness.py` verified in this
capture: **22 ALIVE, 5 NARROW, 1 SPARSE, 1 ABSENT, zero DEAD**, including all eight
stem-deviation routes (`painter_speed` and `flick_trigger` on all four stems). Glaze is the
second-densest stem consumer (8 of 9 routes). So the observation was aimed where stem timing
is actually visible.

⚠ **The first attempt was aimed at Aurora Veil and returned nothing** — it declares no stem
route at all, picked on a stale note claiming `other_energy_dev` was its anchor. That is
**BUG-088**, and the tool above exists so it does not recur.

Honest scope: Skein had ~37 s of a 63 s session. It is a felt judgement on a short window,
which is what a `dsp.stem` gate is — not a measurement, and not a substitute for one. The
measurements are separate and complete (both paths, above).

**RESOLVED 2026-08-12.** Fix `e6c188e6` (`[BUG086.1] Stems: separation period 5 s → 2 s, read
start derived from it`), merged in PR #77 (`f84d1eed`). Latency 5.4 s → 3.0 s streaming,
5.2 s → 2.9/3.0 s local file, manual gate passed.

**Carried forward, not blocking:** inference cost is trending (335 → 478 → 531 ms median, duty
≈30 %, one 7105 ms outlier) and unexplained; ≈3.0 s is the architectural floor, so materially
lower needs a different model; and the weak local-file stem/band correlation remains
unexplained after five refuted hypotheses. None is a regression and none blocks closure — they
are watch items for whoever next touches the stem path.
2. **The `dsp.stem` manual gate.** Stem timing is felt on every stem-driven preset;
   Aurora Veil (`other_energy_dev` load-bearing), Skein, Meniscus and FFO all shift.
   Needs M7-class observation on at least Aurora Veil. No automated test substitutes.

#### Related

**⇄ BUG-084** is the other open `dsp.stem` calibration defect (deviation reaching
35 against a ~3.4 ceiling). Same subsystem, independent causes; a fix increment
touching `StemAnalyzer` timing should check it has not disturbed BUG-084's
fixtures.

### BUG-082 — Session retention keeps 6, not 10: fixture folders occupy the slots permanently (2026-08-03)

> **Renumbered 080 → 082 at merge.** Filed as BUG-080 against a tree where 079 was the highest; a parallel session landed a *different* BUG-080 (gitignored-asset propagation) on `main` first, and `DocIntegrityTests` gates BUG-number uniqueness. **The commits on this branch are titled `[BUG-080]` — they mean this entry.** Its sibling was filed as BUG-081 and hit the SAME collision one merge later (a parallel `main` BUG-081, an unrelated beachball), so it is now **BUG-083**; its commits are titled `[BUG-081]`.

**P2 · app.diagnostics / algorithm · RESOLVED 2026-08-03.**

**Resolution.** `sessionFolders` now filters to directories whose name parses as a session timestamp, so a non-session directory is neither counted against the limit nor a deletion candidate. `dateFromFolderName` was rewritten as a strict whole-string `DateFormatter` match — the previous character-substitution routine did `index(startIndex, offsetBy: 10)` unconditionally and traps on any shorter name, which was unreachable while only the age-based arms called it but becomes reachable the moment every directory is parsed (a folder named `old/` would have crashed app launch). Regression tests in `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicyTests`: `lastN10_nonSessionFoldersNeitherCountedNorDeleted` (12 sessions + the 4 real fixture folders → exactly the 2 oldest sessions deleted, fixtures untouched), `oneWeek_doesNotDeleteNonSessionFolders`, `shortAndOddFolderNamesDoNotTrap`. **The regression test was confirmed to fail before the fix** — it reported 6 surviving sessions against the expected 10, reproducing the defect exactly.

**Expected.** With the default `lastN10` retention, the ten most recent *session recordings* survive; older ones are pruned.

**Actual.** Six survive. `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicy.sessionFolders` enumerates every directory under `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/` and sorts `$0.name > $1.name` on the stated assumption that "ISO timestamps sort lexicographically" — but the directory also holds permanent non-session folders, and in ASCII letters sort above digits. Verified against the live directory:

```
 1 fixturegen-there_there        <- not a session
 2 fixturegen-so_what            <- not a session
 3 fixturegen-love_rehab         <- not a session
 4 beat-match-test-session       <- not a session
 5 2026-08-03T21-07-43Z          <- newest real folder is only rank 5
...
11 2026-08-03T19-49-56Z          <- deleted next
```

`lastN10` does `Array(folders.dropFirst(10))`, so the four fixture folders permanently consume four retention slots **and can never be pruned themselves** (they are always in the kept prefix). Effective session retention is `10 - <number of named folders>` = 6 today, and it shrinks further as fixture folders are added.

**Reproduction.** `ls -d ~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/*/ | sort -r` — any folder not named `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ` appears above every real session.

**Impact.** Real captures are deleted well before the user's setting says. Observed live on 2026-08-03: session `2026-08-03T15-05-43Z` was evicted **while it was being used** as the input for Witchlight motion-sequence renders, forcing a re-render against a different capture. Compounds with BUG-081, which manufactures folders that consume the same slots.

**Failure class.** `algorithm` — an ordering assumption ("every directory here is a timestamp") that the directory's actual contents violate.

**Fix (not implemented).** Filter `sessionFolders` to entries whose name parses as an ISO timestamp. `dateFromFolderName` already exists in the same file and the `oneDay`/`oneWeek` arms already rely on it; only the `lastN` arms skip the check. One-line filter plus a regression test that plants a named folder among timestamped ones and asserts it is neither counted nor deleted.

**Verification criteria (written before the fix).** (1) Automated: a `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicyTests` case with 4 named folders + 12 timestamped ones under `lastN10` deletes exactly the 2 oldest *timestamped* folders and leaves all named folders untouched. (2) Manual: with 10+ real sessions on disk, launch the app and confirm the count of timestamped folders afterwards is 10, not 6.

### BUG-083 — A session folder is written on every engine construction, including test runs (2026-08-03)

**P2 · app.diagnostics / test-isolation / resource-management · RESOLVED 2026-08-03.**

**Resolution.** `SessionRecorder.init` no longer touches the filesystem — it computes paths only. Directory creation, CSV headers, the startup banner and the disk-space pre-flight moved into `materializeIfNeeded()`, called on the serial queue from the first actual write. Every disk-touching entry point is guarded: frame rows, `log`/`writeLogLine`, the raw-tap WAV (`createFile` does not create intermediate directories), the stem dump (`withIntermediateDirectories` would otherwise conjure the directory with no headers), and the video writer. `finish()` early-outs when nothing was ever written, so it cannot materialize the empty folder the fix exists to prevent. The banner uses `writeLogLine` rather than `log` so it stays the first line of `session.log` instead of being enqueued behind the row that triggered materialization. Regression tests in `SessionRecorderTests`: `test_construction_writesNothingToDisk`, `test_finishWithoutWriting_leavesNoDirectory`, `test_firstLogWrite_materializesDirectoryWithHeadersAndBanner`. Two pre-existing tests asserted the old init-time contract and were updated, not weakened — `test_init_createsSessionDirectoryWithCSVsAndLog` became `test_firstWrite_createsSessionDirectoryWithCSVsAndLog`, keeping every assertion and moving them one write later. **Verified end-to-end:** the full app test suite now leaves the session directory listing byte-identical, where before it added a folder and evicted one.

**Expected.** A folder appears under `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/` when a session is *recorded*. Running the test suite writes nothing to the user's Documents directory.

**Actual.** `VisualizerEngine.swift:942` constructs `SessionRecorder()` unconditionally, and `SessionRecorder.init` creates the directory, writes both CSV headers and the three-line startup banner immediately. Any `VisualizerEngine` construction therefore leaves a folder behind whether or not a session ever starts — including every `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test` run, and every app launch the user closes without recording.

**Reproduction (performed).** Count folders, run `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test`, count again: `2026-08-03T21-07-43Z` appears with a header-only `features.csv` (1 line, 0 data rows) and a `session.log` containing only the banner — no `WIRING:`, no `preset →`, no `SIGNAL_HEALTH`. Four of the six empty folders present on 2026-08-03 match `xcodebuild` app-test completion times to within 3 s (19-49-56Z, 20-01-18Z, 20-12-53Z, 21-00-25Z).

**Impact.** Two, and the second is the damaging one:
1. Test-isolation violation — the test suite writes into the user's `~/Documents/`.
2. The junk folders **consume retention slots**, so running the test suite (or launching the app a few times without recording) silently evicts real captures. With BUG-080 also in play the usable window is 6, so ~6 test runs are enough to destroy every real session on disk. This is what made a real capture disappear mid-analysis on 2026-08-03.

**Diagnostic confusion it caused.** These folders are indistinguishable at a glance from a session where audio capture failed, and were initially misread as six failed M7 attempts (a silent-tap symptom, BUG-055/BUG-057 class). They are not — they are empty by construction.

**Failure class.** `resource-management` (eager side-effecting allocation in an initializer) with a `test-isolation` consequence.

**Fix (not implemented).** Create the directory lazily on the first row write, or behind an explicit `startRecording()` that the session lifecycle calls — so an engine that never records leaves nothing behind. Either way the recorder stops side-effecting from `init`.

**Verification criteria (written before the fix).** (1) Automated: constructing a `SessionRecorder` (or a `VisualizerEngine`) and never writing a row creates no directory; writing one row creates it with headers intact. (2) Manual: note the folder count, run the full app test suite, confirm the count is unchanged.

### BUG-080 — Gitignored-asset propagation is broken at two points: fresh worktrees (and `main`) fail the engine suite (2026-08-03)

**P2 · build / test-isolation · RESOLVED 2026-08-03 — fix `2b36c34d`.** Filed P3, **widened to P2** the same day when the second gap surfaced. Found at FTR.1; not caused by it.

*Severity note:* P2 per `DEFECT_TAXONOMY.md` — "works for typical inputs but degrades noticeably for specific conditions." The verification harness passes in the one blessed checkout and fails everywhere else, including a fresh clone. No product impact; downgrade to P3 if the every-new-session tax is judged cosmetic.

**Expected.** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` passes in any checkout prepared per the documented flow — `git worktree add` followed by `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh`.

**Actual.** Exit code 1. Two independent causes, discovered in sequence.

### Gap A — `link_fixtures.sh` does not cover the ML weights

PUB.2 moved the weights out of git (gitignored; shipped as the `ml-weights-v1` Release asset). `link_fixtures.sh` exists to bridge exactly that class of gap — its own header says *"Gitignored-but-needed paths that a fresh worktree would otherwise lack"* — but `linked_rel` covers only:

```
PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures
docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES
docs/diagnostics
```

`PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/Weights` is absent. The failure has two halves: the trailing filter would also reject the files.

```
| grep -E '^PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures/|\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$'
```

A `.bin` matches neither alternative, so adding the directory alone is insufficient.

| Weights directory | Primary | FTR.1 worktree (before workaround) |
|---|---|---|
| `Sources/ML/Weights/` | 176 | 4 |
| `.../beat_this/` | 162 | 1 |
| `.../panns_mobilenetv1/` | 147 | 1 |

479 gitignored files never arrive. Failures: `StemModelTests` (6), `StemSeparationPerformanceTests` (2), `WeightChecksumTests.test_completeness_{stem,beatThis,panns}` each reporting `onDisk → []`, `PANNsMobileNetV1Tests` `.tensorFileMissing("spectrogram_extractor_stft_conv_real_weight.bin")`, and the loveRehab 118-BPM port test.

### Gap B — the primary checkout is not a complete source

`PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures/tempo/` — three licensed `.m4a` preview clips, gitignored at `.gitignore:63` ("Local audio fixtures for DSP.1 tempo capture (preview clips are licensed)") — **was absent from the primary checkout entirely**. The files existed only inside `.claude/worktrees/men-2a-kickoff-250b81/`, as real 1 MB files, presumably restored there by whichever session needed them.

`link_fixtures.sh` links *from* the primary. It cannot supply what the primary lacks. So:

- no worktree could ever obtain these fixtures, no matter how correctly prepared;
- the primary checkout itself fails the same gate;
- the script reports success (`linked N fixture(s)`) while propagating a hole.

`BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` fired loudly with a path-and-instructions message — **that gate is working exactly as QR.3 designed it**, and it is the only reason this surfaced rather than silently disabling the BeatThis regression surface.

Failures: `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate`, `BeatThisLayerMatch`, `LiveDriftValidation`, `BeatGridAccuracyDiagnostic — BUG-008`, `PreviewAudio content-hash + identity migration`. Several `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` concurrency tests (`routerChurn_…`, `deinitWhilePlaying_…`, `concurrentDoubleStart_…`) also failed at `0.001 s` immediately after tests that hung ~54 s on the missing audio — suspected cascade, not independent, but unconfirmed; BUG-078 is a real intermittent in that same area, so any that survive a green fixture run deserve their own look.

### Root cause, stated generally

`link_fixtures.sh` treats the primary checkout as an authoritative, complete source of gitignored material, and **nothing verifies that assumption**. The primary is simply whichever clone happened to receive the files. There is no manifest of required-but-gitignored paths, no provenance, and no check that the source has them before linking. Gap A is a stale allowlist; Gap B is the missing invariant underneath it.

**Reproduction.**

```
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <branch> main
cd .claude/worktrees/<name>
Scripts/link_fixtures.sh
swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine
```

**Evidence.** Three `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` runs, all at commit `935d77d3`, tree clean:

| Run | Failing lines | State |
|---|---|---|
| `2026-08-03T13:54:40-0500` | 81 | before any workaround |
| `2026-08-03T14:06:29-0500` | 81 | after `link_fixtures.sh` — **identical**, which is what proved the script does not cover Gap A |
| `2026-08-03T14:15:24-0500` | 21 | after 479 weight symlinks — XCTest half reports `0 failures`; remainder is Gap B |

Every reduction came from restoring a file. No code changed across any of the three runs.

**Failure class.** `test-isolation`, with a `documentation-drift` component: `link_fixtures.sh`'s header claims to cover the gitignored set and no longer does.

**Impact.** No shipped code path affected. The cost is **misdiagnosis** — a fresh-worktree run reads as a regression in whatever increment is under test, and `closeout_evidence.sh` honestly stamps `EVIDENCE: FAILURES PRESENT`, so a closeout stalls until someone traces it. With one worktree per session now the standing convention (D-212 process note), every new session pays this tax.

**Proposed fix (NOT implemented here — this is the diagnosis increment).**

1. Add `PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/Weights` to `linked_rel` and widen the grep filter to admit it. (~2 lines; closes Gap A.)
2. **Verify the source before linking.** Check the primary actually holds each required gitignored tree and fail loudly if not, mirroring `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate`'s philosophy — a script that silently propagates a hole is the same failure class the gate was written to kill. (Closes Gap B.)
3. Consider a single manifest of required-but-gitignored paths, consumed by both `link_fixtures.sh` and the presence gates, so the two cannot drift apart again.

Per the Defect Handling Protocol, diagnosis and fix are separate increments unless Matt explicitly approves collapsing them. **Matt approved collapsing them for this defect (2026-08-03, in chat), so the diagnosis, the fix (`2b36c34d`) and the validation below all sit in one increment.**

**Verification criteria (written before the fix).**

1. *Automated:* in a worktree created fresh and prepared with the patched script, `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` exits 0, with `WeightChecksumTests.test_completeness_{stem,beatThis,panns}` and the whole `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` suite green.
2. *Automated:* for every path in `linked_rel`, the count of gitignored files in the primary equals the count of links created in the worktree (479 weights + 3 tempo clips at time of filing).
3. *Automated:* with a required tree deliberately removed from the primary, `link_fixtures.sh` **fails** rather than reporting success — the Gap B regression test.
4. *Manual:* `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` in that worktree footers `engine=0` and does not print `EVIDENCE: FAILURES PRESENT`.

**Workaround applied (2026-08-03, not a fix).** 479 weight files symlinked into the FTR.1 worktree with absolute targets into the primary; the three tempo clips copied from the `men-2a-kickoff-250b81` worktree into the primary (restoring the canonical source) and symlinked onward. Both trees now report 72 fixture entries.

**FIX LANDED (2026-08-03, same day, pending validation).** `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` rewritten around a declarative manifest:

```
<path>|<required>|<match-regex>
  PhospheneEngine/Tests/Fixtures      | yes | .
  PhospheneEngine/Sources/ML/Weights  | yes | .
  docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES              | no  | \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$
  docs/diagnostics                    | no  | \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$
```

- **Gap A closed** — weights are in the manifest, and the match filter is per-path rather than one global grep, so `.bin` passes where it structurally could not before.
- **Gap B closed** — `required=yes` makes an empty source tree a **hard error with a path-and-instructions message**, not a silent skip. The script can no longer report success while propagating a hole.
- **New `--verify` mode** — checks the primary is a complete source and exits non-zero if not, linking nothing. Runnable from the primary itself, so it works as a standalone gate (CI-ready).
- **Missing-on-disk files warn and set a non-zero exit** instead of `continue`-ing in silence (the old line 54).

Verified by hand on the primary at time of writing:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `--verify` on a complete primary | exit 0; reports 3 fixture + 479 weight files |
| **Gap B regression:** required tree hidden, then `--verify` | exit 1, loud error naming the path |
| link mode run from the primary | exit 0, correct no-op |
| `bash -n` syntax check | clean |

**RESOLVED 2026-08-03 — fix commit `2b36c34d`.**

Closing gate: `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` run in `.claude/worktrees/ftr1` at commit `935d77d3`, tree clean.

```
Executed 225 tests, with 7 tests skipped and 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 69.842 seconds
✔ Test run with 1732 tests in 246 suites passed after 211.083 seconds.
```

Both halves green — the first fully green engine run on this material. Every failure named in Gap A and Gap B now passes: `WeightChecksumTests.test_completeness_{stem,beatThis,panns}`, `PANNsMobileNetV1Tests`, `StemModelTests`, the whole `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` suite, `BeatThisLayerMatch`, `LiveDriftValidation`, `BeatGridAccuracyDiagnostic`, and the loveRehab 118-BPM port test.

**The `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` concurrency failures were cascade, as suspected.** `routerChurn_…`, `deinitWhilePlaying_…` and `concurrentDoubleStart_…` all pass once the audio fixtures exist. Nothing is owed to BUG-078 from this filing — it remains open on its own evidence.

**The three perf tests also passed cold**, closing the FTR.1 closeout's §2 caveat. `PostProcessChainTests.test_fullChain_under2ms_at1080p`, `RayMarchPipelineTests.test_fullPipeline_under8ms_at1080p` and `StemSeparationPerformanceTests.test_separate_1SecondAudio_performance` failed at `14:27:48` and passed at `14:15:24` on the identical commit with no code change; they pass here too. Confirmed flake — the timing-sensitivity class `DEFECT_TAXONOMY.md` already names P2 — not a regression.

**Verification criteria, scored honestly against what was actually run.**

| # | Criterion (written before the fix) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fresh worktree prepared with the patched script → suite exits 0 | **Green, with a caveat.** The suite is green, but that worktree ran the *pre-fix* script against an environment repaired by hand — its output still prints the old `link_fixtures: 0 fixture(s) linked` message. What is proven is that a complete environment makes the suite pass, i.e. the diagnosis was right and nothing else was wrong. What is **not** yet proven is that the patched script is what produces that completeness. |
| 2 | Per-path link count in the worktree equals the gitignored count in the primary | Met by hand (479 weights, 3 clips, 72 fixture entries in both trees); not re-measured through the patched script. |
| 3 | Required tree removed from the primary → script **fails** rather than reporting success | **Fully met.** Exercised during the fix: exit 1 with a loud error naming the path. This is the Gap B invariant and it holds. |
| 4 | `closeout_evidence.sh` footers `engine=0`, no `EVIDENCE: FAILURES PRESENT` | Met by the equivalent direct `swift test` run above. |

**Closing on the caveat.** Criteria 1 and 2 close for real at the first worktree created from `main` *after* `2b36c34d` merges — the first genuinely fresh preparation by the patched script. That is a five-minute check, not new work: `git worktree add`, `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh`, compare counts. **Append the result here when it happens**; until then this entry is resolved on a strong-but-indirect validation, and says so.

**Follow-up CLOSED 2026-08-04 (RECON.13) — the shared manifest, and a correction to this entry's own claims.**

`Scripts/fixtures.manifest` is now the single source of truth for which gitignored files a default `swift test` requires, read by three consumers that previously disagreed: `link_fixtures.sh --verify`, `bootstrap_fixtures.sh`'s no-op guard, and the Swift gate (renamed `FixtureManifestPresenceGate`, was `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate`, which had hardcoded one filename). **The bug the duplication was actually hiding was a granularity mismatch, not just drift:** the shell side asked "is the directory non-empty" while the Swift side asked "does this specific file exist". A tempo tree holding **1 of 3** clips satisfied both shell checks and still failed the tests they exist to protect. Verified by removing one clip: `--verify` and `bootstrap_fixtures.sh` both previously reported success, and now both fail naming the exact missing path. Adding a fixture is a one-line manifest edit rather than a two-file edit someone can half-finish.

**Correction — the "3 of ≥8 fixtures" claim in this entry and in RUNBOOK §Worktree setup was WRONG.** The 2026-08-03 audit reported that `fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh` retrieved 3 tracks against a suite needing "at least eight", naming `pyramid_song`, `yyz`, `clair_de_lune`, `money`, `if_i_were_with_her_now`. Measured directly at RECON.13: the default-required set **is** those three (`love_rehab`, `so_what`, `there_there`), and the fetch script covers all of them. The claim conflated **three separate fixture systems** — (1) tempo clips, gitignored, required, gated here; (2) **BeatBench**'s 17 tracks, which live *outside the repo* at `BEATBENCH_FIXTURES_DIR` under their own sha256 gate and are env-gated; (3) **diagnostic-harness audio** like `pyramid_song.m4a`, whose only consumer is `RicercarFluidVideoHarness`, a suite with "env-gated" in its own name. `BeatGridResolverTests` never referenced `pyramid_song` at all. *Root cause of the bad claim: a name-frequency grep across the test tree, with the hits attributed to the wrong system and never opened. Same failure shape as the RECON.1 fixture deletion — a count treated as evidence.* The RUNBOOK now carries the three-system table instead.

**Still open, tracked separately.** The **third instance** — `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES` and `docs/diagnostics` empty in the primary — is not fixed by `2b36c34d`; the script now only warns about it. It is **not a regression to be undone**: the images were untracked on purpose at LFS.2 to stop the LFS bill and must stay out of history. What is owed is a decision about the *on-disk* half — re-curate locally (billing-neutral, `.gitignore:101-108` still excludes them) or retire the image-linking half and make the READMEs the authority. See the corrected THIRD INSTANCE note above.


**THIRD INSTANCE, found by the fix's own `--verify` (2026-08-03) — and it is a different kind of finding from Gaps A and B.** `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES` and `docs/diagnostics` report **0 gitignored files in the primary**.

**CORRECTED 2026-08-03 (Matt).** The first draft of this note read as though the images had gone missing. They did not. **They were deliberately untracked at LFS.2 / PUB.2 to stop the Git-LFS bill** — the "stop the bleeding" change recorded in `PUBLISHING.md` §1 and `RUNBOOK.md` — and the LFS.3 history rewrite then removed them from reachable history. Verified here: **zero image blobs across all 2,348 reachable commits**, and `git lfs` is no longer installed on this machine. So their absence *from git* is correct, intended, and must stay that way.

**What is actually defective is the half of the system nobody updated to match.** D-211 extended `link_fixtures.sh` to propagate these images precisely *because* they are gitignored — the design is: images live on disk, never in history, and travel worktree-to-worktree by symlink. LFS.2 removed them from git and nothing re-established the on-disk copies or reassigned that job to a human. `.gitignore:101-108` still excludes every `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.gif` under both trees, so **local on-disk copies are billing-neutral** — the machinery is correct and costs nothing; the larder is simply empty. The consequence D-211 named, *"silently degrades preset work rather than failing,"* has therefore been the standing condition everywhere rather than a worktree-only risk, and `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` holds READMEs describing images nobody can see.

**Restore path.** Not recoverable from the repo — re-curation from the sources each README cites is the only route back. Left `required=no` because promoting it would fail every run today, but it now warns loudly on every invocation.

**Open decision (narrower than first stated).** Either keep the `required=no` warning and re-curate locally when a preset session needs images, or drop both trees from the manifest entirely and rewrite the preset-session checklist's "look at the images" step to point at the READMEs as the authority. Not urgent, and **not** a reason to put images back under version control. Bears on FTR.2's reference curation, which per D-212 wants a low-fidelity set rather than the painterly one that left with Goldengrove.


**Related.** D-211 (the images half of this same gap, and the worktree-propagation reasoning), PUB.2 (weights → Release asset), QR.3 (`BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` — the gate that caught Gap B), D-212 process note (one worktree per session), BUG-078 (the concurrency intermittent the cascade failures may mask), BUG-079 (the other build-level gate that cannot currently run).

### BUG-078 — Engine test process traps in `AVAudioPlayerNode` teardown: `dispatch_sync` on an already-owned queue (2026-07-30)

**P2 · audio.playback / concurrency · RESOLVED 2026-08-10 (BUG078.3) — second, independent route to the same trap closed; measured 10 crashes / 14 runs before, 0 / 30 after. Reopened 2026-08-10 after BUG078.1 (2026-08-07, `f68efb67` / PR #62) closed only the first route.** Found at DBN.1 while running the closeout evidence; **pre-existing, not introduced by that increment**. P2 rather than P1 because it has only been observed taking down the *test* process — but the code path is shipped local-file playback, so the app-facing impact would be a hard crash.

#### Resolution (2026-08-10, BUG078.3) — the reschedule path, not the overwrite

**Root cause, with a stack this time.** Captured under `lldb` (`-k "thread backtrace all"`; macOS wrote no `.ips` for any occurrence). Faulting thread, queue `CommandQueue`:

```
__DISPATCH_WAIT_FOR_QUEUE__  ←  brk (libdispatch deadlock detector)
_dispatch_sync_f_slow
AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl::StopImpl() → AVAudioNodeImplBase::Stop()
~AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl → -[AVAudioNode dealloc]
_Block_release → ~AVAEBlock<…AVAudioPlayerNodeCompletionCallbackType…>
~Command → ~FileCommand → FileCommand::Perform(CommandQueue&)
CommandQueue::PerformWork(bool)
```

Concurrently: one thread inside `-[AVAudioEngine mainMixerNode]` (a second engine being built) and one blocked in `start()` → `stop()` on the provider's `NSLock`.

**The mechanism.** `scheduleFileLoop`'s reschedule path checked `playerNode === player` under `lock`, **released the lock**, and only then called `player.scheduleFile`. A `stop()` landing in that window nils the fields and runs `player.stop()` — so the command was armed on a node the provider had already released. AVFAudio's own `AVAEBlock` wrapper retains the node inside the queued command (our closure captures everything `weak`, so it is AVFAudio's retain, not ours), making that command the node's **last strong reference**. Its destruction on the node's own `CommandQueue` ran `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` there, whose `Stop()` `dispatch_sync`s into the queue it is already running on. libdispatch traps.

**Why BUG078.1 did not catch it, and why its gate stayed green.** BUG078.1 closed the *overwrite* route — an instance orphaned while running. This is a different route to the identical trap: the instance **is** torn down correctly, and a command outlives the teardown. That is exactly why `concurrentStart_neverOrphansARunningInstance` kept passing while the process still trapped: adopted == torn down was never the violated invariant. **A green invariant gate is only evidence about the invariant it states.**

**Instrumented proof of the window** (temporary probe counting re-arms issued on a non-current player, 14 runs): **every run that recorded a stale schedule crashed (8/8); no clean run recorded one (0/4).** The two crashes with zero recorded hits are consistent with the probe under-counting — it had the same check-then-act window it was measuring.

**Fix.** `scheduleFileLoop` becomes `_scheduleFileLoopLocked`, called with `lock` held, so the identity check and the re-arm are one critical section. Both orderings are then safe, because `stop()` / `start()` swap the fields under that same lock *before* the AVFoundation teardown runs: the re-arm either wins the lock and arms while the node is still ours (the teardown's subsequent `player.stop()` drains it), or it sees the swap and bails. No new ABBA against BUG-021 — `scheduleFile` only enqueues, the teardown's `player.stop()` still runs outside the lock, and the completion handler still hops off the callback queue before touching the lock (BUG-059).

**Verification against the criteria filed at BUG078.2:**
- [x] **0 crashes in 30 runs** of `swift test --filter concurrentDoubleStart`, against **10 in 14** on the same filter before. The orphan gate stays green.
- [ ] **A fast deterministic gate that fails on the surviving race — NOT achieved, and not claimed.** `rescheduleRacingTeardown_neverArmsACommandOnAReleasedNode` was built for this and **does not reproduce the trap**: 0 traps in 6 runs against the faithful pre-fix ordering (an earlier stop-vs-start shape: 0 in 5). The crash needs the accumulated load of the full churn suite — the same conclusion the BUG078.1 authors reached for the first route. The test is retained because it asserts the guard *fires*, proving the window is entered, but a green result there is **not** evidence the race is closed. The load-bearing signal is the 14-run/30-run before-after above.
- [x] **A stack for the failing path** — captured above.
- [ ] Manual app-level start/stop churn walk — not run; no musical-feel or visual surface, and the shipped risk is a hard crash rather than a behavioural change.

**Honest residual.** The fix is justified by a captured stack, a measured window, and a 0/30-vs-10/14 before-after — not by a gate that goes red on demand. If this trap is seen again, do not assume this route: capture a stack first, as this round did.

#### Recurrence (2026-08-10, DOC.7 closeout evidence) — REOPENS this entry

**The fix is present and the trap still fires.** `f68efb67` is an ancestor of the tree under test (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` → true) and `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` carries the snapshot-under-lock change and its BUG-078 comments. The process still dies with `EXC_BREAKPOINT` / `SIGTRAP` (`exited with unexpected signal code 5`).

**Reproduction rate, measured not anecdotal.** 20 consecutive runs of `swift test --filter 'LocalFilePlaybackProvider|SessionLifecycleChurn|concurrentDoubleStart'`: **4 crashed (iterations 8, 12, 16, 18) — 20 %.** Every one signal 5. First seen in a full-suite closeout run at 2026-08-10 08:43, which did not reproduce on the immediate re-run (1809 tests green) — the 4/20 loop is what pinned it.

**Where it fires.** In all four, the five preceding tests pass and the process dies during **`concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock()`** — the same test the pre-fix `.ips` reports named, and the exact race BUG078.1 targeted. The crash is at teardown, after assertions have passed, so it presents as a suite-level exit 1 with **no failing test line**, which is how it hid inside an otherwise-green run.

**What is NOT established.**
- **No stack for a post-fix occurrence.** macOS wrote no new `.ips` for any of the four (the newest report on disk is 2026-08-08 08:51:57, and the 2026-08-03 file's mtime is merely being touched). Without one, the *mechanism* of the surviving race is unknown — do not assume it is the same overwrite the fix closed.
- **The 2026-08-08 report is not evidence of a post-fix failure.** Its signature is identical (`__DISPATCH_WAIT_FOR_QUEUE__` → `_dispatch_sync_f_slow` → `AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl::StopImpl()` → `~AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl` → `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` ← `_Block_release`, naming `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` / `_startLocked()` / `stop()`), but it carries no worktree path, and on 2026-08-08 most worktrees did not yet have the fix. Treat it as consistent-with, not proof-of.
- **Whether the entry's deterministic adopted-vs-torn-down gate still passes.** Not re-run here.

**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency` (unchanged). The fix demonstrably narrowed the window — the entry records a 1-in-3 full-suite rate before it, against 4/20 on a targeted filter now — but did not close it.

**Verification criteria (written before any fix, per the defect protocol).**
- [ ] Automated: the 20-iteration loop above runs **0/20** crashes; and the entry's adopted-vs-torn-down gate stays equal over its 24 racing double-starts.
- [ ] Automated: a regression gate that fails on the *surviving* race specifically, in seconds rather than by lottery — the BUG078.1 gate did this for the overwrite and must be extended, not trusted, since it passes today while the trap still fires.
- [ ] Artifact: one `.ips` from a post-fix crash, with the faulting thread and both racing threads. **Without a stack this is a guess** — the 2026-08-07 round already overturned one confident hypothesis (the completion-block retain) that a stack disproved.
- [ ] Manual: none required — no musical-feel or visual surface. The shipped-path risk is a hard crash in local-file playback, so an app-level start/stop churn walk is worth one pass once a fix exists.

**Evidence:** `/tmp/BUG078_recurrence_2026-08-10_evidence.txt` (the closeout run that first showed it); per-iteration logs `/tmp/rep_{8,12,16,18}.log`. Both are scratch paths and will not survive — re-run the loop rather than relying on them.

**Why it was not fixed in the increment that found it.** DOC.7 was a doc-gate change (shell script + doc test + markdown) and cannot reach audio playback; the protocol's evidence-before-implementation rule applies, and there is no stack yet. Filed, not fixed.

**ROOT CAUSE (2026-08-07) — a concurrent-`start()` overwrite, not the completion block.** `start()` calls `stop()` *before* taking the lock (BUG-021, so AVFoundation teardown never runs under the provider's `NSLock`). Two racing `start()` calls therefore interleave as: thread B's `stop()` snapshots nothing → thread A's `_startLocked()` adopts engine/player #1 and starts playing → thread B's `_startLocked()` **overwrites the fields with #2**. Instance #1 is orphaned *while running*: never stopped, never detached, observer never removed. Its last strong reference is the one AVFAudio holds inside the pending `scheduleFile` completion block, so the node is finally released on its own `CommandQueue`, where `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` → `Stop()` → `dispatch_sync` re-enters the queue it is already running on. `_startLocked`'s comment asserting "the fields below are guaranteed nil" was the false premise; it is corrected in place.

**Measured, not inferred.** A new deterministic gate counts adopted instances against teardowns over 24 racing double-starts: **pre-fix 48 adopted / 25 torn down — 23 running engines orphaned**; post-fix the counts are equal. It fails in ~3 seconds instead of the 1-in-3 full-suite lottery.

**Fix.** `start()` snapshots the existing refs under the lock (a pointer copy — no AVFoundation calls, so BUG-021's constraint holds), then tears them down after unlocking with a strong reference held across `player.stop()`, which drains the node's command queue before the final release. The orphan leak is closed by the same change.

**Two corrections to this entry's earlier text, both worth keeping.**
1. **The leading hypothesis was wrong.** The strong `self` materialised by `guard let self` in `scheduleFileLoop` is not the mechanism. The crash stack has **no Swift frames** between `_Block_release` and `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` — the object released there is the node itself, retained by AVFAudio's own wrapper block. Every capture in our completion block is `weak` and none was ever implicated.
2. **"Nobody has captured the trap itself" was not true.** `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` held **25 matching `.ips` reports**, 19 of them naming `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` on a live thread, plus the two racing threads (`_startLocked()` on one, `stop()` on the other) that make the overwrite visible. The evidence had been on disk since 2026-07-26; what was missing was reading it, not capturing it.

**Sighting history, collapsed at close.** Four further sightings were recorded between 2026-08-03 and 2026-08-04 (RECON closeout, RECON.11) across different trees, each documenting the same thing: **nonzero exit with `0 failures (0 unexpected)` and no per-test failure line**, the raw tail sitting on the `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` concurrency cases, and the immediately following run passing clean. Rate over that audit: **~2 trips in 6 full-suite runs**. Two notes that outlived the diagnosis: the signature to look for is **exit-code-without-failure, not a red test** (an extractor that only reports failing assertions shows nothing), and it fires on an unmodified tree during docs-only work, so it needs no particular code state. The per-sighting paragraphs are dropped here because they existed to narrow an unknown cause; the cause is known.

**Expected:** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` completes.

**Actual:** the test process dies with `EXC_BREAKPOINT` / SIGTRAP part-way through the suite, with no failing assertion. libdispatch's own diagnostic names the fault:

> `BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: dispatch_sync called on queue already owned by current thread`

**Reproduction.** Full engine suite; dies while `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock()` (suite "Session lifecycle churn (REVIEW.2)") is the in-flight test. Reproduced **twice on 2026-07-30** at `0d3d57d2` and `4bf6703d`, and the identical signature appears in two crash reports from **2026-07-26**, so it long predates this session. **Passes in isolation** (`--filter concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock`, 1.16 s) — it needs full-suite parallelism, which makes it timing-dependent and intermittent. The suite was green at `5b019f2f` hours earlier; adding one default-skipped test file appears to have perturbed scheduling enough to make it reproduce, which is a symptom of how narrow the window is, not a cause.

**Artifacts.** `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/swiftpm-testing-helper-2026-07-30-171311.ips` (+ `-171004`, and `-2026-07-26-152850` / `-152102`). Faulting thread is named `CommandQueue`:

```
AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl::CommandQueue::PerformWork
  → FileCommand::Perform → ~FileCommand → ~AVAEBlock → _Block_release
  → -[AVAudioNode dealloc] → ~AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl
  → AVAudioNodeImplBase::Stop() → dispatch_sync   ← same queue it is running on
```

**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency` (object deallocated on a queue whose teardown re-enters that queue synchronously).

**Leading hypothesis — stated as a hypothesis, not a conclusion.** Releasing the `scheduleFile` completion block on the player node's own `CommandQueue` drops the last strong reference to an `AVAudioNode`, so `dealloc` runs *on that queue* and its `Stop()` synchronously re-enters it. In `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.scheduleFileLoop` (`:355-378`) every capture is already `[weak self, weak player, weak file]`, so the block itself does not retain the node — but `guard let self` inside the handler materialises a **strong** provider reference for the body's duration, and that reference is released when the block returns, still on the command queue. If it was the last one, the provider's `deinit` releases `playerNode` there. That is consistent with the stack but **not yet proven** — the next diagnostic step is a `deinit` breakpoint (or an `os_signpost`) on the provider and on the node to confirm which object's release triggers the dealloc, before any fix is designed.

**Note on BUG-059.** That fix hopped *off* the completion queue before re-scheduling, which addressed the lock-reentrancy deadlock. It does not cover this: the async hop returns immediately, but the strong `self` created by `guard let self` is still released on the completion queue afterwards. Same queue, different mechanism — do not assume BUG-059's fix covers it.

**Verification criteria (written before any fix).** Automated: the full engine suite completes 5 consecutive times with no `.ips` generated. Regression: a targeted test that drops the provider's last reference while a `scheduleFile` completion is in flight and asserts no trap. Manual: local-file playback end-to-end — start, seek, track-change, and quit-while-playing — since this is the shipped path.

**Verification status (BUG078.1) — ALL CRITERIA MET.** Regression gate met in a stronger form than specified: `LocalFilePlaybackStartRaceTests.concurrentStart_neverOrphansARunningInstance` asserts the orphan count deterministically rather than waiting for a timing-dependent trap (red before the fix at 23/48, green after). `SessionLifecycleChurnTests` 6/6 green. Full-suite ×5 no-`.ips` criterion met — 5 consecutive runs, 1794 tests / 270 suites each, all passing, `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` unchanged at 28 `.ips` throughout. Read honestly: against the ~1-in-3 observed trip rate, 5 clean runs alone would happen by luck ~13 % of the time, so the load-bearing evidence is the deterministic orphan count (23 → 0), not the streak.

**Manual criterion met — Matt, session `2026-08-07T19-10-25Z`, 5 local files.** Start, pause/resume, natural track end, single Next, rapid Next, and quit all passed; `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=clean reasons=[]`, drawable lifecycle balanced (4815/4815), no hang and no crash. The session is the artifact, not the impression: the provider's breadcrumbs give **19 `provider.start INSTANCE` against 18 `provider.teardown ENTER`** in the exact strict alternation `I(EXI)*` — every instance the session adopted was torn down before the next was adopted, and the unpaired 19th is the one still playing when the log ends (`deinit`'s teardown passes `diagnostic: nil`, so it never emits a breadcrumb). **Zero orphans on a real session, including two rapid-Next bursts** (3 starts inside 19:14:56, 5 inside 19:15:02).

**One honest limit on what the live session proves.** Every teardown in it is ordered `ENTER → EXIT → INSTANCE` — the *pre-lock* `stop()` path. The BUG078.1 stale-teardown path would print `INSTANCE → ENTER`, and it never fired, because the app's transport drives `start()` from the MainActor and therefore serialises it. So the live run establishes **no regression on the shipped path** and confirms the orphan invariant in production; it does **not** exercise the concurrent-`start()` race itself. That race is only reachable from a multi-threaded caller — which is why the trap has only ever been seen in the test process — and the deterministic gate is what covers it. Both statements are needed; neither alone closes this.

**Out of scope for DBN.1** (which is a docs/spec increment). Filed and reported, not fixed.

### BUG-079 — `swift test -c release` does not build, so release-only performance budgets are unverifiable (2026-07-30)

**P3 · build / test-isolation · RESOLVED 2026-08-07 (BUG079.1).** Found at DBN.2 when trying to measure a release-only budget; **pre-existing**, unrelated to that increment.

**Resolution.** Dropped the `#if DEBUG` around `ArachneState.forceActivateForTest(at:)` (the second of the two fix shapes below — the smaller one, guarding the call sites, would have silently dropped the Arachne render coverage from release runs). The doc comment now says why it is ungated so it is not re-added. `DSPPerformanceTests.test_beatActivationDecoder_30sWindow_performance` asserts the plan's real **50 ms budget in release** and keeps the 4000 ms regression ceiling in debug.

**The budget is now measured and it is met: 17.9 ms** for a 30 s window (M2 Pro, release), against 1403 ms in debug — a **78×** config gap, which is why the debug figure was never informative. No design change needed.

**One correction to the original filing:** `swift test -c release` alone still does not work, and that is not a defect — `@testable import` requires testability, which release builds do not enable by default. The working invocation is:

```bash
swift test -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing --package-path PhospheneEngine
```

**Expected:** `swift test -c release --package-path PhospheneEngine` builds and runs.

**Actual:** the test target fails to compile in release:

```
error: value of type 'ArachneState' has no member 'forceActivateForTest'
  — SoakTestHarnessTests.swift:294, ArachneSpiderRenderTests.swift:143, :189
```

**Cause.** `ArachneState.forceActivateForTest(at:)` is declared inside `#if DEBUG` (`PhospheneEngine/Sources/Presets/Arachnid/ArachneState+Spider.swift:344-372`), but its three call sites in the test target are not guarded, so they are unresolved in a release build. Debug builds are unaffected, which is why this has gone unnoticed.

**Why it matters beyond tidiness.** It makes **release-only performance budgets unverifiable**. BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN §DBN.2 specifies "< 50 ms for a 30 s activation window on M1" for `BeatActivationDecoder`; that is a release figure, and DBN.2 could only measure debug (1366 ms after optimisation, down from 17,067 ms naive). `DSPPerformanceTests.test_beatActivationDecoder_30sWindow_performance` therefore asserts a *regression* ceiling and documents the real budget as unverified, rather than dividing the debug number by an invented constant. **Any plan gate phrased as a release timing is currently unenforceable.**

**Suspected failure class:** `test-isolation` (a DEBUG-only API reachable from unguarded test code).

**Fix shape:** wrap the three call sites in `#if DEBUG`, or drop the `#if DEBUG` around `forceActivateForTest` and mark it as test-support SPI. The first is smaller; the second is what the rest of the codebase does for `*ForTest` helpers, so check the convention before choosing.

**Verification criteria.** `swift test -c release --package-path PhospheneEngine` builds and the suite passes; the DBN.2 budget test is then re-pointed at the real 50 ms release figure and either passes or forces the design change the spec calls for.

### BUG-075 — Volumetric Lithograph motion: rotary-dial spring-back + dual beat layer (2026-07-24)

**P1 · preset.fidelity / audio-coupling · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-24 (VL-PSY.5).**

**Actual (Matt live, session `2026-07-24T22-22-10Z`, Hummer):** "The motion is WEIRD… looks kinda like dialing on a rotary telephone, combined with pulsing on the beat." (He also liked the terrain-over-time morph, and the app crashed after ~3.7 min — see the crash note below, tracked separately.)

**Two causes, both confirmed from the session `features.csv`.**

1. **Rotary dial = the downbeat twist retracted.** VL-PSY.3's downbeat term was a transient envelope (`attack*decay` → rose 0→1→0 each bar), so the fold angle went forward then *returned to baseline* — forward-then-spring-back. Reconstructed angular velocity swung **−8.5 to +22.5 rad/s** with **2.7 % of frames spinning backward**. An accent on a rotation must be a monotonic ratchet (advance and hold), not a displacement that returns.
2. **"Pulsing" = a second, older beat layer left running.** The v9 drum-hit peak-lift (`kickPulse` → terrain height + palette flare + ridge strobe) was still live, firing on drum hits alongside the per-bar rotation twist — two beat-driven layers at different rates, the FA #67 "fighting itself" failure. Matt saw both at once ("dial COMBINED WITH pulsing").

**Fix (VL-PSY.5).** (1) Rotation downbeat is now a **monotonic eased ratchet**: `VL_ROT_KICK · (barsCompleted + stepEase)` off the cached grid's continuous beat position — advances one notch over each bar's first beat and holds, continuous across the bar boundary, can never decrease (reconstructed on the real session: **0 % backward**, angle monotonic). Deliberately **not** gated by `pulse_amp01` — multiplying an accumulated angle by a gate that falls in a quiet section would collapse it backward, the same retraction latent until a track has a quiet bar (a Spotify playlist will). (2) The v9 drum-hit peak-lift is **retired** — `kickPulse` and `accentFB` held at 0 — so the downbeat drives exactly one thing. The `accumulatedAudioTime` terrain morph Matt liked is untouched.

**Verified on the real session** via `SessionReplayHarness` (rows 900–1080, past grid-lock): motion gate **0 spikes, 0 frozen, max 1.68× median**. Goldens byte-identical (the synthetic regression fixtures set no beat position or drum stems, so they cannot see this class of change — real-session replay is the only gate that can, which is why VL-PSY.2/.3 slipped). Perf 10.7 ms p95, unchanged.

**Known residual:** a one-time ~24 rad/s velocity spike at the BeatGrid install (~12 s in, beat index snaps 3→7 = a 1-bar ratchet in one frame). It is a single startup event, not recurring; guarding it needs per-frame state the shader lacks. Logged, not fixed — re-evaluate if it reads as a visible snap in a live session.

### BUG-074 — Volumetric Lithograph M7 "a convulsing mess"; music-driven symmetry order (2026-07-24)

**P1 · preset.fidelity / audio-coupling · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-24 (VL-PSY.3).**

**Expected:** a psychedelic terrain flight whose geometry folds *with* the music.
**Actual (Matt live, session `2026-07-24T16-24-58Z`, Cherub Rock, chain `clean`, 59.9 fps):** "visual quality is lower and the music response is TERRIBLE, creating a convulsing mess. I dislike the look, but I REALLY dislike the motion."

**Root cause — a category error, not a tuning error.** VL-PSY.1/.2 drove the kaleidoscope's **symmetry order** (`pModPolar`'s repetition count) from audio: the vocal/energy swell moved it and every downbeat snapped it. Reconstructed from the session `features.csv`:

- swell-driven order swung **3.01 → 9.00** once stems were live — six orders;
- single-frame jumps up to **4.8 orders**; 9.6 % of frames changed >0.1 order;
- the beat snap fired **2.67 ×/second** at 171 BPM.

Two structural faults compounded it. (1) **Order is integer-valued.** `angle = 2π/order` only tiles the circle cleanly at whole numbers; at order 3.47 the last wedge does not close. Driving it continuously swept *through malformed geometry* every frame. (2) **Order is the least bounded parameter in the shader** — it re-maps every point in the world, so animating it convulses the whole frame rather than moving a feature.

Two supporting faults from the audio hierarchy. **Per-beat, not per-bar:** the downbeat used `pulse_phase01` directly (every beat) — exactly the D-154 Ferrofluid lesson ("a per-beat punch reads as a robotic metronome"), whose envelope VL-PSY.1 copied while leaving the lesson. **Hierarchy inversion:** the continuous driver `f.mid_att_rel` measured **0.009** on this track, while the dev fold-sweep fixture drove it 0→1 — so the beat accent became the only motion, the failure the audio-data-hierarchy rule exists to prevent. The synthetic fixture is *why this reached M7*; the `SessionReplayHarness` (FLY.6, built for this exact class) would have caught it, and was not used.

**Fix — turn the tube, don't rebuild it.** A physical kaleidoscope is a *fixed* set of mirrors that you rotate. So:

- **Symmetry order FIXED at 6** (whole number, never animated) — the stage.
- Ported hg_sdf **`pR`** (2D rotation) and rotate the domain before the polar fold. Rotation is an **isometry**: preserves distance, adds no Lipschitz cost, cannot open a seam, and every intermediate state is a valid kaleidoscope — smooth by construction, not by tuning.
- Rotation angle = `VL_ROT_BASE·time + VL_ROT_SWELL·accumulatedAudioTime + VL_ROT_KICK·downbeatTwist`. The swell term feeds an **angle** off an already-integrated energy signal, so a noisy per-frame swell mathematically cannot produce a jittery angle. Idle term keeps it turning at silence (D-037) — which incidentally fixes the VL.1 "frozen at silence" finding.
- Downbeat twist gated to **beat 0 of each bar** (`pulse_beat_index mod beats_per_bar`), attack 0.20 (D-157).

**Verified on the real session** via `SessionReplayHarness` (real `features.csv` through the live render seam, real viewport, real dolly): motion gate **0 spikes, 0 frozen, max 1.32× median** — against the VL-PSY.2 signal that swung six orders with 4.8-order single-frame jumps. Rotation speed chosen by Matt from a 3-speed real-audio GIF comparison (0.55 rad/s).

**Fidelity (Matt: "visual quality is lower")** — a real regression from the BUG-073 perf fix. Warp restored 2 → 3 octaves; full restore (4-octave warp + 5 terrain octaves) measured 13.5 ms, over the 12 ms gate, so partially restored at **11.4 ms p95**. Stated as partial, not claimed as whole.

**Follow-up ✅ RESOLVED (VL-PSY.4, 2026-07-24): replay-harness camera-parity gap.** `cameraDollySpeed` defaulted to 0 and was set by the app target (`VisualizerEngine+Presets`), which the engine test target cannot import — so `SessionReplayHarness` rendered every dollying preset with a **static camera**. Harmless for Fractal Fly-By (dolly 0), silently wrong for VL (the flight is its identity). **Fixed** by moving dolly speed into the sidecar: `PresetDescriptor.sceneDollySpeed` (`scene_dolly_speed`, default 0), set to 5.0 in `VolumetricLithograph.json`. `applyPreset` and `SessionReplayHarness` both seed `cameraDollySpeed = descriptor.sceneDollySpeed` — one source of truth; the app-side `switch desc.name` and the `REPLAY_DOLLY` env stopgap are both deleted. Confirmed: VL replays with its forward flight, no env var (session `2026-07-24T22-01-51Z`, 60 frames — terrain flows toward the camera).

### BUG-073 — Volumetric Lithograph at 1.0 fps after the VL-PSY.1 rebuild (2026-07-24)

**P1 · preset.performance / renderer · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-24 (VL-PSY.2).**

**Expected:** VL renders at the catalog's usual ray-march cost (v9.4 measured 7.6 ms p95 at Matt's window size).
**Actual (Matt live, session `2026-07-24T14-47-41Z`, Cherub Rock):** "the screen is black, waiting for the preset to display… roughly 8 seconds… very choppy and moving much too slow."

**Evidence.** Session `features.csv`, per-preset median `deltaTime` (chain verdict `clean`, so this measures the right thing):

| Preset | Frames | Median dt | FPS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Waveform | 35 | 16.8 ms | 59.5 |
| Staged Sandbox | 140 | 16.7 ms | 59.9 |
| **Volumetric Lithograph** | 46 | **986.6 ms** | **1.0** |

Staged Sandbox held 59.9 fps **in the same window**, through the same real-time stem separation — so this was VL, not the machine and not GPU contention. The "8 seconds of black" and the choppiness are the same fault: at ~1 fps the first frames simply take that long to appear.

**Root cause.** `warped_fbm` is two-level domain warping — **7 × fbm8 ≈ 56 Perlin evaluations per call** — and `Utilities/Noise/DomainWarp.metal`'s own header states: *"Use per-hit or per-vertex only."* VL-PSY.1 called it **twice** inside `vl_foldDomain`, which is reached from `vl_terrainNoise` → `vl_heightAt` → **`sceneSDF`**. `sceneSDF` is evaluated on every march step (~128) plus 4 tetrahedral-normal taps and 3 AO taps — so ~112 × ~135 ≈ **15,000 Perlin evaluations per pixel**. The documentation that would have prevented this was in the file being called.

**Measured (`VLBudgetProbeTests`, M2 Pro, p95):**

| | 1067×750 (Matt's window) | 1920×1080 |
|---|---|---|
| v9.4 baseline | 7.6 ms | 14.7 ms |
| VL-PSY.1 (defect) | **1120.1 ms** | — |
| VL-PSY.2 (fixed) | **9.4 ms** | 21.9 ms |
| Lumen Mosaic control | 0.44 ms | 0.92 ms |

**Fix.** (a) warp → `fbm3D(_, 2)` per component, 4 Perlin evals instead of 112 — the warp's job is a low-frequency displacement to break the mirror tiling's identical cells and never needed octave detail; (b) `VL_SDF_STEP_SCALE` 0.35 → 0.55 — step scale is a direct cost multiplier, and `pModPolar`/`pModMirror2` are **isometries** that add no Lipschitz cost, so only the (now much smaller) warp gradient needed headroom; (c) `VL_FBM_OCTAVES` 5 → 4. Octaves 3 was tried and reverted — below SHADER_CRAFT's ≥4 floor the render went soft and airbrushed, a quality regression for ~1 ms.

**Not fixed, recorded honestly.** VL remains the most expensive preset in the catalog: 21.9 ms p95 at 1080p (≈46 fps) against a 60 fps target. **v9.4 was already 14.7 ms there** — VL has never met the ~5 ms SHADER_CRAFT budget or its own declared `complexity_cost.tier2` of 2.0. The sidecar now carries the measured numbers (22.0 / 30.0) so the Orchestrator schedules against reality, and `VLBudgetProbeTests` gates at 12 ms as a **regression** guard rather than an aspiration that would fail on day one.

**Also fixed (same report, separate cause).** "Moving much too slow" was not purely the frame rate: `VL_NOISE_TIME_SCALE` was 0.015, tuned in v3.2 for the *superseded naturalistic* direction where a slow boil was the point. Against the measured `accumulatedAudioTime` rate (~0.1 units/s) the terrain phase advanced 0.0014/s — visually frozen. Raised 10× to 0.15. Camera dolly 1.8 → 5.0 u/s: at 1.8 the flight crossed a 20-unit fold cell every ~14 s, which reads as hovering, and the flight is VL's identity.


### BUG-051 — m3u playlist entries resolve to arbitrary paths with no extension/traversal guard (2026-06-15)

**P3 · local-file / security · RESOLVED 2026-08-07 (BUG051.1).** Filed by CLEAN.2.4 (GAP-10 threat model, `docs/SECURITY_POSTURE.md` §6); defense-in-depth, no realized harm.

**Resolution.** The allow-list moved *down* to the trust boundary. `M3UParser` gains `allowedAudioExtensions` (`m4a`/`mp3`/`flac`) and applies it to every resolved entry, so a hostile `.m3u` naming `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `../../etc/passwd` now yields zero entries and throws `noEntriesResolved` — the path is never stat'd or handed onward. `resolveURL` also runs **every** branch through `standardizedFileURL` (previously only the relative branch), so `..` segments are collapsed before the extension check can be fooled, and a `file://` string that isn't a file URL is rejected. `LocalFileMenuCommands.allowedExtensions` now aliases the engine constant so the two lists cannot drift.

**Deliberately NOT added: containment to an expected root.** The original filing suggested "under an expected root", but absolute and `../`-relative entries pointing outside the playlist's own directory are how real exported playlists (iTunes, foobar2000) address a music library — rejecting them would break normal use to close nothing the extension check doesn't already close. Both attack examples in the filing are extensionless. `parse_allowsTraversalToRealAudioOutsidePlaylistDir` pins that traversal to real audio still resolves.

**One correction to the original filing.** It stated the resolved path "is handed to AVFoundation … no allow-list short-circuits it first". That was wrong: both app entry points (`LocalFileMenuCommands.openLocalM3U:193` and `+Drop.swift:99`) already filtered the parser's output by `allowedExtensions`, so the decoder never saw a non-audio path. The real residual was narrower — an `isReadableFile` stat of an attacker-named path plus that path appearing in `skippedLines`/logs — and the guarantee depended on every future caller remembering to filter. Those two caller filters are left in place as belt-and-braces.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: `M3UParserTests.parse_rejectsNonAudioAndTraversalEntries` — a `.m3u` listing a non-audio extension, an extensionless absolute path, and a `../` traversal throws `noEntriesResolved`. 11/11 in the suite; full engine suite 1800 green, app suite 407 green, SwiftLint strict 0 violations.
- [x] Manual: opening a normal `.m3u` of `.m4a/.mp3/.flac` is unaffected — **Matt, session `2026-08-07T20-20-07Z`**. `origin=localPlaylist('normal.m3u',3)`, `prepareLocalFiles DONE cached=3 failed=0 total=3` across all three formats, both `advanceLocalFileQueue EXIT ok=true`, `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=clean`, tap healthy at −2.03 dBFS. Byte-identical queue behaviour to the pre-fix baseline session `2026-08-07T20-12-09Z`, which is the expected result — the fix moves the guarantee to the parser without changing what the UI does.

**Build identity was verified, not assumed.** The first run (`20-12-09Z`) exercised an app built at 15:08:13 from a *parallel* worktree (`jolly-babbage-cf1fdf`, zero occurrences of `allowedAudioExtensions`) — a pre-fix baseline, recorded here because it is the control. The closing run launched the fixed build (`…-bzbcm…`, `M3UParser.o` compiled 14:48:41) at 15:20:21, matched to the session's 20:20:07Z start. When a fix is invisible at the UI by design, the *only* thing separating a pass from a no-op is which binary ran — check it before reading the log.

**Original report (for the record).**

**Expected:** a `.m3u`/`.m3u8` entry resolves only to a readable **audio** file.
**Actual:** `M3UParser.resolveURL` resolved `file://`, absolute (`/…`), and relative entries with no extension filter and no path-traversal guard. The local-file path has **no network egress**, so nothing escapes even on a successful open. Bounded, hence P3.
**Suspected failure class:** `api-contract` (the parser's resolve contract admitted non-audio / out-of-tree paths). Confirmed.

### BUG-071 — Fractal Fly-By: descent direction inverted + severe motion aliasing (2026-07-23)

**P1 · preset.fidelity / sdf-geometry / render-state · CLOSED wontfix — Fractal Fly-By RETIRED (FLY.14, D-201, 2026-07-25).**

**Resolution: retired, not fixed.** Fourteen rounds against Matt's live M7s, ending on "deranged movement, very jittery, still passes through walls most of the time." The preset and its shaders are deleted; only provenance comments remain in `MetalFXTemporalUpscaler.swift` and `RayMarchPipeline.swift`.

**The durable lesson — an instrument-proven ceiling, not a tuning failure.** Building the whole-frame temporal-coherence measurement is what ended the loop: it showed **~13 %/frame boiling** and geometry teleporting (**diff-2/diff-1 = 1.12**). A fast scale-zoom through a self-similar Mandelbox reveals new fold structure every frame — **incoherent by construction**, not reachable by anti-aliasing or steering inside the 7 ms budget. This is the origin of the rule that motion coherence is measured *first*, before peripheral metrics that agree with the build (D-195 / `motion_gate.sh`).

**Original defect, in brief.** Live M7 failed (session `2026-07-23T19-27-48Z`, Cherub Rock): "deeply glitchy, camera moves OUT not IN." Three confirmed causes: (1) **descent inverted** — `q=(p+c)*zoom` with rising zoom collapses features toward a vanishing point, confirmed by a phase sweep and by monotonic phase in `features.csv`; (2) **severe shimmer/aliasing** — full-res Mandelbox detail plus high-frequency thin-film rims alias under motion, with no AA and MetalFX unwired; (3) **descent far too slow** — 0.12 gave < 1 octave in 78 s.

*Condensed at RECON.9 (2026-08-03) from ~14 KB to fit the DOC.6 §Resolved budget. The full 14-round narrative is in git (`git log --grep=FLY\.`) and `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV_2026-07.md`. Two lines were **deliberately dropped as superseded**, not merely trimmed: "Still open: residual moiré on grazing high-detail surfaces / Decision needed (Matt): whether to fund further anti-aliasing…" and "Also open: the descent rate was far too slow" — both were void the moment the preset was retired, and both read as live open work on a preset that no longer exists (flagged as drift in the 2026-08-03 audit). Note the AA decision they asked for is settled from the other direction too: MetalFX (MFX.1) is scheduled for deletion under D-213.*

### BUG-072 — app test runner cannot launch while PhospheneApp is running (2026-07-23)

**P1 · build.infrastructure · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-23 (BUG072.1).** Not a machine fault and not an Xcode/macOS regression — **a running instance of the app under test blocks the XCTest host launch.**

**Root cause.** `PhospheneApp/Info.plist` sets `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited = true` (added at `[U.11] Spotify: fix OAuth callback single-instance` — the `phosphene://` URL-scheme callback must route to the one running instance). `xcodebuild test` launches the test *host*, which is `PhospheneApp.app` itself, via `IDELaunchServicesLauncher`. When any `com.phosphene.app` process is already running — even one launched from a different DerivedData path — LaunchServices refuses the second instance and the launcher fails with the generic `IDELaunchErrorDomain Code=20` / "The LaunchServices launcher has returned an error". `build` and `build-for-testing` succeed because neither launches anything.

**Why it looked machine-wide.** The stray instance is a *user-session* app, not a build artifact, so it survived across checkouts, worktrees, DerivedData hashes, `lsregister -f -R -trusted`, and bundle delete+rebuild — every remedy aimed at the build products, none at the running process. Unified log for 2026-07-23 shows `PhospheneApp` PID 35320 launched 15:47:07 and last active 18:19:18; **every** `xcodebuild test` inside that window failed at runner launch (16:22:18, 16:27:52, 16:29:58, 16:30:40, 16:31:06, and the 16:47/16:53 runs — `xcresulttool` reports `failedTests: 1, passedTests: 0` for 16:47). Runs after that process exited pass.

**Reproduction (A/B/A, 2026-07-23 20:38–20:44, sdk macosx26.5, Xcode 26.6 / 17F113, macOS 26.5.1 / 25F80).** No app running → `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, 403 tests in 70 suites, exit 0 — three consecutive runs (primary checkout sandboxed, primary unsandboxed, worktree). `open …/Debug/PhospheneApp.app` (PID 80729) → same command, same checkout, `** TEST FAILED **`, exit 65, verbatim "Could not launch “PhospheneAppTests”", zero tests. Quit the app → `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, exit 0.

**Remediation (no app-side code change).** Quit PhospheneApp before running the app test suite:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "PhospheneApp" to quit'; pkill -x PhospheneApp
```

`LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` is deliberately kept — removing it would break OAuth callback routing (U.11) and would let a test-host instance and a live session contend for the system-audio tap. The repo-side fix is diagnostic, not behavioural: `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` Step 2 now detects this exact signature (non-zero exit + "Could not launch “PhospheneAppTests”") and annotates the evidence block — **"BUG-072 — not a test regression. PhospheneApp is running; quit it and re-run."** when a `PhospheneApp` process is live, and **"Runner launch failed with no PhospheneApp running — unlike BUG-072. Investigate."** when it is not. This re-arms the merge gate: a stray app instance can no longer masquerade as a genuine app-test regression, and a launch failure with *no* app running is explicitly flagged as a different, unexplained defect.

**Suspected failure class:** `environment-interaction` (a product Info.plist policy colliding with the test harness's launch mechanism).
**Verification criteria (written before the fix):** (1) the A/B/A above — launching the app flips a passing suite to exit 65 and quitting it flips back; (2) both annotation branches emit the correct line, exercised against a synthetic log with and without a live `PhospheneApp`; (3) `bash -n Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` clean. All three met.

### BUG-041 — FFO aurora flashes at track start: the drums-stem deviation driver overswings 1.2–3.3× during the per-track analyzer cold start (2026-06-10)

**Severity:** P2 (visible flashing in the first ~10 s of affected tracks on FFO; Matt flagged it on So What, There, There, and Lotus Flower in session `2026-06-10T14-55-32Z`). Same cold-start-deviation family as BUG-027/AGC2.4.1 (fixed for the FeatureVector band devs) — this is the STEM-side twin reaching the GPU through the aurora.
**Domain tag:** `dsp.stem` (deviation cold start) + `preset.fidelity` (FFO aurora intensity).
**Status:** **Fix landed 2026-06-10 (FBS.S2.2), then EXTENDED same day (FBS.S3.2)** after Matt's next read showed flashing at MID-TRACK timestamps too (session `17-50-56Z`: every flagged time coincides with an all-stem deviation burst, 3–30× track median — So What reached dev = 35). The track-start warmup was correct but insufficient in scope: the driver's response itself is now flash-proof — soft-knee input (`dev/(1+0.6·dev)`: musical values pass, bursts cap — 35 → 1.64) + asymmetric response (rise τ 0.45 s = a bloom, fall τ 1.2 s = afterimage), warmup gate retained. Gates: max per-frame output step ≤ 0.08 across the full So What series incl. the 35× burst; legacy-driver red arm proves the fixtures carry the defect. **CLOSED as stale 2026-08-03 (RECON.2) — Matt's explicit call during the production audit.** The PUB.3 flag (2026-07-11) proposed close-as-stale and asked for a one-line confirm; that confirm was given. Basis for closing: the automated gates have been green since 2026-06-10 (max per-frame output step ≤ 0.08 across the full So What series including the 35× burst, with the legacy-driver red arm proving the fixtures still carry the defect), the FBS Stage-2 live validation on 2026-06-11 is plausible covering evidence, and — the decisive part — Matt has run many FFO sessions since without the flash recurring. **This is a close-on-absence, not a close-on-proof:** no dedicated M7 was run against a worst-case hard-onset track start. Reopen immediately and without ceremony if the flash is ever seen again; the fixtures and the red-arm gate are still in place to re-measure it.
**Spawned:** the `dev = 35` upstream anomaly noted below is **no longer carried inside this entry** — it is filed as **BUG-084** so it survives this closure. *(Historical note: dev = 35 is anomalous — deviation primitives normally max ~3.4; a StemAnalyzer EMA divide-by-tiny is suspected upstream. The soft knee defends the aurora regardless, which is why closing this entry is safe while BUG-084 stays open.)*
**Introduced:** structural — `StemAnalyzer` resets per track; its per-stem deviation EMA re-seeds and `drumsEnergyDev` overswings during convergence. The aurora consumes it through the D-127 smoother (`auroraDrumsSmoothed`, τ ≈ 150 ms) — fast enough to pass multi-Hz cold-start swings as visible intensity flashes. The Stage-1 spike-driver replacement removed the OTHER flicker source (`f.bass` jitter into spike geometry), making this one prominent.
**Resolved:** —

**Expected:** the aurora arrives smoothly when a track starts.

**Actual (session `2026-06-10T14-55-32Z`, first 10 s of each track, 150 ms-smoothed driver):** flagged tracks — Lotus Flower smoothed peak **2.35**, So What **1.23**, There, There **1.37** (smoothed jitter 0.45–0.91/s); unflagged — Love Rehab peak 0.23, jitter 0.02/s. The flashing maps exactly onto the measured overswing. Steady-state (10–20 s) values are far lower. The pulse, spike strength, and the BUG-038-smoothed light multiplier are all calm in the same windows (measured — they are excluded as causes).

**Reproduction steps:** play the 6-track streaming playlist on FFO; observe the aurora in the first ~10 s of So What / There, There / Lotus Flower; compare `stems.csv` `drumsEnergyDev` early-window values against the 10–20 s window.

**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-10T14-55-32Z/` (`stems.csv` drums columns; the per-track table above).

**Suspected failure class:** `calibration` (deviation cold-start overswing, BUG-027 class) — consumed un-warmed by a brightness layer.

**Fix (FBS.S2.2):** a per-track quadratic warmup gate on the aurora's drums driver (`RenderPipeline.auroraDriverStep` — D-127 smoother × `warmup²`, 0 → 1 over 10 s, reset by the existing `resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` track-change hook). The gate is smallest exactly where the overswing peaks (2–6 s; Lotus's 2.35 spike lands on gate ≈ 0.16) and is ~1 once the analyzer has converged; steady state is byte-identical after 10 s. Measured on the session fixtures: early peaks 2.35/1.37/1.23 → **0.65/0.50/1.10**. Linear was tried and measured insufficient (Lotus still reached 1.23).

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated (real-session replay through the production arithmetic, `AuroraTrackStartWarmupTests`): early-window (0–10 s) driver peak ≤ max(1.0, steady-state peak) on all three flagged tracks, red-arm reproduction of the flash on the two unambiguous ones, steady state byte-identical. *(Criterion AMENDED from the original "≤ 1.5× steady": Lotus's drums settle to ~0 steady — a steady-relative bound is unmeetable; So What's steady runs hot (1.64) so its early window is not anomalous. So What's perceived flashing is partly general drums-dev jitter on sparse jazz — a separate aurora-character question, noted, not chased here.)*
- [ ] Manual: Matt confirms the aurora arrives without flashing on So What / There, There / Lotus Flower track starts.

**Manual validation required:** Yes — felt visual artifact.

**Related:** BUG-027/AGC2.4.1 (the band-dev cold-start warmup — the fix pattern to mirror on the stem side or at the aurora's consumption point), BUG-029/AGC3 (the `f.bass` cold-start spike — same family, different path), D-127 (the aurora smoother), FBS (this became visible once the spike driver stopped flickering).

### BUG-068 — LF multi-file plan order diverges from the URL queue after a mid-queue preparation failure (2026-07-11)

**P1 · local-file / pipeline-wiring · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (PUB.2, `22ded35` + `1ae6900`).** Fix: `SessionPreparationResult.orderedTracks` built by the `PrepOutcomes` accumulator (walk-order interleave of prepared identities and failure placeholders); both plan-assembly sites consume it. All three verification criteria met: regression `startLocalFiles_midQueueFailure_preservesURLQueueOrder` + no-failure control (existing ordering test), 53 session tests green, streaming site shares the ordered source. Found by the 2026-07-11 pre-publication ultra review; adversarially verified against the code. Diagnose+fix collapsed into one increment per Matt's Phase-1 go (the root cause is statically provable — no instrumentation step needed).

**Expected:** with a multi-file queue `[A, B, C]` where B fails preparation, `SessionPlan.tracks[i]` corresponds to `urls[i]` for every i — track 2's slot carries B's placeholder identity, so B's audio plays against B's (partial) identity and C's audio against C's identity/beat grid.
**Actual:** `SessionPreparer._runLocalFilePreparation` appends successes and failures to two separate arrays; `SessionManager.startLocalFiles` (`SessionManager.swift:472`) builds the plan as `cachedTracks + failedTracks` → plan `[A, C, B]` against playback order `[A, B, C]`. From the failure onward every track index pairs the wrong audio with identity, cached beat grid, stems, and chrome. The code comment "Order matches the original URL queue because the preparer walks in order" is false for any mid-queue failure. The streaming path (`SessionManager.swift:308`) has the same concatenation; consequence there is bounded (track matching is identity-based; only the planner's playlist-order arc degrades).
**Reproduction:** unit-level — 3-URL queue, delegate fails url[1] (see verification criteria). Live — any LF multi-file session where a non-final file has no preparable stems.
**Session artifacts:** none required — the defect is statically provable from the two cited sites; `WIRING: SessionPreparer.prepareLocalFile #n` log lines confirm walk order in any historical multi-file session.
**Suspected failure class:** `api-contract` (result type discards the input ordering the consumer depends on).
**Verification criteria (written before the fix):** (1) new regression test: 3-file queue with the middle file failing → plan order `[A, B(placeholder), C]`, and a control with no failure → order unchanged; (2) existing LF/session suites green; (3) streaming plan assembly uses the same order-preserving source. Manual: not required for the ordering fix itself (no musical-feel/visual change); any normal multi-file LF session doubles as a no-regression walk.

### BUG-069 — VisualizerEngine cross-thread analysis fields unguarded (`currentFamilySeries` Array race) (2026-07-11)

**P1 · app.engine / concurrency · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (PUB.2, `3d89692`).** Fix: `analysisStateLock` accessors for the four VisualizerEngine fields (compound updates documented benign); `trackMetadataLock` for the MIRPipeline pair. Criteria met: all five fields lock-routed with guards documented, full engine+app suites green, TSan MIRPipeline spot-run clean. Found by the 2026-07-11 pre-publication ultra review; adversarially verified. Diagnose+fix collapsed into one increment per Matt's Phase-1 go (statically provable data race).

**Expected:** every field crossing MainActor ↔ `analysisQueue` is lock-guarded (the `tapSampleRate` pattern, `VisualizerEngine.swift:395–420`) or confined to one queue.
**Actual:** `currentFamilySeries: [InstrumentFamilyActivity]` (`VisualizerEngine.swift:452`) is reassigned on MainActor in `resetStemPipeline` (`+Stems.swift:482,517` — every track change) while `processAnalysisFrame` samples it at ~94 Hz on the serial analysis queue (`+Audio.swift:234`). A Swift Array reassignment concurrent with a read is memory-unsafe (CoW storage can be deallocated mid-read), not merely stale — a rare-crash class. Sibling unguarded crossings in the same class: `liveBeatAnalysisAttempts`, `runtimeRecalibrationDone` (MainActor reset in `resetStemPipeline` vs analysisQueue read/increment in `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded` / recalibration), `pendingDispatchStartTime` (stemQueue completion vs analysis-path reads). Related engine-side twin: `MIRPipeline.currentTrackName`/`currentArtistName` (`MIRPipeline.swift:97–98`) written from the app metadata callback, read on the analysis queue on the recording path — unguarded String race, same class.
**Reproduction:** timing-dependent; provable statically. TSan on a track-change-heavy session is the runtime discriminator (`Scripts/tsan_stress.sh`).
**Session artifacts:** none — no crash on record attributable yet (the point is to fix it before contributors' machines find it).
**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency`.
**Verification criteria (written before the fix):** (1) all five fields route through a lock (accessor pattern) or are queue-confined, with the guard documented on each; (2) full engine + app suites green; (3) TSan spot-run of the stem/analysis suites shows no new races on these fields. Manual: none (no behavioural change intended); benign bounded lost-update on `liveBeatAnalysisAttempts` reset-vs-increment is documented at the accessor.

### BUG-067 — Ricercar FL.5 fails the WCAG overlay-contrast gate on main (2026-07-09)

**P3 · preset.fidelity / regression · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (Ricercar-rework merge).** Surfaced by the QG.1 pre-flight full battery; resolved by merging the FL.10 dark-ground flow-field.

**Expected:** `PresetContrastCertificationTests` requires white overlay text to clear WCAG 4.5:1 contrast over any preset frame + overlay backdrop.
**Actual (before):** Ricercar failed deterministically on all three fixtures — contrast **3.52 < 4.5** (`PresetContrastCertificationTests.swift:59/78/97`). Reproduced in isolation, not environmental, not flaky.
**Root cause:** main's Ricercar was the FL.5 fluid-dye state (a **light** warm ground → low contrast under white text), superseded by the `claude/ricercar-rework` branch (FL.10 glowing particle flow-field on a **dark** ground, M7-passed 2026-07-08 — see the ricercar-and-instrument-capture memory).
**Resolution:** merged `claude/ricercar-rework` to main (2026-07-09, merge `694bbc0`). The FL.5 fluid geometry (`RicercarFluid*`) was replaced by the FL.10 flow-field (`RicercarFlow*`) on a deep/dark ground; `PresetContrastCertificationTests` now passes for Ricercar in isolation (0.12 s). Ricercar remains `certified: false` (FL.10 M7-passed but not yet formally certified); a route-coverage manifest backfill is a spun-off follow-up.
**Failure class:** pre-existing regression on a superseded preset state, cleared by the intended replacement.

### QG.1.1 — Ricercar route-coverage: 4 family-capture reads (armed + green at QG.1.3)

**✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (QG.1.3).** The 4 family-capture reads are armed and green. `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` now runs `InstrumentFamilyAnalyzer.analyzeFamilyActivity` over each clip and merges the per-frame `*Activity`/`*ActivityDev` into the stems rows (sampled by playback position, mirroring the live `setInstrumentFamilyActivity`); the 4 `*ActivityDev` routes are declared in `Ricercar.json`; the 3 route-coverage fixtures were regenerated (52-col stems.csv). `RouteCoverageTests`: **156 routes / 14 presets, 0 red**; `AudioRouteSchemaTests` green. The minimal variant held — PANN prob jitter clears the 1e-5 `continuous` floor on all 3 non-orchestral clips (audited per-column before declaring: strongest is `so_what`'s trumpet-led `brassActivityDev`, max 0.497; weakest is `love_rehab`'s `woodwindsActivityDev`, stddev 1.5e-4, still ~15× the floor). No orchestral fixture needed.

**NOTE · coverage-gap history (documented, not a defect).** The BUG-067 follow-up backfilled Ricercar's `audio_routes` manifest. Ricercar (FL.13 flow-field) reads **11** audio primitives; **7 were declared** at QG.1.2 (`flow_vigour` ← `bass/mid/trebDev`; `{strings,brass,woodwinds,percussion}_ribbon` ← the band-stem `{vocals,bass,other,drums}EnergyDev` half of each per-colour hybrid). The other **4 reads** — the family-capture half of each colour's hybrid — were deferred as not-yet-armed (QG1_REPLAY_AUDIT §not-yet-armed convention) and are armed at QG.1.3 (see RESOLVED above):

- The family-capture half of each colour's `max(band-stem dev, family-capture dev)` hybrid — `stringsActivityDev`, `brassActivityDev`, `woodwindsActivityDev`, `percussionActivityDev`. In the checked-in fixtures these columns are exactly 0 (stddev 0.00), so declaring them would red the un-gated battery. Not a dead route: each ribbon's visual behaviour is already gate-covered via its band-stem primitive.

**Root cause of the 0 (verified 2026-07-09):** the offline `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` runs only `StemAnalyzer.analyze` (no PANN). Family-capture is **Layer-5a preview-derived** — the `InstrumentFamilyAnalyzer` (PANNs MobileNetV1) sweep, injected live via `RenderPipeline.setInstrumentFamilyActivity` (IFC.4/D-177) — which the generator never runs, so `*Activity` is written as structural 0 **regardless of clip**. This is the same offline-can't-populate class as the existing QG.1.1 boundary, not merely a genre-of-fixture gap.

**Arm trigger:** extend `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` to run `InstrumentFamilyAnalyzer.analyzeFamilyActivity` offline (headless samples-in → activity-out, the path SessionPreparer uses) and merge per-frame `*Activity`/`*ActivityDev` into the stems rows — that alone makes the columns non-constant (PANN prob jitter) → the 4 routes clear the just-above-noise `continuous` floor. An orchestral `route_coverage` fixture then gives them real amplitude. Then declare the 4. **Do NOT tune the floor to pass them** (QG.1).

**FL.14 sequencing:** FL.14 (per-family articulation, on `claude/ricercar-fl14-prompt-7de805`, not yet on main) adds 4 more reads — `{vocals,bass,other,drums}AttackRatio` → `*_articulation` line-character routes. `AttackRatio` is alive on all genres, so those 4 **are** armable and should be declared in the FL.14 integration commit (manifest → 11 declared once FL.14 lands). Certifying Ricercar (`FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresetsDeclareAudioRoutes`) requires a non-empty manifest — already satisfied.

### BUG-066 — MoodClassifier flux input ran 16× hot on the offline path; saturated on every track (2026-07-08)

**P2 · ml.mood / dsp.mir · ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-08 (MOOD-FLUX.2, `1d61830`).** Matt signed off on the objective `--mood-ab` before/after evidence (no live M7 — an eyeball made no sense for a diffuse scoring change). Full record: [`docs/diagnostics/BUG-066-diagnosis.md`](../diagnostics/BUG-066-diagnosis.md).

**Expected:** the MoodClassifier z-scores its 10 inputs against the scaler fit on the **live** pipeline's features (`d586e57` retrained on live-annotated tracks); `spectralFlux` (mean 0.25, std 0.20) should land within a few sigma.
**Actual:** CENSUS.3 (n=993) measured the **offline** flux input mean at **8.06** — z ≈ **+38**; saturated on essentially every track. Band energies and centroid match the scaler within ~20 %.
**Root cause (corrected — NOT a train-vs-inference mismatch):** the model is correctly trained on live features (the live training CSV `~/phosphene_features_annotated.csv` flux mean 0.2516 = the scaler). The offline `SessionPreparer.analyzeMIR.computeFFTMagnitudes` **reimplemented the FFT magnitude formula** differently from the live `Audio/FFTProcessor`: `sqrt(power/fftSize)` = |FFT|/32 vs live `|FFT|×2/fftSize` = |FFT|/512 — a uniform **16×**. Same hop (1024). Flux is fed **raw** into the z-score ([MIRPipeline.swift:66](../../PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift)); bands are AGC-normalized and centroid/chroma are ratios → scale-invariant → they matched. Flux is the only exposed feature (the discriminator; pre/post ratio exactly 16.000, σ=0).
**Impact:** `TrackProfile.mood` (set by `analyzeMIR`) is 30 % of `DefaultPresetScorer` → offline preset selection ran on 9 effective features. The **live** mood path was always correct; no live regression.
**Failure class:** regression / pipeline-wiring (offline path drifted from the live FFT formula).
**Fix (MOOD-FLUX.2):** align the offline formula to live — `vDSP_zvabs` + `×2/fftSize` (in `SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift` + the `CorpusCensusRunner` mirror). **Validated:** flux z **+38 → +1.43**, uniform 16× correction, 103 mood/MIR/session-prep/spectral tests green incl. `MoodClassifierGolden` (classifier untouched — this is a feature-extraction fix); blast radius benign (mir_bpm 0/40 changed; key 6/40 empty→resolved, harmless; centroid ratio-invariant).
**Sign-off (2026-07-08):** the live M7 was retired as unfit for a diffuse scoring change; replaced by the objective `CorpusCensusRunner --mood-ab` before/after (80-track sample) — before, saturated flux railed arousal high for every track → non-discriminative "happy" (Beethoven adagios read euphoric); after, arousal spans [−0.87,+0.81], spread ~doubled, **32 % of tracks flip mood quadrant** in the correct direction (calm tracks read calm). Matt: "bug is resolved."

### BUG-064 — Lumen Mosaic freezes during local-file playback (works on Spotify) (2026-06-28)

**P1** · dsp.beat / preset · **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-29** — Matt live-confirmed on the correct build (sessions `…T02-29-56Z` "looks good" + `…T12-49-44Z` "much better"); the `LUMEN_DIAG` instrument has been removed. Split from BUG-063 after the triple-buffer revert fixed Lumen on Spotify but Matt observed it still frozen on local files (sessions `…T15-32-06Z`, `…T15-50-01Z`, `…T21-04-51Z` + a GPU frame capture).

#### Expected behavior
During local-file playback, Lumen Mosaic animates exactly as on Spotify — the Voronoi cells change colour on the beat and the four lights move with the music.

#### Actual behavior
The mosaic renders correctly but is **static** — cells do not recolour; only a faint per-beat pulse (the separately-driven lights) is visible.

#### Reproduction steps
Play a local audio file, switch to Lumen Mosaic, watch >10 s. Worst on a fast track — session `…T21-04-51Z` is "01 Cherub Rock.mp3" (Smashing Pumpkins, 171 BPM).

#### Root cause
Pinned by the `LUMEN_DIAG` buffer-binding probe (session `…T21-04-51Z`), which **disproved the initial "stale slot-8 GPU read" hypothesis**: `boundIsEngine=true` every frame and `boundBass` tracks `state.bassCounter` exactly — the GPU is bound to the engine's own live buffer and the bytes are fresh. The real cause is upstream in the engine: the cell-step **band counters stall** (`counters=[5 2 1]` frozen after ~12 s). They advance in `LumenPatternEngine.updateBandCounters` on a `beatPhase01` wrap, detected as `prev > 0.85 && now < 0.15`. But the analyzer publishes `beatPhase01` at **~10 Hz**, so on a fast track it advances in **~0.27 jumps** that skip both narrow windows (e.g. `0.795→0.109` has prev < 0.85; `0.934→0.203` has now > 0.15). Only the rare step landing in `prev∈(0.85,0.88)` registers → ~5 of ~34 beats counted, then none. The cells recolour on those counters → frozen; the lights (driven off stems, separately) keep pulsing. (The earlier "litTex 900×600 = low quality" note was a red herring — 900×600 is just the window backing size; render scale is irrelevant.)

#### Failure class
`algorithm` (dsp.beat) — the wrap detector assumed small per-frame phase steps; it is not robust to the analyzer's coarse publish cadence on fast tracks. Not a render/GPU/binding defect.

#### Fix
`updateBandCounters` now detects a wrap as a **half-cycle phase drop** (`prevBeatPhase01 − beatPhase01 > 0.5`, the new `beatWrapDropThreshold`), which catches every wrap regardless of step size and never trips on a forward advance or a small drift-correction. Regression: `test_bug064_largeStepWraps_stillIncrementCounter` drives the recorded 171-BPM trajectory (the old two-window detector counts **0** wraps; the new one counts **4**).

#### Verification criteria
Automated: ✅ `test_bug064_largeStepWraps_stillIncrementCounter` + all 32 Lumen suites + app build + lint 0. Manual (required): Matt confirms the cells recolour on the beat during **local-file** playback (and still on **Spotify** — same code path). Then the `LUMEN_DIAG` instrument is removed.

### BUG-014 — Lumen Mosaic panel aggregate uniform across tracks (LM.4.6 limitation superseded by LM.4.7 palette library; resolved 2026-05-18)

**Severity:** P3 (visible but accepted at cert time; impact is "every Lumen Mosaic session feels statistically similar at the panel level" rather than a hard quality regression — Matt accepted the trade-off at LM.4.6 with the verdict *"Working. It's close enough. I'm giving up the fight on colors,"* and the 2026-05-17 palette exploration converged on a structural fix.)
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — LM.4.7 palette library. The M7 condition was met: the anti-repeat window was widened same-day *after Matt's M7 session* (see Resolved paragraph below), and Lumen has passed multiple live M7s since (BUG-064 sessions 2026-06-29). Index row reconciled at PUB.3 — it had drifted from this entry.
**Introduced:** Documented as a known trade-off at LM.4.6 (`c0f9ccf3`, 2026-05-12) — the shader file header, the ENGINEERING_PLAN Increment LM.4.6 "Honest math caveat" section, and the D-LM-7 amendment all explicitly call it out. LM.7 (`888bb856`-following commits, 2026-05-12) mitigated it at the aggregate-mean level via the per-track chromatic-projected tint (D-LM-7); the palette-character-per-session gap remained.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-18, LM.4.7 implementation (commit pending). `lm_cell_palette` rewritten to palette-table lookup over a per-song 12-colour drawn palette. The Orchestrator selects one of 18 hand-authored palettes per song via mood-biased Gaussian-over-distance draw with anti-repeat exclusion of the last `kAntiRepeatWindow = 3` drawn palettes (widened from N=1 same day after Matt's M7 session showed within-quadrant clustering — see D-LM-palette-library amendment + release-note `[dev-2026-05-18-b]`). New `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` holds the catalogue + `selectPalette(...)` algorithm; new slot-8 ABI fields carry the 12-entry palette payload; `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` regression-locks the six LM.4.7 contract suites (palette membership, selection determinism, anti-repeat over the full recent-window, mood-weighted distribution shape, LM.9 pale-tone-share ≤ 0.30 for all 18 palettes, scripted track-sequence reproducibility). LM.7's chromatic-projection tint (`kTintMagnitude` + raw-tint vector) retired with this increment.

### Expected behavior

Different songs should produce visibly distinct **palette character** at the panel level — a track drawing Cathedral Lights should read as light-through-stained-glass, a track drawing Refn Glow as warm-neon-shadow, a track drawing Glacier as frozen-blue-on-snow. Within a song, every cell can still be any colour the palette's 12 entries allow; across songs, the listener perceives the palette changing at track boundaries.

### Actual behavior (LM.4.6 + LM.7 baseline)

The cell-colour generator (`lm_cell_palette`) samples uniformly from the full RGB cube on every track, with LM.7's per-track tint sliding the sampling window by `±0.20` per channel along the chromatic plane. At ~30 visible cells per panel, law-of-large-numbers convergence makes the **aggregate distribution shape** (mean, hue histogram, saturation distribution) statistically identical across tracks except for the chromatic-plane offset. The aggregate-mean offset gives each track a faintly distinct **tint** but does not give it a distinct **palette character** — every panel still looks like a sample from the same uniform RGB cube with a small chromatic shift.

### Reproduction steps

1. Run a multi-track Lumen Mosaic session against the LM.4.6 + LM.7 baseline (any commit between `c0f9ccf3` / `888bb856` and the LM.4.7 implementation commit).
2. Compare 3–4 panel screenshots taken at the same beat phase across 3–4 different tracks.
3. Observe: the panels are distinguishable (different specific colours per cell, slight chromatic-mean offset) but the overall **palette identity** does not vary — each panel reads as "a random sample from the same uniform-RGB distribution."

The contact-sheet output of `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` makes the failure mode visible across the 9-fixture set.

### Suspected failure class

`algorithm` — the cell-colour generator's sampling distribution shape is track-invariant by construction. LM.7's tint mitigates the **mean** of the distribution but not the **shape**. The fix is a structural replacement of the cell-colour source — palette-library-driven per-cell sampling with per-session palette selection — not a tuning pass on the existing generator.

### Verification criteria

- Automated: `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` asserts palette membership (every cell colour matches one of the 12 palette entries to within float epsilon) per LM.4.7's rewritten test suite; per-song selection determinism (same `(track ID, previous-palette)` → same drawn palette); immediate-repeat exclusion (consecutive tracks cannot share a palette).
- Manual: Matt M7 review on a real-music multi-track session — each song's palette reads as its named character (e.g. a track drawing Cathedral Lights reads as stained-glass; a track drawing Refn Glow reads as warm-neon-shadow) at the panel level, distinct from neighbouring tracks' palettes; the palette change at track boundaries is visible.
- Mechanical: the LM.9 pale-tone-share gate (≤ 0.30; per D-LM-cream-rescission) passes for all 18 palettes — Cathedral Lights specifically must pass at its ~17 % nominal share (2 of 12 palette entries pale under the rule's linear-RGB definition; see D-LM-cream-rescission Erratum).

- D-LM-cream-rescission (this session) — the anti-cream rule rescission is what makes pale-rich palettes (Cathedral Lights, Cycladic, Ming Porcelain) shippable inside the library.

### BUG-063 — Lumen Mosaic freeze: the slot-8 triple-buffer "fix" was a regression; reverted to known-good (2026-06-26)

**P1** · renderer / render-state · **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-29 — subsumed by BUG-064.** The triple-buffer regression was reverted (2026-06-27, below); the Lumen freeze was then root-caused + fixed under BUG-064 (cell-step wrap detector) and Matt live-confirmed ("looks good" / "much better"). The `LUMEN_DIAG` instrument this entry kept "for the confirm" is removed (`17ebfe5`); no separate confirm outstanding. Surfaced live by Matt 2026-06-26 after the BUG-062 fix made every preset appear. **Three diagnoses were attempted; the first fix was actively harmful:**
1. **Slot-8 write-during-read race** → fix `f5ad0e2` (triple-buffer the slot-8 buffer). Never reproduced as a race; **this fix is the regression** (see below).
2. **GPU ray-march collapse** (reading the constant ~0.88 ms `frame_gpu_ms`) → wrong: 0.88 ms is *normal* for Lumen's audio-static geometry.
3. **Frozen stem-warmup snapshot** (first ~10 s) → a *real* secondary observation, but NOT the dominant freeze; the warmup gate built for it never reached Matt's build.

**The regression (session `…T21-14-35Z`):** Matt reports Lumen "worked like a dream before" and is now frozen nearly the whole playback (moved twice, faint beat pulse, **no cell-colour change**) — "possibly the worst yet." The data: `beatPhase01` wraps every beat (grid locked 171 BPM), the CPU band counters and light intensities advance — **yet the GPU image is frozen.** The single slot-8 `MTLBuffer` (known-good) was UMA-coherent and delivered the latest state to the GPU every frame; `f5ad0e2`'s 3-slot ring + per-frame rebind does not, so the GPU reads stale slot-8 → cells/lights freeze while a slot-0 (`FeatureVector`) beat term still pulses. The "race" the triple-buffer fixed was never observed; it fixed a non-problem and created a real one.

**Action (2026-06-27):** reverted both BUG-063 fix attempts — `f5ad0e2` (triple-buffer) and the layered warmup gate — restoring `LumenPatternEngine` + its tests to the exact known-good `cb8cb0b` state (single `patternBuffer`, bound once at `applyPreset`, written each `tick()`). BUG-016 palette test preserved; `LUMEN_DIAG` instrument kept for the confirm. ✅ engine build + 31 Lumen suites + app build + lint 0. **Resolution (2026-06-29):** the revert restored known-good Lumen; the residual local-file freeze was root-caused + fixed under **BUG-064** (the cell-step wrap detector missed coarse-cadence beat phases) and Matt live-confirmed it ("looks good" / "much better"), with the frozen-stem-warmup follow-up closed under LM.5. The `LUMEN_DIAG` instrument is removed (`17ebfe5`). BUG-063 closed as subsumed by BUG-064 — no separate confirm outstanding.

#### Expected behavior
Lumen Mosaic renders and animates its lit Voronoi-cell field continuously from the moment it becomes active, like every other certified preset — including the first ~10 s before the live stem analyzer converges.

#### Actual behavior
For the first ~10 s it shows a static (but correct and colourful) mosaic — the four lights and the cell colours do not change — then "unfreezes" the instant the live stem analyzer converges. Switching away earlier (Matt's usual reaction) makes it look like a permanent freeze that "recovers on switch-away." No crash, no UI hang.

#### Reproduction steps
Select Lumen Mosaic within the first ~10 s of a track (e.g. by cycling presets to it) and dwell. Session `2026-06-27T18-37-39Z`: Lumen active from ~18:38:00; the engine intensities are frozen at `[0.25 0.43 0.51 0.36]` for f=30–180 and start tracking audio at f=210 as the live stems arrive.

#### Session artifacts
`stems.csv` (`…T18-37-39Z`): `drumsEnergyRel`/`bassEnergyRel`/`vocalsEnergyRel`/`otherEnergyRel` are byte-identical (`0.24872, 0.43455, 0.51175, 0.35835`) for the first **613 stem-frames (~10 s)**, then vary. `session.log` `LUMEN_DIAG`: the four light intensities equal those frozen stem values **exactly**, frozen f=30–180, then track audio from f=210. Matt's Xcode GPU capture: a fully-composited, correct Voronoi mosaic (1800×1200) at 553 µs — a working render of *static content*, not a broken/black/collapsed one.

#### Failure class
`pipeline-wiring` — the D-019 warmup gate trusts stem *magnitude* (`totalStemEnergy`) as a proxy for stem *liveness*; a loud-but-frozen cached snapshot passes the proxy and is treated as live.

#### Ruled out (with evidence)
- **Slot-8 buffer race** — still froze with the triple-buffer fix (`f5ad0e2`) active; the buffer *contents* (stems) were frozen, not the buffer binding.
- **GPU ray-march collapse** — the GPU capture shows a correct full mosaic; ~0.88 ms is normal for Lumen's audio-static geometry, and the lighting/post passes are non-zero.
- **Headless flash harness** — renders Lumen fine because it drives *varying* synthetic features and never the frozen warmup snapshot; the bug needs the real cached-stem warmup path.
- **Loop / audio / camera / governor / dolly** — frame counter advances, `features.csv` flows, camera/`cam_t`/aspect/FOV constant, `cameraDollySpeed` 0, governor step-mult ≤0.75 (all unrelated to a frozen stem input).

#### Verification criteria (met by the fix, pending live)
Automated: `test_bug063_notLiveStems_driveFVFallback_notFrozenSnapshot` (loud frozen snapshot + `stemsLive:false` + a varying FV → the drums light tracks the FV, Δ>0.3, instead of pinning at the frozen 0.5) and `test_bug063_liveStems_stillUseStemDirect` (the fix does not strand Lumen on the fallback after convergence). Manual (required): Matt dwells on Lumen Mosaic from track start for ≥10 s live with no freeze.

### BUG-062 — Nimbus (and Aurora Veil) freeze: direct-fragment presets with `"passes": []` are skipped by the BUG-061 empty-passes guard (regression) (2026-06-26)

**P1** · renderer / regression · **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-26 — Matt live-confirmed (session `2026-06-26T21-07-18Z`: "all presets appear now"); `6848118` on origin/main.** Introduced by the BUG-061 fix (`00b0625`). Files to §Resolved at the next pruning pass.

#### Expected behavior
Advancing to Nimbus (or Aurora Veil) renders and animates the preset with the music, like every other preset.

#### Actual behavior
Selecting Nimbus leaves the *previous* preset's last frame frozen on screen; Nimbus never displays. It "unfreezes" only on switching to the next/previous preset. No crash, no error. Observed across several of Matt's recent sessions.

#### Reproduction steps
Deterministic: start a session, advance to Nimbus (or Aurora Veil) — the drawable stops updating until you switch away. Session `2026-06-26T20-28-03Z`: `preset → Nimbus` logged 4×, each bounced to Nebula ~2–4 s later.

#### Session artifacts
`session.log` shows the four `preset → Nimbus` transitions with **zero** Metal/pipeline/exception lines — a silent non-present, not a crash. Discriminator: of all sidecars, only `Nimbus.json` and `AuroraVeil.json` ship `"passes": []`; every preset that rendered fine has ≥1 pass.

#### Suspected failure class
`regression` (render-state).

#### Root cause
BUG-061 wrapped the previously-unconditional `renderFrame(...)` in `draw(in:)` with `if willRenderActiveFrame` (`!activePasses.isEmpty`) to skip the transient preset-apply swap window, on the stated premise "every applied preset has non-empty passes." Nimbus and Aurora Veil are direct-fragment presets (`fragment_function` + `"passes": []`); `applyPreset` republishes `setActivePasses(desc.passes)` = `setActivePasses([])`, so their `activePasses` is *permanently* empty → `willRenderActiveFrame` permanently false → `renderFrame`/`drawDirect` never runs → the drawable is never presented. The headless render harnesses call `renderFrame` directly (bypassing `draw(in:)`'s guard), so the regression escaped CI.

#### Fix (2026-06-26)
`PresetDescriptor` decode normalises an explicit empty `passes` array to `[.direct]` — identical to omitting the key (the existing `renderPassDefaultIsDirect` contract). This keeps `activePasses` non-empty for direct presets (restoring the guard's premise) while leaving BUG-061 fully intact (`applyPreset`'s mid-swap `setActivePasses([])` still yields empty → still skipped). Render output byte-identical (`[.direct]` resolves to the same `drawDirect` path; PresetRegression goldens for Nimbus + Aurora Veil non-drift).

#### Verification criteria
Automated: `renderPassExplicitEmptyArrayNormalisesToDirect` (`"passes": []` → `[.direct]`) + corpus guard `shippedPresets_neverDecodeToEmptyPasses` (no sidecar may decode to empty passes — the test that would have caught this); PresetRegression 4/4 (Nimbus + Aurora Veil hashes unchanged); app 388; lint 0. **Manual (required):** Matt's live confirm that Nimbus + Aurora Veil render and animate with no freeze — a render fix is code-complete, not resolved, until live M7.

### BUG-061 — Nacre crashes on load: a preset-apply race renders its `.rgba16Float` direct pipeline to the 8-bit drawable (the deterministic BUG-060 reproducer) (2026-06-25)

**Severity:** P1 (hard crash; narrow trigger — the uncertified Nacre preset reachable via the Cmd+] dev cycle / "show uncertified presets", AND a Debug build with Metal validation on).
**Domain tag:** renderer / render-state (concurrency: a preset-apply race surfacing as a render-pipeline attachment-format mismatch).
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-25 (NACRE.2b). Diagnosed from the code (the `applyPreset` publish ordering + the off-main display-link draw + the per-field locks); the live crash has no `.ips`/stack and is validation-gated, so it is not headless-reproducible.
**Introduced:** NACRE.2b for the deterministic Nacre crash (the `.rgba16Float` feedback opt-in made the latent race fatal); the underlying race is **pre-existing** (= BUG-060, the intermittent Gossamer render-death).
**Resolved:** 2026-06-25, NACRE.2b fix commit (this increment).

**Expected:** switching to any preset (incl. Nacre) renders a frame; never crashes.

**Actual (session `2026-06-25T20-51-58Z`):** Matt cycled presets with Cmd+] (Arachne → … → Murmuration, all fine) and the app crashed exactly at `preset → Nacre`. `applyPreset` (main thread) clears `activePasses` to `[]` (`VisualizerEngine+Presets:117`), publishes the new preset's direct pipeline (`:150`, `nacre_fragment`, `.rgba16Float`), and republishes `activePasses` only at the very end (`:721`). `draw(in:)` runs concurrently on MTKView's CVDisplayLink thread (hence the `pipelineLock`/`passesLock`/`mvWarpLock`). A frame in the `117→721` window reads **empty passes + the new `.rgba16Float` direct pipeline** → `renderFrame`'s pass loop matches nothing → falls to `drawDirect`, which renders that pipeline **to the 8-bit drawable** → attachment-format mismatch → GPU abort (Metal-validation-gated; the Debug build has validation on). 8-bit presets (DB/FM/Gossamer/Murmuration) render their direct fragment harmlessly in that window — a benign stray frame (the intermittent **BUG-060**). Only Nacre's `.rgba16Float` direct pipeline → 8-bit drawable hard-crashes, deterministically.

**★ Diagnosis-process note:** my FIRST diagnosis blamed the reduced-motion path (`drawMVWarpReducedMotion` has the same direct→drawable mismatch). That was an **unverified assumption** — I inferred "reduce motion is on" from the crash path without checking. Matt confirmed Reduce Motion was OFF (Accessibility → Motion), falsifying it. The reduced-motion mismatch is a real *latent* bug (fixed too, secondary) but was NOT this session's trigger. Lesson: do not assert a root cause from an inferred precondition without confirming the precondition.

**Reproduction steps:** Debug build (Metal validation on); Cmd+] to Nacre. Crashes on the first Nacre frame (deterministic). The benign 8-bit form (BUG-060) is intermittent on any preset switch under load.

**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-25T20-51-58Z/` (`session.log` ends at `preset → Nacre`; no `.ips`). `cmd.error` is **nil** for the 16-float→8-bit mismatch without validation (`test_directPipelineToDrawableFormat` — removed; documented here) → the crash needs the Debug validation layer.

**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency` (preset-apply race) surfacing as `render-state` (attachment-format mismatch).

**Fix:** `RenderPipeline.draw(in:)` skips the frame while `activePasses` is empty (`willRenderActiveFrame`) — empty passes only ever exists transiently mid-swap, so skipping is correct (MTKView holds the last frame for the ~ms of the swap). Fixes Nacre's crash **and** the BUG-060 class for every preset. Secondary: `renderNacreReducedMotion` fixes the same mismatch on the (off-this-session) reduced-motion path.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Regression: `NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest.test_emptyActivePasses_skipsRenderFrame` (the skip-condition the guard keys on) + `test_reducedMotion_…`; PresetRegression byte-identical; Nacre suite green under `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1`.
- [ ] **Manual (Matt):** Cmd+] to Nacre renders without crashing (and watch for BUG-060 non-recurrence on other preset switches).

**Manual validation required:** Yes — the live crash is validation + drawable gated (not headless-reproducible); Matt's live re-test is the confirmation.

### BUG-059 — Concurrent `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` start/stop ABBA-deadlocks: `scheduleFile` re-scheduled inline from the completion handler vs `player.stop()` (BUG-021 family) (2026-06-17)

**Severity:** P1 (a hang — the provider's lifecycle thread and AVFoundation's completion-handler queue both wedge permanently; in production this freezes audio/visuals with no recovery).
**Domain tag:** local-file / concurrency (`LocalFilePlaybackProvider.scheduleFileLoop` / `teardownAVFoundation` / `handleConfigurationChange`)
**Status:** **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-18** — fix `a285a22` (integrated to `main`, origin/main); Matt's live validation 2026-06-18 (session `2026-06-18T13-46-10Z`): several Duet 3 ↔ Mac-mini output-device swaps mid local-file playback, **no hang** every time, Next/Prev clean. Root cause confirmed from a live `sample` of the hung process (stack below). Surfaced 2026-06-17 while de-flaking `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` (the "load flake" was this deadlock firing intermittently, not a wall-clock budget slip).
**Introduced:** The LF.1 spike — `scheduleFileLoop` re-schedules `scheduleFile()` synchronously from inside the AVAudioPlayerNode completion handler; `handleConfigurationChange` (LF.1, `:414`) added the off-MainActor `stop()+start()` restart that supplies the concurrency. The BUG-021 fix (2026-05-28) moved teardown outside the *provider's* `NSLock`, but this cycle is on AVFoundation's *internal* locks, which that fix does not cover.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-18 — `a285a22` (fix) + Matt's manual no-hang validation (session `2026-06-18T13-46-10Z`). Integrated to `main` (origin/main).

### Expected behavior
Two overlapping start/stop sequences on one provider (e.g. an `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` restart racing a track advance) serialize and complete; the provider ends in a clean stopped or playing state. No thread blocks indefinitely.

### Actual behavior
The pair deadlocks permanently. Observed on this machine 2026-06-17: the REVIEW.2 regression test `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` hung **6 m 15 s** (killed) with its watchdog removed, and **fails at round 0** (watchdog fires at 8.03 s) with the watchdog intact. A **single** sequential `engine.start()` is healthy (`routerChurn_startStopLocalFilePlayback_neverHangs` passes, 4.36 s) — only the **concurrent** path wedges. It is a race, so intermittent: it passed in isolation on other days (~3.6 s) and "failed once after ~9.5 s under the full parallel suite" (2026-06-17) — both are this same deadlock, triggering or not depending on timing.

The circular wait (from `sample` of the hung `swiftpm-testing-helper`, 1508/1508 samples each side — i.e. fully wedged, not slow):
- **Thread A** (`provider.stop()`): `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.stop()` (`:186`) → `teardownAVFoundation` (`:320`) → `-[AVAudioPlayerNode stop]` → `AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl::StopImpl()` → `_dispatch_sync_f_slow` → `__DISPATCH_WAIT_FOR_QUEUE__` → blocked waiting to own the **AVAudioPlayerNode CompletionHandlerQueue** (and `Stop()` holds the engine lock).
- **Thread B** (`AVAudioPlayerNodeImpl.CompletionHandlerQueue`): running our `closure #1 in scheduleFileLoop` (`LocalFilePlaybackProvider.swift:355`) → `-[AVAudioPlayerNode scheduleFile:atTime:completionHandler:]` → `AVAudioNodeImplBase::GetAttachAndEngineLock()` → `std::recursive_mutex::lock()` → `__psynch_mutexwait` — blocked on the **AVAudioEngine attach/engine lock**.

A holds the engine lock + wants the completion queue; B holds the completion queue + wants the engine lock. The provider's own `NSLock` is **not** in the cycle.

### Reproduction steps
1. `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` (real `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` + `love_rehab.m4a` excerpt; race, so re-run a few times — currently wedges on the first round on the dev Mac mini).
2. To capture the stack: run it, then `pgrep -f "swiftpm-testing-helper.*concurrentDoubleStart" | while read p; do sample "$p" 2 -mayDie > /tmp/s_$p.txt; done`, and read the `CompletionHandlerQueue` + `provider.stop()` threads.
3. Production shape: during local-file playback, fire an `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` (switch the default output device / sample rate) — `handleConfigurationChange` (`:414`) runs `stop()+start()` on a global queue, off the MainActor — at the same time as a track advance (`VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift:335`, MainActor `stop()+start()`).

**Minimum reproducer:** the existing `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` test (real audio, no synthetic — per FA #27).

### Session artifacts
n/a — not a session defect; the artifact is the process stack `sample` above (captured 2026-06-17, not retained; reproducible per step 2). No `features.csv`/`session.log` involvement.

### Suspected failure class
`concurrency`.

**Evidence for this class:** a two-thread circular lock-acquire (AVFoundation completion-handler dispatch queue ⇄ AVAudioEngine attach/engine `recursive_mutex`) visible in the process sample; the single-threaded path does not wedge.

### Verification criteria
Written before the fix (per template). When resolved, all of:
- [x] `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` passes reliably — **11/11 green (6× isolated + 5× in-suite), ~3.5 s each**, on the same dev Mac mini that wedged on round 0 before the fix. (A fresh `sample` is no longer meaningful — the process no longer hangs; the 6-min-hang → 3.5 s-pass swing on a reliably-wedging machine is the proof the cycle is gone.)
- [x] No regression in the REVIEW.2 siblings: full `SessionLifecycleChurnTests` suite **5/5 green (all 6 tests), ~17 s each** — `routerChurn_…`, `completionCallbackVsStop_…`, `onFileEnded_queueAdvanceChurn_…`, `transportChurn_…`, `deinitWhilePlaying_…` included.
- [x] Full engine `swift test` with no recurrence — closeout 2026-06-17 (`a285a22`): **1512 tests, 0 failures** under full parallel load (the exact condition the original intermittent failure needed); app 388 ✓, swiftlint 0/433, doc gates 10/10 — ALL GREEN.
- [x] **Manual (Matt, 2026-06-18, session `2026-06-18T13-46-10Z`):** several output-device swaps mid local-file playback — **no hang** (every `provider.teardown` reached EXIT; every `player.stop BEGIN → COMPLETE`); **Next/Prev** advance cleanly (`advanceLocalFileQueue EXIT ok=true`); `features.csv` live throughout (60 fps, 200/200 distinct values in the last 200 rows — no freeze). **NB** the swaps were sequential (seconds apart), so the session did **not** reproduce the exact *concurrent* race — the automated test (11/11, reliably wedged pre-fix) is the proof for the race; this session confirms the device-swap path is healthy + un-regressed. The track restarting from the top on a swap is the separate, expected **BUG-056** (device-change restart has no resume-from-position), **not** a BUG-059 regression — `handleConfigurationChange` restarts the engine from position 0 by design.

**Manual validation required:** Yes — session-lifecycle + playback-loop behavior change. Needs a live local-file session; the worktree change must reach the `main` build first (or Matt builds the worktree) before the live test.

### Fix (step 2 — 2026-06-17)
`scheduleFileLoop`'s completion handler no longer re-schedules `scheduleFile()` (or fires `onFileEnded`) **inline** on the AVAudioPlayerNode completion-handler queue. It now hops that work onto a provider-owned serial `rescheduleQueue` and re-checks the `(playerNode, audioFile)` identity under `lock` there before touching the player. The completion handler returns immediately, freeing the completion queue — so a concurrent `stop()` (whose `player.stop()` holds the engine lock and `dispatch_sync`s that queue) is no longer blocked by an inline `scheduleFile()` waiting on the engine lock. The two sides now serialize on the engine lock (mutual exclusion) instead of forming a cycle. `onFileEnded`'s production consumer already re-dispatches to the MainActor (`VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift:161`), so its callback thread change is immaterial; LF.1 single-file looping restarts at a file boundary where a sub-millisecond hop is inaudible. Test-only files untouched; the existing REVIEW.2 watchdog test is the regression net (it reliably reproduced the deadlock pre-fix).

### Fix scope
Contained to `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.scheduleFileLoop`: hop the re-schedule (and the `onFileEnded` advance) **off** the AVAudioPlayerNode completion-handler queue onto a provider-owned serial queue, re-checking `stillActive` under the lock before touching the player. That frees the completion queue immediately, so a concurrent `player.stop()` can no longer find it occupied-and-blocked-on-the-engine-lock. Changes the callback thread and the loop re-schedule timing → not a < 5-line trivial collapse; proper fix increment + regression + manual validation.

### Related
- **BUG-021** — the parent ABBA class (provider `NSLock` vs AVFoundation render/completion thread). This is the same family on AVFoundation's *internal* locks, which the BUG-021 fix did not reach.
- **BUG-056** (local-file restarts from the top on a device change) — same `handleConfigurationChange` restart path; a fix here should be coordinated with any resume-from-position work there.
- **G1 / CLEAN.1.5 / BUG-058** — the device-swap scenario is one production trigger (config change during local-file playback).
- Test: `SessionLifecycleChurnTests.concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` (REVIEW.2). Failed Approach #27 (real audio, not synthetic) — why the test drives the real provider.

### BUG-057 — Cold tap install delivers persistent silence on streaming audio; only a manual output-device switch (tap reinstall) recovers it (2026-06-17)

**Severity:** P1 (the core streaming-visualization flow does not work on a cold start — visuals stay motionless with live Spotify audio — and the only recovery is a manual output-device toggle no user would discover).
**Domain tag:** audio.capture
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-17 (Matt) — Phosphene-side complete (D-165).** The silent-tap family is closed: the detector card (`a0a9ded`), the reinstall fix (don't rebuild a working tap on a pause — `6bac999`, validated 3/3 clean pause/resume), and the card pause-suppression (`cf44b1b`, validated) all shipped + validated + pushed. The only residual is the *environmental* wedged-`coreaudiod` (a `killall coreaudiod` / reboot workaround — NOT a Phosphene code bug), which the detector now surfaces with actionable guidance instead of a silent flatline. The original diagnosis below (environmental daemon wedge) stands; the actionable Phosphene-side work is done. (Earlier interim status: "Diagnosed — root cause environmental"; the detector + reinstall-fix arc landed 2026-06-17.)
**Introduced:** Not a Phosphene regression. macOS audio-daemon state degraded over a 15-day `coreaudiod` uptime on a box with heavy virtual-device churn (BlackHole, Teams audio device, Apogee Duet, repeated aggregate-device creation). Earlier healthy sessions (`project_streaming_tap_signal_health`: −6 dBFS) predate the wedge.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-17 (Matt's call to close) — detector + reinstall-fix + card pause-suppression all validated (D-165; commits `a0a9ded` / `6bac999` / `cf44b1b`, on `origin`). The environmental wedged-`coreaudiod` residual is a `killall coreaudiod` / reboot workaround (not a code bug), now surfaced by the card. Full evidence in the §Reinstall fix (steps 1–4) + §Card pause-suppression sections below.

---

### Expected behavior

On a cold start — connect Spotify → load playlist → Phosphene signals ready → user presses play in Spotify — the system-audio tap captures the live output and visuals animate within a few seconds, with no manual intervention. A silent tap should be auto-recovered by the existing `.silent → reinstall` state machine.

### Actual behavior

The tap installs (`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` returns `noErr`, `raw tap capture started sr=… Hz` logs) but delivers **persistent silence** — `features.csv` mid/treble = exactly 0.0, `signal quality → red: no signal`, `audio signal → silent`. The existing `.silent → scheduleNextReinstall` recovery does **not** rescue it (silent for the full session in 4 of 5 sessions). The ONLY thing that recovers it is a **manual output-device switch**: in session `2026-06-17T01-51-11Z` the tap was silent for ~75 s, then at the instant the default output device changed (rate flipped 48 k → 44.1 k → `performReinstall`) it captured **~5.6 s of real music** (mid up to 0.527, treble 0.106, `signal quality → green: peak -0 dBFS — OK`). So the audio is tappable; the *cold-install* tap is the one that comes up dead.

Ruled out: output routing (silent on both the Apogee Duet 3 and built-in Mac-mini speakers); signing (proper `Apple Development` cert, Team `2LBTN9PB4Z`, not ad-hoc); Screen Recording permission (granted, toggled off/on + relaunched; `NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription` present); audio actually playing (audible through the Duet 3); the engine/render path (local-file playback animates normally — file-direct, bypasses the tap).

### Reproduction steps

1. Connect Spotify, load a playlist, let Phosphene reach ready.
2. Press play in Spotify (audible through the system output).
3. Observe: visuals motionless; `session.log` shows `raw tap capture started` then `audio signal → silent`; `features.csv` mid/treble = 0.
4. With Phosphene running + audio playing, switch the system output device (System Settings → Sound → Output → another device, then back).
5. Observe: at the switch, the tap reinstalls and motion appears (briefly green / real signal).

**Minimum reproducer:** any DRM streaming source (Spotify) on a cold start. The device-switch recovery is the discriminator.

---

### Session artifacts

**Session directories:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-17T01-37-54Z/`, `…01-48-33Z/`, `…01-51-11Z/` (+ `2026-06-16T22-10-16Z`, `22-39-46Z`).

- Silent cold-install sessions: `01-48-33Z` mean mid/treble = 0.0000 over 1658 rows; `01-37-54Z` mid/treble = 0.0000 over 1929 rows; same `signal quality → red: no signal` log line.
- Recovery session `01-51-11Z`: silent rows 0–75.7 s, then signal t=75.8 → 81.4 s (341/2548 rows mid > 0.05, max mid 0.527), `signal quality → green: peak -0 dBFS, treble 2.06% — OK`. (`max bass=29.0` at the switch instant is a reinstall-pop transient — secondary, worth a glance.)

```log
[01:49:06] raw tap capture started sr=48000 Hz ch=2
[01:49:07] signal quality → red: no signal — check output device / app is playing
[01:49:09] audio signal → silent
  --- (01-51-11Z, after a device switch) ---
[01:52:14] audio signal → active
[01:52:26] MIR analysis rate → 44100 Hz (tap 44100 Hz)
[01:52:29] signal quality → green: peak -0 dBFS, treble 2.06% — OK
```

- Code seams (the cold-vs-reinstall divergence):
  - `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/SystemAudioCapture.swift:116` `startCapture` (cold install) and `:290` `performReinstall` run the **identical** create sequence (`createProcessTap → readTapFormat → createAggregateDevice → createIOProc → startDevice`); the only difference is `performReinstall` tears down first (`teardownTapResources` `:311`) and runs later. So the divergence is timing/state, not code.
  - `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/AudioInputRouter+SignalState.swift:13` — the `.silent → scheduleNextReinstall` recovery machine ("the tap stays alive but delivers permanent silence … recovery is destroy and recreate") — present but did not recover the cold install.
  - `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/SilenceDetector.swift:4` — "Core Audio process taps succeed even when playing **DRM-protected content**, but macOS silently zeros the audio buffer … the tap appears healthy while delivering silence." Spotify is DRM; this is the candidate mechanism, but the device-switch capture of real Spotify audio argues against *pure* persistent DRM-zeroing.
  - `PhospheneEngine/Sources/Audio/DefaultOutputDeviceMonitor.swift` — the CLEAN.1.5/G1 monitor whose device-change callback drives the recovering `performReinstall`.

---

### Suspected failure class

**RESOLVED to `resource-management` (external OS daemon state) — see §Diagnosis.** A wedged `coreaudiod` fed every process tap silence; none of the four pre-diagnosis candidates below held (the diagnosis falsified all of them — see §Diagnosis). Retained for the record:

> ~~`pipeline-wiring`~~ — Candidate root causes considered during diagnosis: (a) Screen Recording grant not yet effective on the first tap; (b) DRM-zeroing the cold tap escapes; (c) cold tap binds before audio flows; (d) auto-reinstall delays/attempt-cap or same-device reinstall insufficient. **All four falsified:** a separate granted binary (`audio-tap-test`) was equally silent (kills a + d), on non-DRM audio (kills b), on a freshly-bound tap on two devices (kills c) — until `coreaudiod` was restarted.

---

### Verification criteria

- [ ] Instrumentation (step 1): a session captures, for both cold install and any reinstall, the tap RMS over the first N seconds, whether/when `.silent → reinstall` fires, the device id + rate, and the Screen-Recording preflight state at install — enough to separate the four candidate causes.
- [ ] Manual (the real gate): a **cold start** with live Spotify animates within ~5 s with **no manual device toggle** — `features.csv` mid/treble > 0, `signal quality → green` — across ≥ 2 sessions.
- [ ] No regression: local-file playback still animates; the CLEAN.1.5/G1 device-swap recovery still works (switch output mid-session → stays live).

**Manual validation required:** Yes — the tap path is not SPM-testable (real Core Audio + a DRM streaming source). Listen/look: cold-start Spotify → motion without touching the output device.

---

### Instrumentation (step 1 — landed 2026-06-17, instrument → STOP)

Added to `session.log` (grep `TAP:`) so the four candidates above are separable from ONE real cold-start Spotify session:

- **Per (re)install:** `install via startCapture` / `reinstall via device-change` + `gen=N defaultOutputDevice=<id> rate=<Hz> screenRecordingPreflight=<bool>` (`SystemAudioCapture.armInstallProbeAndLog`). Discriminates same-device vs different-device reinstall (candidate d) and pins the preflight at install (candidate a).
- **First-10 s RMS probe:** `tap RMS gen=N t=+Xs rms=… peak=…` at ~1 Hz from the IO proc (`SystemAudioCapture.probeInstallRMS`) — shows whether THIS tap delivered signal or stayed zero (candidates b, c). Correlate with the existing `audio signal → …` transitions + `signal quality → …` lines.
- **Reinstall scheduler timeline:** the `.silent → reinstall` lines (scheduled/attempt#/skipped/succeeded/failed/exhausted), previously os_log-only (`AudioInputRouter+SignalState`, mirrored via `onAudioCaptureDiagnostic`).

Wired `SystemAudioCapture.onCaptureDiagnostic` → `AudioInputRouter.onAudioCaptureDiagnostic` → `SessionRecorder.log` in `VisualizerEngine+Audio.setupAudioRouting`. New protocol member `AudioCapturing.onCaptureDiagnostic`. No fix code; no behaviour change (FA #73 — reuses the existing reinstall machine + `DefaultOutputDeviceMonitor`). Regression: 2 routing-lock tests in `AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests`. **Diagnose next (step 2):** Matt runs an instrumented cold-start session + a device switch; identify the holding candidate(s) and record the root cause here. Build from the PRIMARY checkout with Screen Recording granted (`project_canonical_app_screenrecording`) — a fresh worktree build re-churns the grant and reproduces *unrelated* silence (don't conflate it with this bug). Commit: see `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-17-041554]`.

### Diagnosis (step 2 — 2026-06-17, CONFIRMED: wedged `coreaudiod`)

The instrumented cold-start session (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-17T13-29-13Z/`) + a standalone cross-check pinned the root cause to **macOS audio-daemon state, not Phosphene**:

1. **Instrumentation (PhospheneApp).** All 4 installs — cold `startCapture` gen=1 + the three `.silent`-recovery reinstalls gen=2/3/4 — logged `defaultOutputDevice=128 rate=48000 screenRecordingPreflight=true`, and the first-10 s RMS probe read `rms=0.000000 peak=0.000000` on **every** one. The `.silent → reinstall` machine fired correctly (attempt #1/#2/#3 → backoff exhausted). `raw_tap.wav` = −inf; `features.csv` 0/7721 rows nonzero. So: the recovery code works; every tap was simply fed silence. No `reinstall via device-change` fired (the manual "source change" was not a macOS *default-output* change — device stayed 128).
2. **Decisive cross-check.** `tools/audio-tap-test` (a **separate binary**, its own `audio_tap` Screen-Recording grant, identical `CATapDescription(stereoGlobalTapButExcludeProcesses:[])`) **also** captured pure-zero — on Spotify (DRM), on `say`/`afplay` (non-DRM, `afplay` confirmed running), on **both** Duet 3 *and* built-in Mac-mini Speakers. ⇒ not app-specific (rules out stale-grant/BUG-055), not DRM, not the device.
3. **The proof.** `coreaudiod` had been up **15 days 20 h** (`ps -o etime`), no orphaned aggregate devices. **`sudo killall coreaudiod` → the same tool immediately captured real audio** (RMS to 0.31 / −10 dB, 47 Hz-dominant music spectrum). Single-variable flip.

The `01-51-11Z` "device-switch recovery" (≈5.6 s then degraded) was a coincidental partial nudge to the same wedged daemon, not a Phosphene fix. **Failure class corrected: `resource-management` (external OS daemon state) — not `pipeline-wiring`.**

### Fix scope

**No Phosphene code fix is needed for the silence itself** — the tap path is correct (it captures the instant `coreaudiod` is healthy). **Workaround: `sudo killall coreaudiod`** (daemon auto-relaunches, ~1 s audio blip) or reboot. The one worthwhile Phosphene-side increment is the **granted-but-silent detector** (shared with BUG-055): when the tap is installed + `screenRecordingPreflight=true` but RMS ≈ 0 for N s while a session is "playing," surface an actionable state ("audio isn't reaching the tap — restart audio with `sudo killall coreaudiod`, check Screen Recording, check output device") instead of a silent "ready" flatline. The step-1 instrumentation's `TAP:` RMS probe is exactly the signal that detector consumes. **Awaiting Matt's go to scope it as the fix increment.** Kickoff: `docs/prompts/BUG-057_TAP_COLD_INSTALL_SILENCE_KICKOFF.md`.

### Fix increment — silent-tap detector landed 2026-06-17 (pending Matt's manual UX validation)

The *detector half* is implemented (this surfaces the silence; it does NOT fix the environmental cause — `sudo killall coreaudiod` remains the cure). `PlaybackErrorBridge` (`PhospheneApp/Services/PlaybackErrorBridge.swift`) now runs a ~1 Hz freshness poll while playing and raises a prominent **`AudioStallOverlayView`** card when *no fresh audio* reaches the visualizer for ~10 s. "Fresh" = the tap frame count is still advancing AND the signal isn't confirmed `.silent`, so it catches **both** failure modes the family presents: **Mode A** (RMS≈0 → `.silent`; wedged `coreaudiod` [this bug] / stale grant [BUG-055]) via `audioSignalState`, and **Mode B** (frozen IO-proc; BUG-058) via `InputLevelMonitor.frameCount` ceasing to advance — Mode B keeps RMS nonzero so `.silent` never fires and an RMS-only detector would miss it. The card carries the fix ladder (`sudo killall coreaudiod`; re-grant Screen & System Audio Recording + relaunch; check the output device) and auto-clears when audio returns; it supersedes the existing 15 s silence toast while up. Gated on `.playing && !paused` (with a freshness baseline reset on gate entry) so it never false-fires pre-play, in `.ready`, on a deliberate local-file pause, or during quiet passages. 8 new gate tests (`PlaybackStallDetectorTests` in `PlaybackErrorBridgeTests`) lock the four false-fire guards + both modes + auto-clear; all green. **Reuses `PlaybackErrorBridge` per FA #73 — no parallel detector, zero engine changes.** Commit: see `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` (`a0a9ded`). **Surface VALIDATED 2026-06-17** — Matt's screenshot confirms the card renders correctly (headline, body, the 3-step fix ladder, the `sudo killall coreaudiod` pill, the auto-clear hint) with the right copy. The gate (no false-fire) and auto-clear are unit-proven (`PlaybackStallDetectorTests`, `test_recovery_clearsCard`); the **live** pause→card→resume→clear cycle can't be demonstrated until the BUG-057 reinstall hang is fixed (today the tap never recovers — see §Validation note + `docs/prompts/BUG-057_TAP_REINSTALL_SILENCE_KICKOFF.md`). **Detector half DONE.**

**Card APPROVED 2026-06-17 (Matt)** as the safety-net surface — copy/paths correct. **Product direction (Matt):** the end-state must NOT make the user touch Terminal or System Settings; the manual fix-ladder is a developer/last-resort fallback, not the fix. The user-friendly answer is the app **self-healing** — the BUG-057 reinstall auto-recovery (scoped; makes the common reinstall-hang recover with zero user action → no card at all) + stable signing (CLEAN.2.5b; removes the re-grant step for end users). No quick fix clears that bar (the Terminal step needs root; deep-linking the Settings panes only speeds the same manual work), so the card ships as-is and the leverage is the self-healing fix. See `feedback_self_healing_over_manual_remediation` (memory).

### Validation note 2026-06-17 — detector verified correct against a real session; BUG-057 reproduced live via a streaming pause

Matt's session `2026-06-17T16-59-43Z` (validating via a Spotify pause) **confirmed the detector is correct** and surfaced a more reproducible BUG-057 trigger than the 15-day `coreaudiod` wedge. Timeline: tap healthy 50 s (`signal quality → green -6 dBFS`, RMS 0.02–0.10) → **pause** → `audio signal → suspect → silent` → the existing `.silent → reinstall` machine fired (`TAP: Tap reinstall scheduled in 3.0s (attempt #1) → starting`) → **the reinstalled tap came up silent** (no `→ active`, no post-reinstall RMS probe, `features.csv` all-zero for the final ~150 s). The card appeared at ~15 s and **correctly stayed up** because audio genuinely never returned — the visualizer had no signal. NOT a detector bug: `InputLevelMonitor.frameCount` is monotonic (its `reset()` is never called in production — only in `InputLevelMonitorTests`), so the freshness poll has no backwards-counter hazard, and `test_recovery_clearsCard` proves the auto-clear path fires when fresh audio resumes.

### Reinstall fix — step 1 (instrument) landed 2026-06-17

Defect Protocol step 1 for the reinstall-comes-up-silent facet (kickoff `docs/prompts/BUG-057_TAP_REINSTALL_SILENCE_KICKOFF.md`). The `.silent → reinstall` path (`AudioInputRouter+SignalState.performTapReinstall` → `SystemAudioCapture.stopCapture()` then `startCapture()`) had **no per-step breadcrumbs** — session `16-59-43Z` logged `Tap reinstall #1 starting` then nothing (no `install via startCapture gen=2`, no `succeeded`/`failed`), so the recreate hung but the stalling call was unknown. Added per-step `session.log` breadcrumbs (via the existing `onCaptureDiagnostic` sink) mirroring the device-change `performReinstall`: `stopCapture: ENTER → cleanup` / `cleanup done`, then `startCapture: ENTER → createProcessTap` / `tap created → …createAggregateDevice` / `aggregate created → createIOProc` / `IO proc created → startDevice` / `startDevice done → start deviceMonitor`. The **last breadcrumb before silence pins the exact hanging Core Audio call**; also instruments the cold install (same `startCapture`). Engine build green, swiftlint 0; no test (breadcrumb-only on the non-SPM-testable capture path — same precedent as BUG-058's instrument step). **Step 2 (diagnose):** Matt runs an instrumented pause→resume streaming session (build from PRIMARY, Screen Recording granted); from the breadcrumbs identify the stalling call + whether the reinstalled tap *hangs* vs *comes up silent*, and reconcile with BUG-058 (likely shared root). No fix code yet. `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-17-174055]`.

### Reinstall fix — step 3 (fix) + step 4 (validate) ✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-17

Implements the step-2 conclusion: the `.silent → reinstall` machine no longer rebuilds a tap that was **already delivering** audio (a user pause) — it only reinstalls a tap that **never delivered** (a genuinely broken cold install: stale Screen-Recording grant / wedged daemon). Mechanism:
- `SilenceDetector` gains `hasEverDetectedSignal` (latched on the first non-silent buffer) + `resetSignalHistory()`.
- `AudioInputRouter.start(mode:)` resets the latch each session.
- `AudioInputRouter+SignalState.scheduleNextReinstall` returns early (logs `Tap reinstall SKIPPED — session has had audio … user pause`) when `hasEverDetectedSignal`.

This removes the pause-churn and the dead-tap lottery: a paused source's working tap is left alone and resumes on play; **the silent-tap detector card (which still appears on a > dwell silence) now AUTO-CLEARS on resume** because the tap stays alive (it couldn't in 16-59-43Z — the freeze is fixed). Preserves BUG-055 / wedged-daemon recovery (a never-delivered cold install still reinstalls). **Tradeoff:** a tap that delivered then died *for real* mid-session is treated as a pause and not auto-recovered — rare; the reinstall was unreliable for it anyway, and the card surfaces it. Tests: 3 new in `AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` (fires-when-never-had-audio / skips-when-had-audio / reset-clears-latch); also fixed a latent `TestClock` unowned-capture crash the new test exposed. Engine build green, swiftlint 0, signal-state + SilenceDetector suites green; full closeout `EVIDENCE: ALL GREEN` (engine 1494 / app 385 / lint 0 / docgates 10, commit `2f533cf`). `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-17-180919]`.

**RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (fix commit `6bac999`)** — Matt validated in session `2026-06-17T18-16-41Z`: **3 pause/resume cycles, all recovered cleanly**, each logging `Tap reinstall SKIPPED — … user pause` and **zero reinstall churn** (no `scheduled` / `starting` / `stopCapture:` / `startCapture: ENTER` during the pauses — only the cold `gen=1` install). The **same `gen=1` tap survived all three pauses and resumed** (`audio signal → active` ×3), confirming the one open assumption (a working tap resumes on its own after a pause — previously unobserved because the reinstall always destroyed it first). `features.csv` 6077/10662 rows nonzero, healthy tail. **Remaining (separate) UX question — RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (Matt chose suppress-on-pause; validated):** the detector card used to *appear* on a deliberate > 10 s streaming pause (it keys on silence, not on the rebuild). See §Card pause-suppression below.

### Card pause-suppression — landed 2026-06-17, pending Matt's validation

Suppresses the silent-tap card on a likely **user pause** so it only raises for a genuine break. Mechanism: the engine's `AudioInputRouter.hasEverDetectedSignal` (the same RMS latch the reinstall fix uses, reset per session) is forwarded to `VisualizerEngine.hasEverDetectedAudio` and provided to `PlaybackErrorBridge`. In `evaluateStall`, a tick is treated as a **likely pause** (don't accumulate toward the card) when: callbacks are still advancing **AND** the signal is `.silent` **AND** the session has had real audio. So:
- **Pause** (alive tap reading zeros, was delivering) → suppressed. ✓
- **Broken cold install** (never delivered → `hasEverDetectedSignal` false) → still raises the card. ✓ (BUG-055 / wedge preserved.)
- **Mode B freeze** (frozen IO-proc → callbacks NOT advancing) → still raises the card. ✓ (a real freeze is not a pause.)

Note the engine's "ever had audio" latch is RMS-based (`SilenceDetector`), NOT `audioSignalState` (which defaults `.active` and would falsely mark a broken tap as "had audio"). Files: `AudioInputRouter+SignalState` (public `hasEverDetectedSignal` forwarder), `VisualizerEngine` (`hasEverDetectedAudio`), `PlaybackErrorBridge` (provider + likely-pause gate), `PlaybackView` (wiring). +3 bridge tests (pause suppressed / never-had-audio fires / Mode-B-after-audio fires). App build green, swiftlint 0, bridge suites 18/18. `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-17-184040]`. **VALIDATED + RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (Matt):** pause streaming > 10 s → the card no longer appears (confirmed live); the never-had-audio (broken cold install) and Mode-B-freeze cases still raise it (unit-proven); card surface validated earlier by screenshot.

### Reinstall fix — step 2 (diagnose) 2026-06-17: recreate does NOT hang; the `.silent → reinstall` churns pointlessly on a user pause

Instrumented session `2026-06-17T17-45-44Z` (pause→resume ×2, **both recovered**) captured the full per-step trace:
- **The recreate never hangs.** All 4 `.silent → reinstall` attempts ran the complete `stopCapture (ENTER→cleanup→done) → startCapture (createProcessTap→aggregate→IOProc→startDevice→done) → install gen=N → succeeded` sequence in **< 1 s** each. So 16-59-43Z's "starting then silence" was NOT confirmed as a hang (it was pre-instrumentation); same code, intermittent outcome.
- **The reinstalls fire WHILE the source is paused.** On pause, `audio signal → silent` arms the reinstall (+3 s / +10 s / +30 s backoff). Each reinstall "succeeds" but the new tap reads RMS=0 — **because the source is paused, not because the tap is broken.** Recovery (`audio signal → active`) came when the source resumed and the then-current tap delivered (normal ~1–2 s warm-up, same as the cold gen=1 install). Both pauses recovered after 2 attempts, ~13 s.
- **So the pause-reinstall is pointless churn** — it destroys + recreates a tap that would have delivered fine on resume, spinning a "recreate lottery" on every pause. **16-59-43Z is one of those pause-reinstalls landing a created-but-dead tap** (intermittent; could also be a true hang, still un-instrumented-captured — the breadcrumbs will say which next time it fails).

**Leading fix (step 3 — pending Matt's nod on the behaviour, which is the product question he flagged):** stop reinstalling a tap that was **already delivering** audio before it went silent (= a user pause); only reinstall a tap that **never delivered** (= a genuinely broken cold install — BUG-055 stale grant / wedged daemon). The per-generation RMS probe already provides the "did this generation ever deliver" signal, and the gate is unit-testable in `AudioInputRouterSignalStateTests` (MockAudioCapture + SilenceDetector). This removes the churn AND the dead-tap lottery, and means a pause is harmless: the working tap simply resumes on play. (Validates Matt's "should `.silent → reinstall` fire on a user pause?" → no.) The one assumption the fix itself tests: a working tap resumes on its own after a pause — implementing it + Matt's pause/resume validation IS the confirmation (if the tap does NOT self-resume, the fix surfaces that and we add a real recovery instead).

**So a streaming pause is a contaminated way to validate the card** — pausing → sustained silence → `.silent → reinstall` → the recreated tap hits BUG-057 (comes up silent) → audio never recovers → the card can't auto-clear. Two implications: (1) until BUG-057's reinstall-comes-up-silent is fixed, **the card will fire (correctly) on every streaming pause longer than the dwell**, and the only recovery is a manual output-device switch (the known BUG-057 workaround) — a product question for Matt (longer dwell? infer deliberate pause?). (2) Validate the card's *surface* (look/copy/fade) with the new **DEBUG force-toggle (Cmd+Shift+Option+A)** instead — it shows the real `AudioStallOverlayView` on demand, decoupled from the broken tap recovery. Open question worth a separate look: should `.silent → reinstall` fire on a *user pause* at all (it destroys a working tap and the recreate comes up dead)?

- **Sibling: BUG-055** (stale Screen-Recording grant → silent tap) — same silent-tap family, **distinct root cause**: BUG-055 is permission-denied-after-resign (`CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess` stale-`true`, fixed by re-grant + relaunch); BUG-057 keeps the grant (audio IS on the tapped device) and recovers only on a device-switch reinstall.

### BUG-050 — Always-on session recorder ~doubles per-frame CPU (encode stacked on render); ungated in normal use (2026-06-14)

**Severity:** P2 (no fps/correctness impact — render alone holds ~52 % of the 60 fps frame budget and 60 fps holds; the cost is sustained extra CPU/power/heat, ~2 cores on the Mac mini, for the entire duration of every session).
**Domain tag:** resource-management / performance
**Status:** **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (`702697d`) — reframed.** The video gate landed (OFF by default; `PHOSPHENE_RECORD_VIDEO=1` to enable) and is validated on two real sessions (`2026-06-17T22-10-50Z`, `2026-06-18T13-57-23Z`): `video 0 appended`, `frame_cpu_ms` **15.78 → ~8.1 ms** — the render loop genuinely halved. **The original "Activity Monitor steady-state CPU halves" criterion was a MISDIAGNOSIS and is retired:** Activity Monitor stayed 89–115% because the dominant cost is the **continuous real-time stem separation** (the Demucs-style MPSGraph model re-running every ~5 s — 28–29× per ~3 min session) + the preset-dependent render, NOT the video. `encode_cpu_ms` (~6 ms, unchanged with video off) is the *Metal command-encode* metric — the 2026-06-14 entry mis-read it as the video-capture cost. The gate is a real, free frame-loop reduction and is kept; the leftover ~2-core cost is the live-stems feature working as designed (acceptable on the plugged-in Mac mini at 60 fps; a separate question only if laptops/battery become a target). (Diagnosed 2026-06-14; "option A" defer reversed by Matt 2026-06-17.) Surfaced when Matt's Activity Monitor read PhospheneApp at ~99–115 % during the BUG-033 validation.
**Introduced:** the SessionRecorder video-capture path; instantiated unconditionally (`VisualizerEngine.swift:785`, `SessionRecorder()` with `enabled: true` default) — no production gate.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-17 (`702697d`, video gate) — reframed: the gate IS the fix (the video tax is gone); the "halve Activity Monitor" criterion was retired as a misdiagnosis (dominant CPU = live stem separation, not the recorder). Validated sessions `22-10-50Z` + `13-57-23Z`.

**Expected:** the diagnostic session recorder adds modest overhead; it should not roughly double the app's CPU in normal use.
**Actual:** the recorder runs every session (ungated). Its per-frame `encode_cpu_ms` (~7–9 ms — drawable→pixel-buffer capture + AVAssetWriter feed) is **additive** to `renderframe_cpu_ms` (~8.6 ms): `frame_cpu_ms` ≈ encode + render ≈ 15.8 ms ≈ a full 60 fps budget → ~1 core for the frame path, plus audio/main threads → Activity Monitor ~99–115 %. Encode is on its own thread, so it does not (much) cost frame rate — render alone is ~52 % budget and 60 fps holds for 98.8 % of frames — the impact is sustained CPU/power/heat. Compounded by BUG-039 (the same recorder's video writer dying + restarting, hitting its 8/8 cap on macOS 26.5 / M2 Pro).
**Reproduction steps:** play any session; Activity Monitor shows PhospheneApp ~99 %+. Confirmed from artifacts: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-14T17-58-44Z/features.csv` — `frame_cpu_ms` mean 15.78 (encode 7.16 + render 7.10); in the two 30 s windows where the writer was dead between BUG-039 restarts, `encode_cpu_ms` → ~0.6 and total CPU halved to ~9 ms.
**Session artifacts:** `2026-06-14T17-58-44Z/features.csv` (per-frame `frame_cpu_ms` / `encode_cpu_ms` / `renderframe_cpu_ms` breakdown).
**Suspected failure class:** `resource-management`.
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Recording gated off by default with an explicit per-session enable (`PHOSPHENE_RECORD_VIDEO=1`) — `SessionRecorderTests.test_videoDisabled_noCaptureTexture_csvStillRecords` (video off → nil capture texture, no video.mp4, features.csv still records) + `test_videoEnabled_allocatesCaptureTexture`. CSV/stems unaffected.
- [x] Validated on real sessions (`22-10-50Z`, `13-57-23Z`, Matt): `video 0 appended` across a full session; `frame_cpu_ms` 15.78 → ~8.1 ms (render loop halved); 60 fps held; CSV/stems/raw-tap intact.
- [retired] ~~Activity-Monitor steady-state CPU roughly halves~~ — misdiagnosis (Activity Monitor is stem-separation-dominated, not video; see Status). The *frame-loop* CPU halved, which is what the gate can affect.

### BUG-034 — `sceneParamsB.z` double-booked (ambient vs D-057 step multiplier): every ray-march fixture renders at 32 steps vs live's 128 (2026-06-09)

**Severity:** P1 (test/prod parity, FA #66 class — golden hashes, RENDER_VISUAL contact sheets, and certification evidence for every ray-march preset are generated at 1/4 the live step budget).
**Domain tag:** renderer / preset.fidelity / test-isolation
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-12** — `[BUG-034]` increment on the worktree branch (commits: harness baseline coverage `9f25584c` → fix `e2c58905` → parity tests `5fb2035e` → harness production-parity `1a16411e` → golden regen + docs).
**Introduced:** D-057 frame-budget multiplier was packed into the slot `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms` already used for `sceneAmbient`.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-12. `sceneParamsB.z` is single-meaning: the D-057 step multiplier, defaulted to 1.0 by `makeSceneUniforms()` and `SceneUniforms()` so fixtures march the live 128-step budget by construction (no slot move needed — Task 1 audit found `.w` is SSGI's radius override, not free, and ambient had no consumer anywhere). Slot-map contract documented at the `SceneUniforms` definition. The M7-lite review also exposed that the deferred ray-march visual harness bound none of noise/IBL/SSGI/post-process/height-texture — upgraded to production-parity bindings (Matt-approved scope extension, mirrors the FerrofluidOceanVisualTests round-56/57 pattern). Certified presets: Lumen Mosaic provably unaffected (byte-identical pairs); Ferrofluid Ocean — Matt accepted live-path-unchanged (2026-06-12), no re-certification.

**Expected:** fixtures march the same step budget the live app uses.
**Actual:** `makeSceneUniforms()` (`PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms.swift:99`) packs `sceneAmbient` (default 0.1) into `sceneParamsB.z`; the G-buffer preamble (`PresetLoader+Preamble.swift:417`) reads `.z` as the D-057 step multiplier: `clamp(0.1, 0.25, 1.0) = 0.25` → `maxMarchSteps = 32`. The live path overwrites `.z = 1.0` per frame (`RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift:118`) → 128 steps. `PresetAcceptanceTests`, `PresetVisualReviewTests`, `PresetRegressionTests`, and `PresetContrastCertificationTests` all bind raw `makeSceneUniforms()` output. Corollary: the `scene_ambient` JSON sidecar field never reaches any shader on the live path — dead config + doc drift in `PresetDescriptor`.
**Reproduction steps:** render any ray-march preset via the fixture helper and via the live path; compare step counts (or diff a contact-sheet frame against a live capture at identical inputs).
**Session artifacts:** `docs/diagnostics/CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-09.md` §A6; before/after pairs `/tmp/phosphene_visual/BUG-034_pairs/` (M7-lite reviewed by Matt 2026-06-12); FBS pulse-gate A/B frames `/tmp/phosphene_visual/fbs_pulse/`.
**Fallout (resolved in-increment, Matt-approved):** `FerrofluidPulseLivePathTests` (FBS D-153/D-160 gate) had thresholds calibrated against the pre-fix 32-step render — its S1 region-MEAN measure only registered the punch because false sky broke the D-157 steady-global-luminance contract. Recalibrated at the production budget: S1 switched to the paired per-pixel |δ| measure (punch 2.46 vs rest exactly 0.0; floor 1.0), S2 loud/quiet ratio floor 1.8× → 1.2× (measured 1.38×; the height scaling itself is Matt-validated live, D-160). `FBS_PULSE_DUMP=1` now dumps the measured frames for eyeball verification.
**Suspected failure class:** `test-isolation` (FA #66 class) + `api-contract` (slot double-booking).
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: fixture and live path march identical step budgets by construction — `StepBudgetParityTests` (parity 128 == 128 derived through both code paths; default-1.0 guard). A/B-proven: temporary revert of the packing line turns both red (32 ≠ 128).
- [x] Golden-hash regen across all ray-march presets with before/after contact sheets — pairs reviewed by Matt (M7-lite, 2026-06-12) on the production-parity harness; KS + VL regenerated (10–13 bit drift), Glass Brutalist within tolerance (kept), Lumen Mosaic byte-identical, Ferrofluid golden already retired (D-124).
- [x] `scene_ambient` — **removed as dead config** (Task 1(b): no shader on any path consumed it; every `ambient` term in Metal is sky/IBL-derived). Removed from schema, `PresetDescriptor`, all five sidecars, SHADER_CRAFT §17 + prose, `Metals.metal` comment. A future ambient control starts at the design seat with a D-### and a consumer.

### BUG-035 — NoveltyDetector re-detects every section boundary ~4-5× after the similarity ring wraps; structural prediction (D-151 consumer) degraded (2026-06-09)

**Severity:** P2 (corrupts `StructuralAnalyzer` section durations / `predictedNextBoundary` / section confidence — the exact signal Skein.ENGINE.3 just wired live for Skein.5).
**Domain tag:** dsp.structure
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-09** — fixed as the `[BUG-035]` increment immediately before Skein.5 (single-increment P2 fix; evidence pre-documented in the audit doc).
**Introduced:** structural — `detectedBoundaries` stores logical ring indices that go stale as the ring slides.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-09, `[BUG-035]` commit on local main. `SelfSimilarityMatrix.totalFrameCount` (monotonic frames-added counter) + `NoveltyDetector` stores/dedups in **absolute** frame-index space (`Boundary.frameIndex` is now absolute); `MIRPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` write moved under the lock. A/B-proven: `noveltyDetect_ringWrap_boundaryRegistersOnce` (pre-fix 3 dups, identical timestamps) + `structuralAnalyzer_ringWrap_boundaryRegistersOnce` (production 600-frame geometry, pre-fix 2 dups); post-fix exactly 1 each. `SkeinStructureSignalTests` + AABA golden regression green. Manual criterion (features.csv section plausibility on a real session) folds into Skein.5's M7 session review.

**Expected:** each real musical section boundary registers once.
**Actual:** `SelfSimilarityMatrix` logical indices slide ~30 per `detect()` call once `storedCount == maxHistory` (`SelfSimilarityMatrix.swift:198-203`); `NoveltyDetector.swift:217`'s `tooCloseToExisting` compares fresh indices against the stale stored ones, so the same boundary passes the dedup again every ~1.3 s (~94 Hz analysis rate) — ~4-5 near-equal-timestamp duplicates per real boundary (`timestampForFrame` compensates for the slide, so duplicates carry ~equal timestamps). `StructuralAnalyzer.registerBoundary` appends unconditionally → section durations collapse toward 0, `avgDuration`/`predictedNextBoundary` garbage, `sectionIndex` inflates ~5×, confidence structurally depressed.
**Related:** `MIRPipeline.swift:277` — `latestStructuralPrediction` is the only published property written outside the lock (move under the lock in the same increment; class is `@unchecked Sendable`).
**Reproduction steps:** run any track past `maxHistory` frames; log `registerBoundary` calls — clusters of ~equal timestamps appear per real boundary.
**Session artifacts:** `docs/diagnostics/CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-09.md` (Audio/DSP P2 section).
**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm` (stale-index dedup).
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: each detected boundary registers exactly once across the ring slide (absolute frame counter dedup) — `noveltyDetect_ringWrap_boundaryRegistersOnce` + `structuralAnalyzer_ringWrap_boundaryRegistersOnce`, both A/B-proven against pre-fix source.
- [x] Automated: `latestStructuralPrediction` write moved under the lock (`SkeinStructureSignalTests` green).
- [ ] Manual: section indices/durations from a real session's `features.csv` are musically plausible (no sub-second "sections") — **evaluated 2026-06-10 (session `03-09-20Z`, the first with the Skein.5.2 columns): NOT plausible — but via a DIFFERENT mechanism than BUG-035** (a live-edge peak registered anew every ~4 detect intervals, not the same boundary re-admitted by ring slide; the BUG-035 A/B regression tests stay green). Criterion superseded by **BUG-040**.

### BUG-037 — Arachne spiral chord-count contract three-ways inconsistent (CPU 200 / shader 441 / test 104): spiral builds to ~45 % then pops to complete (2026-06-09)

**Severity:** P2 (visible build defect: per-chord reveal gate saturates at 200/441 ≈ 0.45, then the `.stable` snap shows the remaining ~55 % in one frame; build cycle halves to ~62 beats vs the documented ~136, firing `_presetCompletionEvent` early).
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity (Arachne)
**Status:** **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-18 — Matt's M7 (session `2026-06-18T14-30-52Z`): the full web draws to completion, then transitions on the completion event, no pop** (two-part root cause — chord-count single-source + `wait_for_completion_event` spanning sections — detailed in the M7 narrative below). Code fix landed CLEAN.3.4 (2026-06-17); automated criterion met. Single source of truth: the CPU's `spiralChordsTotal` (`ArachneState.recomputeSpiralChordTable`) now owns the count — the 200 cap (which sat *below* the legitimate 324–576 product so it always fired) was raised to `maxSpiralChords = 600`, a degenerate-case guard only; `spiralPacked` is published already-normalized (0..1) and the shader reveals by it directly (`saturate(spiral_packed)`), so the hardcoded 441 and the test's 104 are gone. The change is build-phase-temporal (the `.stable` golden is unchanged — the final spider is identical; only the reveal animation differs), so `PresetRegressionTests` stays green with no golden regen. **The manual/visual criterion needs a live M7** (the build reveal animates over the documented ~73 s; the existing RENDER_VISUAL harness only captures an early-build frame, so it cannot demonstrate the spiral reveal — best validated live or via a build-sequence render).

**M7 FAILED 2026-06-18 (Matt, session `2026-06-18T01-21-18Z`) — the pop persisted; the diagnosis was incomplete.** The chord-count normalization is verified *correct* in code (new test `ArachneStateBuildTests.spiralRevealClimbsPastOldCeiling` drives the build and reads the actual `webs[0].spiralPacked` climbing past 0.6 — the stuck-at-0.45 ceiling is gone). But the live pop has a **second, dominant root cause the audit missed**: Arachne's build (~92 s) **outlives its planned segment.** `wait_for_completion_event: true` only sets `maxDuration = .infinity` (`PresetMaxDuration:101`), which fills the current SECTION; `planOneSegment` still bounds the segment at `remainingInSection`, terminated `.sectionBoundary` (`SessionPlanner+Segments:177-192`). Love Rehab's section ≈ 38 s, so the plan-driven boundary cut the build mid-reveal → forced `.stable` snap = the pop. **The cap-raise made it worse** (build 54 s → 92 s, so the cut lands at a lower reveal %). Matt's call (AskUserQuestion 2026-06-18): **make `wait_for_completion_event` truly span sections.** Fix (planner): `planOneSegment` now gives a completion-gated preset a segment spanning its `naturalCycleSeconds` (capped at `trackEnd`); `planSegments` tracks `coveredUntil` so covered sections don't re-emit — the plan boundary lands past the build's completion, the build finishes (reveal → 1.0), and the live completion event drives the transition with no pop. Gate: `SessionPlannerTests.waitForCompletion_segmentSpansSections`; 25 SessionPlanner + 99 orchestrator/integration tests green. Normalization + cap-raise stay (correct once the build completes). **RESOLVED — Matt live-validated 2026-06-18 (session `2026-06-18T14-30-52Z`):** the full web draws to completion, then transitions on the completion event — *no pop*. Arachne ran 14:31:25 → 14:32:08 (~43 s; the live electronic beat density laid the spiral faster than the 118 BPM grid estimate) and ended on the build's completion event, not the section boundary. Known follow-up: the completion event advances via `presetLoader.nextPreset()` (loader cycle), so the preset *after* a completed wait-preset is off-plan — a minor variety deviation, not a pop; flag if it matters.
**Introduced:** post-BUG-011 ranges (`radialCount`/`spiralRevolutions` ∈ [18, 24], `ArachneState._reset()` :1086-1087) made the uncapped chord product 324-576, so the `min(200, …)` cap at `recomputeSpiralChordTable()` (`ArachneState.swift:1005`) **always** fires; the shader normalizes `spiral_packed / 441.0` (`Arachne.metal:1336`); `PresetAcceptanceTests.swift:335` uses a third value (104).
**Resolved:** 2026-06-18 — chord-count single source (`d430d64`) + the `wait_for_completion_event`-spans-sections planner fix (`e6a530d`); Matt live-validated (session `2026-06-18T14-30-52Z`, no pop). The audit's chord-count framing was necessary but not sufficient — the build-outlives-its-section pacing was the dominant cause.

**Expected:** spiral chords reveal continuously outside-in to completion (D-095 per-chord gate), with the documented ~92 s round-8 build cycle.
**Actual:** `fgProgress` saturates at ~0.45 → ~45 % of chords visible, then a one-frame pop to complete; `spiralChordRadii` truncates at radius ≈ 0.27 instead of reaching the 0.05 core.
**Reproduction steps:** run Arachne through a full build cycle (live or `PresetVisualReviewTests` frame phase); watch chord coverage vs `frame_progress`.
**Session artifacts:** `docs/diagnostics/CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-09.md` (Presets P2 section).
**Suspected failure class:** `api-contract` (three uncoordinated constants for one contract) **+ `pipeline-wiring`** (the dominant live cause: `wait_for_completion_event` segments cut at the section boundary).
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated (CLEAN.3.4): the CPU `spiralChordsTotal` is the single source — shader reveals by the CPU-normalized `spiralPacked` (no constant), test fixture aligned. `ArachneStateBuildTests.spiralChordCountHonoursProduct` + `spiralRevealClimbsPastOldCeiling`; the planner span is locked by `SessionPlannerTests.waitForCompletion_segmentSpansSections`.
- [x] Manual/visual (M7, Matt 2026-06-18): the full web draws continuously to the core, then transitions on the completion event — no pop (session `2026-06-18T14-30-52Z`).

### BUG-042 — Structural sections are still ~1.5 s on real music: the analyzer's GEOMETRY is note-scale (6.4 s window, 85 ms checkerboard), not section-scale — and post-BUG-040 confidence now endorses the junk (2026-06-10)

**Severity:** P2 (the Skein.5 structure sub-feature and the orchestrator's `StructuralPrediction` consumer act on a boundary every ~1.5 s with confidence 0.85–1.00 — worse than pre-BUG-040, where low confidence at least kept the gates shut).
**Domain tag:** dsp.structure
**Status:** **Fix landed (CLEAN.6.2, 2026-06-19) — code-complete, pending validation.** The analyzer now decimates its ~94 Hz input to one structural frame every 0.5 s (2 Hz) before the similarity matrix, so the fixed frame-denominated geometry is section-scale: 8-frame checkerboard = 4 s, `minPeakDistance` 16 = 8 s minimum section, 600-frame ring = 5 min. BUG-035/040 + AABA regression tests re-expressed and green at the new rate (DSP suite 23/23 + MIRPipeline structural green). **Validation (FA #27 — real audio only):** the 30 s tempo-fixture replay showed no note-scale junk but could NOT show the opposite failure (no real section fits in 30 s). Matt's live **Smells Like Teen Spirit** session (`2026-06-19T14-50-27Z`) did: the section-scale fix was **over-conservative** — **1 boundary in 5 min at confidence 0** → no structural preset-switching (stayed on one preset). Diagnosed by an offline floor sweep of that session's `raw_tap.wav` through the production FFT→MIRPipeline path: `minNoveltyFloor = 0.02` (sized for the noisy *pre*-decimation stream) gated out every real section — the 0.5 s decimation smooths the stream so real-section novelty peaks land at **~0.005–0.02**. **Recalibrated 0.02 → 0.01** (the clean knee): SLTS now yields **9 sections at confidence 0.64** at musically real times (26 s = intro→verse drop, then 46/98/112/124/166/207/228/287); the 3 tempo fixtures stay junk-free (0/0/1 on 30 s); 19 structural unit tests green. **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-19** — Matt's live re-test (session `2026-06-19T15-48-25Z`, SLTS) confirmed the detector: **5 sections, confidence to 0.91**, at musically real times (start_s 8.5/25.4/47.4/93.2/110.3), and the one orchestrator switch landed *exactly* on section 1→2 — detector + wiring work, BUG-042's Expected is met. Presets didn't *visibly* track sections for two downstream reasons, both separate from this (detector) bug: (1) the reactive orchestrator only switches to a higher-scoring preset (`scoreGap > 0.05`, so it stayed on the best-scoring preset); (2) local-file sessions ran in reactive fallback because `buildPlan()` was disabled (2026-05-28 BUG-021 revert) — itself caused by THIS bug's junk detector inflating `estimatedSectionCount` to ~180 → planner segment-cycling. Both are tracked under the **LFPLAN** increment (LF planning re-enabled `a07b0d1`; `PlannerSectionCountScalingTests` pins the 180→9 link; pending Matt's live playlist validation). 2026-06-11 (BUG-046): the Skein consumer's 10 wall-s boundary-spacing guard stays (harmless after the fix).
**Introduced:** structural — the analyzer's defaults were sized for a different feature rate; at the live ~94 Hz analysis rate the geometry detects note/bar novelty, not sections.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-19 — 2 Hz section-scale decimation (`9779337`) + `minNoveltyFloor` 0.02→0.01 recalibration (`3d2b263`); live-validated SLTS `2026-06-19T15-48-25Z` (5 sections, conf 0.91). Files to §Resolved at next pruning.

**Expected:** musical sections of 15–60 s with confidence that reflects real form.
**Actual (session `2026-06-10T17-39-41Z`, 6 streaming tracks):** boundaries every **1.3–2.5 s** on every track (Love Rehab: 30 in ~50 s), `section_start_s` now sane and durations now CONSISTENT — so duration-consistency-driven confidence climbs to **0.85–1.00** and the Skein conf gate opens on junk (the exact risk noted in the BUG-040 fix rationale).
**Why BUG-040's fixes were insufficient:** all three were real (frozen clock, live-edge dedup escape, no absolute floor) but operate at the wrong SCALE. `maxHistory = 600` frames at ~94 Hz = a **6.4-second** similarity window; `kernelHalfWidth = 8` frames = **85 ms** checkerboard blocks. An 85 ms before/after comparison inside a 6.4 s memory detects fills, chord changes and transients — every one a "boundary." The `minNoveltyFloor = 0.02` was calibrated on a smooth synthetic fixture (junk ≈ 0.0003); real music's frame-to-frame chroma variance puts baseline novelty far above it. The 1.3–2.5 s cadence = peaks admitted as fast as `minPeakDistance` (120 frames ≈ 1.28 s) allows.
**Reproduction steps:** any real track ≥ 1 min; read the section tail columns — index inflates every ~1.5 s with high confidence.
**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-10T17-39-41Z/features.csv` (cols 53–55).
**Suspected failure class:** `calibration` (detector geometry vs feature rate).
**Proposed direction (next increment):** run the STRUCTURAL feature stream at section scale — aggregate the 16-dim feature vector to ~2 Hz (mean over ~0.5 s) before it enters the similarity matrix. The same code then gives: 600-frame ring = **5 minutes** of memory, 8-frame kernel = **4-second** checkerboard blocks, `minPeakDistance` retuned to ~16 (≈ 8 s minimum section). Re-calibrate `minNoveltyFloor` against REAL session feature streams (replayable from raw_tap/preview audio), not synthetic fixtures. The Skein conf-gate thresholds stay; the existing BUG-035/040 regression tests must be re-expressed at the new rate.
**Verification criteria:**
- [~] Automated (real audio): **negative DONE** (3 tempo fixtures junk-free, 0/0/1 on 30 s) **+ positive DONE offline** — after the `minNoveltyFloor` 0.02→0.01 recalibration, the `StructuralSectionScaleReplay` sweep of Matt's SLTS `raw_tap.wav` (`PHOSPHENE_REPLAY_WAV`) finds **9 musically-plausible sections at conf 0.64** (was 1 at conf 0 pre-recalibration). **Live confirm PENDING** (Matt's re-test; calibrated on one track). (`FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` can't help — it writes stems.csv only, no structural stream.)
- [x] Automated: BUG-035 (ring-wrap dedup) + BUG-040 (edge guard / floor / clock) regression tests green at the new feature rate. **DONE (CLEAN.6.2)** — re-expressed at section scale; the live-edge guard's "evolving material registers nothing" fixture was made monotonic (the pre-fix incommensurate sinusoids had a ~25 s period that is now a legitimate section).
- [ ] Manual: a live session's section columns show 15–60 s sections; confidence high only on genuinely sectional material. *(Pending Matt's live read.)*

### BUG-043 — Mid-playback analysis stall: a 9.6 s gap between analysis frames froze the visuals then lurched (2026-06-10)

> **Renumbered from BUG-042** (parallel-session number collision, 2026-06-10): BUG-042 = the structural-section geometry defect, filed earlier the same day. The FBS.S3.2 commit message references the old number.

**Severity:** P2 (a multi-second visual freeze + lurch mid-track; observed once, plus a 40 s gap during the silent prep window of the same session).
**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring` (audio-analysis cadence) — possibly BUG-039-adjacent (the video-writer stall instrumented the same week).
**Status:** ✅ RETIRED-AS-MONITORED 2026-07-11 (PUB.3 reconciliation) — meets its own retirement criterion: no recurrence in ~4 weeks of sessions since the BUG-036 sites-1+2 fix (2026-06-17). Re-file with instrumentation if a stall recurs.
**Resolved:** 2026-07-11 (retired per the entry's own criterion; root cause attributed to the BUG-036 RT-thread allocation pressure).

**Expected:** analysis frames arrive continuously (~60 Hz) for the whole session; `deltaTime` stays ~0.017 s.

**Actual (session `2026-06-10T17-50-56Z`, Love Rehab):** three gaps clustered at te 28.8–29.7 s — `deltaTime` 0.44 s, 0.33 s, then **9.59 s** — with a 50 ms CPU frame. During a gap the renderer keeps drawing the STALE FeatureVector (frozen pulse/features), then everything jumps at once when analysis resumes — Matt's "flashing around 30 s" on this track matches the gap end. The same session's silent prep window had a 40.4 s gap (may be benign idling — undetermined). The track also re-segmented mid-play (a second te-reset ~50 s in — cause undetermined, possibly a user restart).

**Reproduction steps:** unknown trigger — scan any session's `features.csv` for `deltaTime > 0.2` during audible playback.

**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-10T17-50-56Z/features.csv` (Love Rehab segment, te 28.8–29.7).

**Suspected failure class:** `resource-management` or `concurrency` (analysis-queue starvation / tap callback stall). The PERF-era "probably-environmental CPU bump" family is a prior with a similar smell.

**Validation (2026-06-17, session `2026-06-17T20-52-27Z`, after BUG-036 sites 1 + 2):** a full 8-track streaming session showed a rock-steady **60 Hz** analysis cadence — median Δt 0.0167 s, p99 0.0194 s, **worst gap 84 ms** over 25,017 audible frames — vs the 0.44 / 0.33 / **9.59 s** original incident. No freeze-lurch (Matt). The only > 0.2 s Δt gaps were the pre-play startup window (frame 0, silent) and a doorbell lull correctly handled as a user pause (BUG-057 suppression — analysis kept ticking on silence, so no gap). N = 1 for an intermittent defect → not closed; consistent with "fixed/mitigated by BUG-036," monitoring. The deferred BUG-036 site 3 + hand-off rework (the candidate concurrency fix) is **parked** because this came back clean.

**Verification criteria (when fixed):**
- [ ] Instrumentation: a log line whenever inter-analysis-frame dt exceeds 0.25 s during audible playback (with queue depths / tap callback timing).
- [ ] No dt > 0.5 s gaps during audible playback across a full session. — *held across session `20-52-27Z` (max 0.084 s during playback); needs to hold across several more before retirement.*

**Manual validation required:** Only if reproducible.

**Related:** BUG-039 (video-writer stall instrumentation), the PERF.2 "CPU bump" characterization (probably-environmental), FBS (a gap freezes the pulse and every other feature — any preset lurches at gap end).

### BUG-039 — Session video stops appending silently a few seconds into some sessions (intermittent; recorder keeps "running") (2026-06-09)

**Severity:** P2 (the session video is the primary M7 review artifact; a truncated video forces CSV-only reconstruction of visual defect reports — it directly degraded the Skein.5 M7 session review).
**Domain tag:** `resource-management` (session recorder / AVAssetWriter)
**Status:** **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-18 — Matt's live multi-session confirmation passed (the silent-stop signature no longer occurs).** Recovery landed 2026-06-10; the running-vs-actually-writing invariant landed CLEAN.3.6 (2026-06-17). The instrumentation caught the death certificate live in `2026-06-10T17-50-56Z`: the writer left `.writing` **10 s after lock** with `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11800 (AVErrorUnknown)` / underlying `NSOSStatusErrorDomain -16341` — an UNDOCUMENTED OSStatus (Apple forums confirm this -11800+mystery-status class is an intermittent encoder/format session failure; notably this was also the session with the BUG-042 analysis stalls — co-occurrence noted, causality unproven). Since the trigger is undocumented and intermittent, the durable fix is RECOVERY, not decoding: on writer death the partial file is retained (playable to its last 5 s fragment per BUG-022), the recorder **rolls to a new segment file** (`video_2.mp4`, `video_3.mp4`, …) within one frame, and recording resumes — bounded at 8 restarts/session. A session now never loses more than ~one fragment of video per death. Regression-locked by `test_videoWriterDeath_rollsToNewSegment_bothFilesReadable` (kills the live writer the way the field failure does — status leaves `.writing` with the file retained — and asserts both segments exist + the recovery segment is a readable video + the restart is logged). **CLEAN.3.6 (2026-06-17) added the running-vs-actually-writing invariant** (the follow-through the audit flagged): a successful-append counter + last-append frame index drive an invariant check at `finish()` that (a) appends a video-outcome summary to the session-end log line (`video N appended / S segment(s) / R restart(s) / disabled=bool`) so a recorder that kept "running" while the writer silently stopped can never look healthy from the artifacts, and (b) logs a loud `BUG-039 invariant VIOLATED` line when the silent-stop *signature* is present (writer locked, then appends stopped > 300 frames before session end with no death/restart and not disabled — every *explained* stop is excluded). The recovery test was extended to confirm appends resume after the roll (`videoFramesAppended > 0`, no false violation); the pure predicate is unit-tested GPU-free (`test_bug039Invariant_silentStopPredicate`). **Closure confirmed 2026-06-18 (Matt's live multi-session check — the affected-session signature no longer occurs).**
**Introduced:** unknown — intermittent; possibly long-standing (older sessions are mostly long-form, but `17-14-25Z` truncated at 15 s).
**Resolved:** —

**Expected:** `video.mp4` covers the whole session (BUG-022 fragmented MP4: at minimum up to the last 5 s fragment at abnormal exit).
**Actual:** intermittent early freeze with the recorder otherwise healthy: `2026-06-09T22-35-09Z` video froze at **120 frames / 5.005 s** (file mtime = session start + ~1 min) while features.csv/stems.csv/log ran the full ~10 min; `17-14-25Z` froze at **15.0 s** of a ~6 min session. Other same-day sessions are long (`21-23-07Z` 294.6 s, `13-06-15Z` 393.3 s). No `video frame skipped` / relock / error lines in any affected log — the writer locked (`video writer locked to 900x600 after 30 stable frames`) and then appends stopped through one of the SILENT paths.
**Reproduction steps:** not yet reproducible on demand (intermittent). Affected-session signature: `video.mp4` duration ≪ session length + zero video log lines after the lock line.
**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-09T22-35-09Z` (5.005 s of ~10 min), `17-14-25Z` (15.0 s of ~6 min); compare `21-23-07Z`/`13-06-15Z` (long).
**Suspected failure class:** `resource-management`. Candidate silent paths (all at `SessionRecorder+Video.swift` pre-instrumentation): (a) `videoInput.isReadyForMoreMediaData == false` persisting (typically means the writer stopped consuming — e.g. `status == .failed`); (b) `adaptor.append(...)` returning `false` with the result IGNORED (a failed append usually moves the writer to `.failed` permanently); (c) pixel-buffer pool exhaustion. A `.failed` writer was never detected anywhere — video stayed dead for the rest of the session with zero log output.

**Instrumentation landed (this increment — root-cause fix follows the next affected session):**
- Writer status checked per frame: a non-`.writing` writer logs ONE loud line with `writer.error` and stops attempting appends — **without deleting the partial file** (the fragmented MP4 keeps everything up to the last 5 s fragment).
- `isReadyForMoreMediaData == false`, pool failures, and `append == false` each log throttled counters with `writer.status` + `writer.error`.

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] Diagnosis: the next affected session's `session.log` names the failing path + `writer.error` (instrumentation criterion).
- [ ] Fix (subsequent increment): a full-length session video after the root-cause fix; affected-session signature no longer occurs across a multi-session week.
- [ ] Partial-file retention: an affected session still yields a playable partial `video.mp4` (no deletion on failure).

**Observation log:** `2026-06-10T03-09-20Z` (first session WITH the instrumentation): full-length video (333.6 s of a 335 s session), no stall — the defect did not fire. Still awaiting the first instrumented affected session.

### BUG-040 — NoveltyDetector registers a live-edge boundary every ~4 detect intervals on real music: sections of ~1.3–1.6 s, negative `section_start_s`, confidence pinned low (2026-06-10)

**Severity:** P2 (the structural signal D-151 delivers to Skein.5 is unusable on real music — every track reads as 20–35 "sections"; the Skein.5 confidence gate (smoothstep 0.25→0.55) correctly suppresses the visual bias, so the painting is unharmed, but the structure sub-feature is effectively INERT. Discovered the first day the Skein.5.2 columns existed — the instrumentation did its job.)
**Domain tag:** dsp.structure
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-10** (`[BUG-040]` fix increment — single-increment P2 per protocol; evidence was pre-filed).
**Introduced:** structural — distinct from BUG-035 (which is fixed and stays fixed: its mechanism was the SAME physical boundary re-admitted as the ring slid; this is a NEW boundary registered near the live edge over and over).
**Resolved:** 2026-06-10, `[BUG-040]` commit on local main. THREE compounding causes, all fixed:
1. **The frozen clock (the dominant cause of the timestamp/confidence symptoms):** the live analysis loop hardwires `time: 0` into `MIRPipeline.process` (`VisualizerEngine+Audio.processAnalysisFrame` — fv.time is populated separately), so the structural analyzer's clock never advanced: timestamps = `0 − age ≈ −0.3 s` (the exact observed −0.13…−0.77 range), durations were ±0.x noise, confidence pinned. Fix: `updateStructuralAnalysis` now clocks the analyzer from the pipeline's own track-relative `elapsedSeconds` (which resets exactly when `structuralAnalyzer.reset()` fires), never from the caller's `time` parameter.
2. **The live-edge peak:** on constantly-evolving real music the checkerboard response forms a local max at the newest valid window position; its ABSOLUTE index advances with the stream and escaped the (BUG-035-fixed) dedup every ~4 detect calls. Fix: edge guard — detection is restricted to the interior region (≥ `minPeakDistance` frames of after-context); a true boundary registers exactly once, ~2 s late (negligible at section timescale).
3. **The relative-only threshold:** mean + 1.5σ admits noise-scale "peaks" on smooth material (measured junk scores ~0.0003 vs ~0.43 for a real A→B boundary — three orders of magnitude apart). Fix: an absolute novelty floor (`minNoveltyFloor = 0.02`, ~66× the junk / ~20× under a real boundary) ANDed with the adaptive threshold.

**Expected:** a ~45–55 s pop track registers 1–4 section boundaries with multi-second durations and confidence that climbs on regular material.
**Actual (session `2026-06-10T03-09-20Z`, 6 streaming tracks, the audit catalog):** every track registers a boundary every **~1.3–1.6 s** (Love Rehab: 33 "sections"; Lotus Flower: 36) — the cadence ≈ **4 × the 30-frame detect interval**, exactly the spacing at which a peak whose ABSOLUTE index advances with the stream escapes the 120-frame dedup window. `section_start_s` is **negative** (−0.13…−0.77) essentially always — the registered timestamps sit "just before now," consistent with a peak at the newest edge of the novelty window plus a timestamp/fps skew. `section_confidence` is structurally pinned ≤ 0.30 (sub-second duration variance ⇒ near-zero duration consistency; brief 0.70/0.90 spikes on two tracks).
**Reproduction steps:** play any real track ≥ 1 min; read the `section_index`/`section_start_s`/`section_confidence` tail columns (Skein.5.2) — index inflates every ~1.5 s.
**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-10T03-09-20Z/features.csv` (cols 53–55).
**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm`. Working hypothesis (UNVERIFIED — needs a diagnosis increment): on real, constantly-evolving music the checkerboard novelty response forms a local maximum at/near the NEWEST valid window position (the after-block holds the freshest, most-different content). That edge peak's absolute index advances ~30 per detect call, so the BUG-035 absolute-index dedup (correct for stationary content peaks) re-admits it every 4th call. A true boundary should only register once it is INTERIOR to the window — i.e. peaks within ~`minPeakDistance` of the newest edge need an edge guard (register only after the peak survives with full bilateral context). The negative timestamps additionally suggest a `currentTime`/`fps` estimation skew in `timestampForFrame` worth auditing in the same diagnosis.
**Verification criteria (written before any fix):**
- [x] Automated: `structuralAnalyzer_evolvingMusicNoBoundary_registersNothing` (production geometry, 3000 continuously-drifting frames) — A/B-proven: pre-fix 5 junk boundaries, post-fix 0. All existing A→B fixtures + the AABA golden still register their boundaries exactly once.
- [x] Automated: `mirPipeline_structuralPrediction_liveCallerShape_timestampsNonNegative` replicates the live caller's `time: 0` shape end-to-end — A/B-proven: pre-fix `sectionStartTime → −0.3167` (the exact session signature), post-fix positive and within the fed span. Plus `structuralAnalyzer_boundaryTimestamps_nonNegativeAndPlausible` at the analyzer layer.
- [ ] Manual: a real session's section columns show multi-second sections and confidence that climbs on verse/chorus material — Matt's next session (the Skein.5.2 columns make it a one-awk check).

### BUG-029 — AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike pops/drops continuous-energy presets at every track onset (2026-06-06)

**Severity:** P3 (cosmetic startup artifact, ~1-2 s at each track onset; not a crash). Re-rate to P2 if judged to materially hurt the per-track first impression.
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat (AGC cold-start) — same family as BUG-025.
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (AGC3.5, `261c65a`).** Both halves of the non-waivable gate met: Matt's live M7 (session `2026-07-09T19-33-09Z`, Wake Up + Ferrofluid Ocean, correctly built from `origin/main`) — "Smooth" — AND the objective measurement on that real session: onset worst band **0.875** (physical; pre-fix 4.8), peak f.bass **0.798** (pre-fix 4.4), FFO `fo_spike` **1.64/1.14** — blowup eliminated, no pop-and-drop. **★ The first "fixed" session (`19-22-35Z`) still showed 23× because it was built WITHOUT the fix** (`ricercar-rework`, not `origin/main`) — discriminated by replaying its exact `raw_tap.wav` through the fixed code (worst band 1.05, not 4.8) before assuming a fix defect ([[feedback_worktree_changes_reach_build]]). AGC3.3 (`144f824`) was a PARTIAL fix (soft onsets only), falsely closed 2026-07-08 then reopened same day. **AGC3.5 (2026-07-09)** added a **fast-attack peak floor** to `BandEnergyProcessor`'s AGC, confined to a bounded onset window. Root cause: AGC3.3 seeded the running average from the first audible frame (the tiny leading edge of a percussive attack) and set `agcScale = 0.5/avg` immediately, while the slow warmup EMA (0.95, 5 %/frame) lagged the full transient landing ~0.3–0.5 s later → the blowup. The fix: within a **60-frame onset window** (opened at a session-start seed or on exit from a sustained-silence/inter-track hold), a frame whose energy exceeds 3.5× the running average snaps the average up toward it so the scale can't lag. **Gated to the onset window** — a first threshold-only version flattened mid-track snares (caught by `FerrofluidBeatSyncTests` mid-energy gate in closeout); the window confines the fast-attack to cold-start so mid-track transients get the normal EMA. **Validated on the real reproducer** (`AGC3RealAudioReplayTests` replaying the Wake Up `raw_tap.wav`): cold-start worst band **2.57 → 0.71** (physical; blowup gone). A committed **ramped-onset** synthetic (`agc3_rampedOnset_doesNotBlowUp_liveBandProcessor`) now catches the bug the step-function fixture missed (FA #27); steady-state byte-identical lock still green. Reproducers: sessions `2026-07-09T02-04-02Z` (SZ2 20×), `T17-35-12Z` (Wake Up 20× / KITM inter-track 16.1×). **To close: Matt watches FFO arrive smoothly on a fresh hard-onset session.**
**Introduced:** structural — `BandEnergyProcessor`'s total-energy AGC seeds its running average from whatever energy is present at capture start; during the inter-track silence the running average decays toward zero, so the first audio frame of every track explodes the AGC scale before it catches up.
**Resolved:** — (reopened; AGC3.3 is a partial fix)

**Expected:** continuous-energy presets (those reading `f.bass`/`f.mid`/`f.treble` directly) arrive smoothly when a track's audio starts.

**Actual (session `2026-06-06T01-18-36Z`):** at every track onset the first audible frame spikes `f.bass` far above its steady ~0.25 — **Cherub Rock te=1.42 `f.bass`=4.003; Alameda te=0.66 `f.bass`=3.697**. Ferrofluid Ocean (`spikeStrength = 1.0 + 0.8·clamp(f.bass,0,1)`) pops to 1.8× then collapses as bass settles — a "pop-and-drop," not a smooth arrival. During the preceding silent pre-roll `f.bass`=0 so the spikes sit flat/static (only the slow Gerstner swell moves), so the preset reads near-static then jarringly pops.

**Reproduction steps:** play any local-file or streaming session; inspect `features.csv` `bass` at each track's first audible frame — it spikes ~5-15× the steady value for ~1-2 s while the AGC scale catches up.

**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-06T01-18-36Z/features.csv` (Cherub Rock + Alameda startups); **`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-07-09T02-04-02Z/` (track SZ2 — the hard-onset reproducer the earlier close lacked: 14.8×, `fo_spike` 1.80/1.21).**

**Suspected failure class:** `calibration` — AGC seed/scale on the silence→onset transition. **Reopen hypothesis (unverified — instrument, don't guess):** with ~0 s pre-roll the seed-from-first-audible logic seeds off a near-silent lead-in frame, so the running-average denominator is still too small when the bass slams in ~1 s later.

**Verification criteria (when resolved):**
- [x] **Automated (synthetic fixture — PASSES BUT INSUFFICIENT):** on a silence→onset fixture through the real `MIRPipeline.process`, `f.bass` does not exceed 2× steady. *(`AGC3ColdStartSpikeTests` — 32.6×→<2×, 10.6×→<2×.)* **This green did not catch the real-track spike (FA #27) — the fixture must be extended with an immediate/hard-onset case (0 s pre-roll, energy slam ~1 s in) that reproduces the 14.8× before any re-fix.**
- [x] **Automated (real-audio + committed ramped reproducer):** `AGC3RealAudioReplayTests` replays a hard-onset `raw_tap.wav` (env `AGC3_REAL_WAV`; copyrighted audio is not committed, per repo policy) — Wake Up cold-start worst band **2.57 → 0.71**. Plus the committed synthetic **ramped-onset** `agc3_rampedOnset_doesNotBlowUp_liveBandProcessor` (fails at 2.14 without the fix, passes with it — the FA #27-aware reproducer the step-function fixture wasn't). Criterion refined: the gate is the AGC-scale **blowup** (worst band < 2.0 through the convergence window), not onset-vs-steady ratio (a loud intro legitimately exceeds 2× a quieter steady).
- [x] **Manual (non-waivable):** Matt confirmed Ferrofluid Ocean arrives smoothly on Wake Up (hard-onset) — "Smooth" — on the correctly-built session `2026-07-09T19-33-09Z`; corroborated objectively (onset worst band 0.875 vs pre-fix 4.8).

**Manual validation required:** Yes — it's a felt visual artifact. **The 2026-07-08 close waived this and was wrong (see Status); do not re-close without a hard-onset real-audio check.**

**Related:**
- BUG-025 — the AGC cold-start transient (shelved as P3); same AGC-seed family, re-surfaced via its effect on `f.bass`-driven presets.
- BUG-027 / AGC2 — the deviation fix; its cold-start warmup (AGC2.4.1) is a *separate* mechanism inside `BandDeviationTracker` and does **not** touch `f.bass`. FFO reads `f.bass` directly, so AGC2 does not help it — hence this separate filing. Highest-leverage fix smooths the AGC seed/scale at the source (broad benefit: every `f.bass` consumer).

### AGC3.1 evidence (2026-06-05)

Measured from the reference session `2026-06-06T01-18-36Z` (LF, 5 tracks) with the permanent
diagnostic [`tools/agc3/measure_coldstart_spike.py`](../../tools/agc3/measure_coldstart_spike.py).
Full write-up: [`docs/diagnostics/AGC3_1_COLDSTART_SPIKE_2026-06-05.md`](../diagnostics/AGC3_1_COLDSTART_SPIKE_2026-06-05.md).

| trk | mode | pre-roll s | **peak f.bass** | steady | **ratio** | spike s | fo_peak→steady |
|----:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|
| 1 | session-start | 1.00 | **4.003** | 0.356 | 11.3× | 0.10 | 1.800 → 1.285 |
| 2 | inter-track | 0.39 | **3.697** | 0.215 | 17.2× | 0.91 | 1.800 → 1.172 |
| 3 | inter-track | 0.50 | **3.471** | 0.203 | 17.1× | 1.19 | 1.800 → 1.162 |
| 4 | inter-track | 0.00 | 0.486 | 0.213 | 2.3× | 0.00 | 1.388 → 1.170 |
| 5 | inter-track | 0.02 | 0.874 | 0.220 | 4.0× | 0.00 | 1.699 → 1.176 |

Four findings sharpen the filed entry:

1. **"Every track onset" → confirmed, refined: every onset preceded by *any* silence gap.**
   The one non-spiking onset (track 4) had **zero** pre-roll; even a one-frame (0.02 s) gap
   spiked 4× (track 5). Magnitude saturates by ~0.4 s of silence. For LF playback an
   inter-track gap is the norm → recurs on essentially every track. Absolute peak (~3.5–4.0)
   is the stable cross-track number; the ratio varies with track loudness (set any fix
   threshold against the absolute value/scale, not the ratio).
2. **Both modes fire; the inter-track mode is the *worse* one.** Session-start (frame-0 seed
   off `1e-6`) self-corrects in ~0.10 s via the fast warmup rate (0.95). Later onsets, with
   the AGC in its slow steady-state rate (0.992), spike **0.9–1.2 s**. This refutes the
   BUG-025 "one-time ~2 s flash" shelving premise — it is per-track and the per-track
   instances last longer than the session-start one.
3. **Downstream pop-and-drop confirmed.** `fo_spike_strength` pins to its **1.800** clamp
   ceiling on every spiking onset (f.bass > 1) then collapses to 1.16–1.29 — a **+40–55 %
   spike-height pop** that drops within 0.1–1.2 s.
4. **The per-stem path does NOT spike** (ratios 0.8–1.4). `StemAnalyzer` runs the same
   `BandEnergyProcessor` per stem but **resets them per track** (`StemAnalyzer.reset()` →
   `processor.reset()`), re-seeding each stem's AGC from its first audible frame. Only the
   main-mix `MIRPipeline` processor is not reset per track — that asymmetry is the spike's
   immediate cause, and the per-stem reset/re-seed is a shipped in-codebase precedent the
   AGC3.2 fix decision can draw on (must keep BUG-018 green).

**Coverage gap:** characterised on **local-file only** — every recorded multi-track session
on disk is `origin=localFile`. The session-start mode is path-independent; the inter-track
mode depends on whether the streaming app emits silence between tracks. A streaming
multi-track recording is needed to close this (flagged for Matt).

### BUG-027 — Positive deviation primitives (`bassDev`/`midDev`/`trebDev`) structurally near-dead for any band that isn't dominant (2026-06-02)

**Severity:** P2 (silently weakens the canonical D-026 Layer-2 "above-average" motion driver for every preset that consumes the positive deviation primitives, on every capture path — not a crash, but a load-bearing-design-doesn't-do-what-it-says issue).
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat (deviation-primitive derivation)
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-06 (AGC2.1 → 2.5).** Matt chose the (b)+(c)-split at the AGC2.2 gate (**D-146**): a per-band EMA pivot on the FeatureVector band deviation (mirror the stem path) + document the stem-energy offset. Implemented in AGC2.3 (`BandDeviationTracker`); a cold-start warmup was added in AGC2.4.1 after the M7 exposed a session-start hole. See the **Resolution** block below. Surfaced during the BUG-025 A/B correction. **Re-confirmed 2026-06-05 (Nimbus NB.10 r1.6):** the same wrong "centres at 0.5" assumption mis-calibrated Nimbus's `bloom` (stem-energy = 3 AGC bands summed, centres ~0.30 not 0.5 → tiny bodies on normal music). Nimbus was fixed with a local recalibration, but this is the second preset bitten by the system-wide root cause — a normalisation fix here (make the AGC produce a true 0.5 centre per band/stem) would let every preset calibrate against a real 0.5 and is the proper permanent fix. Candidate for its own project (cf. the beat-grid D-145 pattern).
**Introduced:** D-026 / MV-1 (the deviation-primitive design). The fixed 0.5 pivot has always assumed each band's AGC-normalised value centres at 0.5; it doesn't.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-06 — commits `bf711edf` (AGC2.1 measure), `b1c1d1b7` (D-146 decision), `41d87bf9` + `0d2ddb51` (AGC2.3 fix), `95a16881` (AGC2.4.1 cold-start warmup). On `main` (origin/main).

### Expected behavior

Per CLAUDE.md §Audio Data Hierarchy Layer 2 and D-026, the deviation primitives are "the primary above-average motion driver." `bassDev` should fire (be meaningfully positive) when the bass is above its own running average — i.e. reasonably often on real music (intuitively 30–50 % of frames on a bass-driven track), so presets driving motion from `bassDev` get a lively signal.

### Actual behavior

`bassDev = max(0, (bass − 0.5) × 2)` fires only when the AGC-normalised `bass` output exceeds 0.5. But `bass` is normalised by `agcScale = 0.5 / agcRunningAvg`, where `agcRunningAvg` tracks **total 6-band energy**, not per-band energy (`BandEnergyProcessor.swift:204`, `totalRawEnergy = raw6.reduce(0, +)`). So an individual band's output centres at `0.5 × (that band's fraction of total energy)`. A band that is, say, half the total energy centres at 0.25 → its `*Dev` only fires on a > +2σ excursion → almost never.

Measured (frames downstream of clean AGC resets, both capture paths):

```
                bass mean   bassRel mean   bassDev fires
LF (Atlas)        0.254       −0.49          2.9 %
Spotify           0.222       −0.55          1.5 %
```

`bassDev` firing on < 3 % of frames means any preset relying on it for primary motion gets a near-dead signal — independent of capture path. The *signed* `bassRel` (stddev ≈ 0.21 on both paths) carries the real information; the positive-only `*Dev` clamp throws most of it away.

### Reproduction steps

1. Capture any session (LF or streaming) on bass-dominant or spectrally-uneven music.
2. Inspect `features.csv`: `bassDev` column is 0 on the large majority of frames; `bassRel` is mostly negative.
3. Confirm the same on an LF session — this is not capture-path-specific.

**Minimum reproducer:** any session; the Atlas-LF (`2026-06-01T22-37-01Z`) and Spotify (`2026-06-02T01-12-51Z`) sessions both demonstrate it.

### Session artifacts

`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-01T22-37-01Z/` (LF) and `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-02T01-12-51Z/` (Spotify). 6-band means on the Spotify session: `subBass 0.234, lowBass 0.232, lowMid 0.029, midHigh 0.003, highMid 0.001, high 0.001` — energy concentrated in bass, so total-energy normalisation pushes every individual band's output (and thus its `*Dev`) low.

### Suspected failure class

`calibration` — the 0.5 pivot in the deviation formula assumes per-band centring that the total-energy AGC does not produce.

### Verification criteria

When resolved:
- [x] **Automated:** on a recorded bass-dominant fixture, the chosen "above-average bass" primitive fires on ≥ 20 % of frames. *(`RelDevTests.bandDeviation_firesAboveOwnAverage_onRecordedBass`: the old fixed-0.5 pivot fires 7.2 %, the new per-band EMA fires 41 % on the recorded Atlas fixture.)*
- [x] **Automated:** existing deviation-primitive contract tests (`RelDevTests`) still pass or are updated with the new semantics. *(The fixed-0.5 formula pin was deliberately retired → `BandDeviationTracker` unit tests + the cold-start live-path test; 10/10 green, SwiftLint `--strict` clean.)*
- [x] **Manual:** Matt confirms presets that consume the above-average-bass primitive read as appropriately reactive across multiple tracks. *(M7 catalog cycle, session `2026-06-06T01-18-36Z` — deviation presets read well. The one flagged issue, Ferrofluid Ocean's startup, was diagnosed **out of scope**: FFO reads `f.bass`/`arousal`, no deviation primitives; its root is the AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike, filed as **BUG-029**.)*

**Manual validation required:** Yes — affects the deviation-consuming presets (Arachne, Aurora Veil, Dragon Bloom, Gossamer, Kinetic Sculpture, Spectral Cartograph, Volumetric Lithograph). Done at the M7 catalog cycle.

### Fix scope

**Not yet scoped; needs a design decision, not a quick patch.** Candidate directions (each affects all 8 deviation-consuming presets + their golden hashes, so this is a real increment with M7 across the catalog, NOT a trivial fix):
- (a) **Per-band running average** — give each band its own AGC EMA so `bandDev` centres on that band's own average. Cleanest semantically; changes the AGC's whole character; invalidates golden hashes.
- (b) **Recenter the deviation pivot per-band** — derive each band's typical fraction-of-total and pivot the deviation there instead of at 0.5. Less invasive than (a).
- (c) **Document `*Dev` as "rare strong-transient only" and steer preset authors to signed `*Rel`** — no engine change; the Dragon Bloom 2026-06-02 re-tune already does this (uses signed `bass_rel`, not `bass_dev`). Lowest risk; makes the limitation explicit rather than fixing it.

Recommend deciding between (a/b/c) with Matt before any implementation — this is the structural issue the BUG-025 misdiagnosis was pointing at, and it deserves a deliberate call, not a rushed fix.

### AGC2.1 evidence refresh (2026-06-05)

The two sessions named under "Session artifacts" above (`2026-06-01T22-37-01Z`,
`2026-06-02T01-12-51Z`) **no longer exist on disk**; AGC2.1 re-measured on 4 current sessions
across both paths and 4 spectral classes. Harness: `tools/agc2/measure_deviation_centring.py`.
Full tables: [`docs/diagnostics/AGC2_1_DEVIATION_CENTRING_2026-06-05.md`](../diagnostics/AGC2_1_DEVIATION_CENTRING_2026-06-05.md).

Three findings sharpen the original entry:

1. **Manifestation A is broader than the bass-only headline.** `bassDev` fires 2–8 % of active
   frames, but **`midDev`/`trebDev` fire ~0 % on every session, both paths — including a genuinely
   mid-rich acoustic track (Elliott Smith, mid p50 0.07) and a treble-rich jazz track (Mingus, mid
   p50 0.10, cymbals/horns).** The mid band's centre rises with spectral focus but never approaches
   0.5, so the entire positive mid/treble deviation channel is dead catalog-wide. Structural (total-
   energy AGC pins non-bass bands below 0.5 regardless of genre), not genre-correlated.
2. **Manifestation B splits.** Raw `{stem}Energy` centres ~0.25–0.45 (≠ 0.5) and bites consumers
   that read it directly (Nimbus bloom). But `{stem}EnergyDev` fires **56–77 %** — the stem
   deviation path uses a **per-stem EMA pivot** (`StemAnalyzer.swift:277-298`), not the fixed 0.5,
   so it self-centres and is **already healthy**. Only the raw-energy-0.5 assumption needs handling.
3. **The working pattern already ships in-codebase**: the stem path (per-element EMA pivot, alive)
   vs the band path (fixed-0.5 pivot, dead) sit side by side. Fixing A = bringing the band path in
   line with the stem path. This is the (b)-leaning evidence; the call is Matt's at AGC2.2.

### Resolution (AGC2.1 → 2.5, 2026-06-06)

**Decision (D-146):** the (b)+(c)-split. The fixed-0.5 pivot in `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector` was replaced with a **per-band running-average pivot** (`BandDeviationTracker`, mirroring `StemAnalyzer`'s per-stem EMA): each band's `*Rel`/`*Dev` is now measured against the band's own recent average. The total-energy AGC is untouched (raw `f.bass/mid/treble` and cross-band info unchanged). Stems needed no engine change — the stem deviation path was already EMA-based and healthy; the raw-`{stem}Energy`-centre is handled per-consumer (Nimbus already recalibrated, D-144 r1.6) and documented.

**Additive form** chosen over scale-free `x/ema−1` (AGC2.3 prototype) — preserves the `[-1,1]`-ish `*Rel` convention and avoids unbounded spikes. Mid/treble `*Dev` are quieter than `bassDev` in absolute terms (those bands are quiet post-AGC) — an authoring note, see SHADER_CRAFT §14.1.

**No golden-hash drift** — `PresetRegressionTests` feed hand-built FeatureVectors, bypassing the live derivation; the *live* runtime values change (catalog M7 validated that).

**Cold-start sub-fix (AGC2.4.1):** the AGC2.4 M7 (`2026-06-05T23-57-14Z`) exposed a hole — the per-band EMA seeded from the session-start AGC spike (bass = 3.69 off the initial silence) and, since `MIRPipeline.reset()` is never called per track, stayed poisoned ~3-4 min, suppressing all band `*Dev` early. Fixed with a two-speed warmup (fast decay converges through the spike in ~1-2 s) + a value ceiling. A **live-path** test (`bandDeviation_recoversFromColdStart_liveMIRPipeline`) now reproduces and guards it — closing the FA #66 parity gap that let the hole ship. (Replaying the fix over the M7 session: the early tracks recover, e.g. Alameda mid 0 → 59 %, Mingus treble 0 → 63 %.)

**Out of scope, filed separately:** the AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike itself (**BUG-029**) — it pops/drops continuous-energy presets (Ferrofluid Ocean) at every track onset; it's a `BandEnergyProcessor` AGC issue, not a deviation issue, and AGC2's warmup is a separate mechanism that does not touch `f.bass`.

### BUG-025 — AGC running-average poisoned by post-`active` startup transient on Spotify process-tap (2026-06-01)

> **CORRECTED 2026-06-02 — root cause was misdiagnosed; severity downgraded P2 → P3.** A LF↔Spotify A/B (sessions `2026-06-01T22-37-01Z` Atlas-LF vs `2026-06-02T01-12-51Z` Spotify) during the AGC.1 scoping step disproved the original "session-wide starvation" claim below. Two facts the original entry got wrong:
> 1. **The transient is one-time, ~2 s, at the very first audio onset only.** Subsequent track changes call `reset()` and re-initialise the AGC cleanly from the first audio-playing frame — they show gentle ramps, no transient. So the transient does NOT poison the whole session; it affects ~2 s once at session start.
> 2. **The session-wide `bassDev ≈ 0` starvation is STRUCTURAL, not caused by the transient, and is identical on LF.** Measured in transient-free segments downstream of clean track-change resets: `bassDev` fires on 1.5 % of Spotify frames and **2.9 % of the LF session that "danced."** The deviation primitive `bassDev = max(0, (bass−0.5)×2)` fires only when the bass band exceeds the *total-energy* AGC average — structurally rare for bass-dominant music on any capture path (6-band means: `subBass 0.23, lowBass 0.23, lowMid 0.03, rest ≈ 0`). It is the fixed-0.5-pivot interacting with total-energy normalisation, not an AGC mis-convergence.

> **What's actually real here:** a genuine but minor cold-start visual flash in the first ~2 s of a fresh session's first onset. That's the only defect; it's cosmetic, hence P3. The "muted on Spotify" symptom that motivated this entry was (a) raw-waveform amplitude gap, fixed in Dragon Bloom commit `cffefe65`, and (b) the structural `bassDev` limitation that affects LF equally — addressed at the preset level by the 2026-06-02 Dragon Bloom re-tune (route to signals alive on both paths: signed `bass_rel`, `spectralFlux`, beat — not `bassDev`/`mid_att_rel` which are structurally dead on bass-dominant music). The AGC.1 transient-rejection fix (kickoff `docs/prompts/AGC1_KICKOFF.md`) is **shelved** — it would fix only the 2 s flash, which is not worth a cross-cutting AGC change touching 8 presets. **The structural deviation-pivot limitation is the real latent issue and is filed separately as BUG-027.**

**Severity:** ~~P2~~ → **P3** (cosmetic ~2 s cold-start flash at the very first onset of a fresh session; not session-wide; does not affect track changes).
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat (AGC convergence)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (PUB.3 reconciliation) — **subsumed by AGC3.5 (the BUG-029 fix, `261c65a`)**: the residual defect here was the one-time ~2 s over-scale flash at a fresh session's first onset, and AGC3.5's fast-attack peak floor fires in exactly that window (opened at session-start seed / exit from silence hold), live-validated by Matt ("Smooth", onset worst band 0.875 vs 4.8 pre-fix). The 2026-06-02 shelving decision stands vindicated — the eventual fix was onset-window-scoped, not the cross-cutting AGC change this entry declined. Structural pivot limitation remains BUG-027 (separately resolved, D-146).
**Introduced:** AGC EMA's interaction with a long silent pre-playback period (the AGC runs during silence, floors its average + burns its warmup window, then over-scales the first ~2 s of real audio). First measurement-grade observation: Dragon Bloom Spike 1 debug session `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-01T22-57-10Z`.
**Resolved:** —

> *The original investigation record below is preserved verbatim. Read it as the data that LED to the corrected diagnosis above — its "Actual behavior" section's "entire rest of the session" claim is the part the A/B disproved.*

### Expected behavior

When the process-tap goes from `silent` → `active` (audio first reaches the AGC after Spotify starts playing), the per-band AGC running averages should converge to a value reflecting steady-state playback within a small number of seconds. Steady-state `bassRel ≈ 0` (bass equals running average) and the deviation primitives `bassDev` / `midDev` should fire on real transients across most of the session.

### Actual behavior

The first 5–10 frames after `audio signal → active` show extreme transient amplitude spikes (`bass` values 50× the eventual steady-state value — see Session artifacts). These spikes appear to be FFT cold-start or buffer-fill transients, NOT real audio content, but they enter the AGC EMA with the same weight as legitimate signal. The EMA running average gets pulled up high by them and decays only over the EMA's time constant — meaning **the entire rest of the session sees an artificially inflated running average**. Symptoms over the remaining session:

- `bassRel` is structurally negative across nearly all post-startup frames (observed range −0.42 to −0.89 in the reference session).
- `bassDev = max(0, bassRel)` therefore fires (≥ 0.05) on only ≈ 1.6 % of frames — instead of the expected ≈ 30–50 % on a normal music track.
- Deviation-driven preset routing (D-026: `bassDev` / `midDev` as the primary "above-average" motion driver) is effectively dead for the session.
- AGC's intended inter-track normalisation does not engage — the "is this above the running average" question reads as "no" on almost every frame.

### Reproduction steps

1. Run Phosphene against a Spotify tap session. Any modern Spotify playlist with a mix of loud and quiet sections works; the Dragon Bloom debug session used Son Lux *Flickers* + Wild Beasts *Wanderlust* + other tracks.
2. Wait for `audio signal → active` in `session.log`.
3. Inspect `features.csv` `bass` column: rows in the first ~10 frames after `active` show values 5–50× the median; the median itself is well below 0.5.
4. Inspect `bassRel` across the rest of the session: predominantly negative.
5. Inspect `bassDev`: zero on > 98 % of frames.

**Minimum reproducer:** any Spotify-tap session captured after the `active` transition. The transient amplitudes vary per session but the AGC-pulling behavior is reproducible.

Statistical summary across the remaining 3 792 post-active frames:

```
bass mean   = 0.225    bass max     = 12.822    pct(bass > 0.5)    =  1.8 %
mid  mean   = 0.059    mid  max     =  1.051    pct(mid  > 0.2)    =  5.5 %

bassDev fires (≥ 0.05): 1.6 % of frames
beatComposite mean = 0.600  (beat detection unaffected — it operates on flux, not amplitude)
```

`session.log` confirms the transient lands exactly at the `active` transition:

```log
[22:58:43Z] signal quality → red: no signal — check output device / app is playing
[22:58:44Z] audio signal → suspect
[22:58:45Z] audio signal → silent
[22:58:47Z] audio signal → recovering
[22:58:47Z] audio signal → active
[... transient spikes at frames 253–262 follow within ~0.3 s ...]
```

The Spotify in-app volume was at 50 % during this capture, which independently lowers the steady-state per-band values (see BUG-026). The startup-transient → AGC-poisoning interaction is separate from the user-settable level issue: even at correct Spotify volume the cold-start transient would still poison the EMA.

**Confirmation session (Spotify at 100 %, 2026-06-02):** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-02T01-12-51Z/`. With the Spotify volume cause from BUG-026 resolved, the raw tap level rose by 16 dB (Peak -4.8 dB, RMS -18.4 dB — healthy mastered-audio range; `session.log` confirms `signal quality → green: peak -6 dBFS, treble 0.06% — OK`). The cold-start transient is unchanged: frames 310-321 immediately after `active` show bass = 3.3 → 6.6 → 10.9 → 11.4 → 10.97 → 11.58 → 10.45 → 10.07 → 9.09 → 8.55 → 7.92 → 7.33 (peak 11.58 at frame 315 — same shape and magnitude as the previous session's 11.0 peak at frame 262). The AGC EMA absorbs these and the rest-of-session statistics are essentially identical:

```
bass mean   = 0.260  (was 0.225 at 50 %; 16 dB louder input → only 16 % bump in mean)
bass max    = 11.58  (was 12.82; cold-start spike same magnitude regardless of input level)
bassRel mean = -0.48  (was negative too; EMA poisoned identically)
pct(bassRel in [-0.1, +0.1]) = 2.8 %  (should be ~50 % at AGC convergence)
bassDev fires (≥ 0.05): 1.8 %  (was 1.6 %; deviation routing structurally dead)
post-startup bass distribution:
  < 0.1: 2.8 %   0.1–0.3: 72.0 %   0.3–0.5: 23.6 %   ≥ 0.5: 1.7 %
```

This isolates BUG-025 from BUG-026: even at healthy signal level the AGC starves all deviation-driven routing. The deviation primitives (Layer-2 in the Audio Data Hierarchy, the canonical "above-average" drivers per D-026) are effectively non-functional on every Spotify session that includes the `silent → active` transition.

---

### Suspected failure class

`calibration` — the AGC EMA does not protect itself against startup transients that bypass the "active" signal-detection gate. Possibilities for the spike source: FFT buffer-fill ringing in the first 1–2 windows after `active`; sample-rate-converter ramp at the tap boundary; or process-tap initial buffer carrying stale data from a prior session. Determining which is part of the fix.

**Evidence for this class:** the spikes are present in the AGC-input band energies but the underlying raw waveform amplitudes (per `raw_tap.wav` astats) are smoothly increasing — the spike is amplification by the AGC pipeline, not the source signal. The behavior is reproducible across sessions and lasts the entire session because the EMA decay time is long relative to a session.

---

### Verification criteria

When this defect is resolved, the following must all pass:

- [ ] **Automated:** new test asserting that on a fixture session (recorded `features.csv` + `raw_tap.wav` from a real Spotify session), `pct(bassDev > 0.05)` over the post-active frames exceeds 20 % (sanity floor — most music passes 30–50 %).
- [ ] **Automated:** new test asserting that the AGC EMA running-average state after the `active` transition is bounded by some multiple (TBD: 3×?) of the prior-window median, rejecting transient values above that threshold or warming up the EMA from a clean state.
- [ ] **Domain-specific artifact:** `features.csv` from a fresh Spotify-tap session (any playlist) shows `bassRel` distribution roughly centred on zero across the post-active session, not structurally negative.
- [ ] **Manual:** Matt confirms a deviation-driven preset (Volumetric Lithograph, Aurora Veil, or post-fix Dragon Bloom) reads as appropriately reactive across a multi-track Spotify session — *not* "dim for the whole session."

**Manual validation required:** Yes. The numerical gates above prove the pipeline correction; the manual check proves the preset experience improved.

---

### Fix scope

Contained — the change lives in `MIRPipeline` / the AGC EMA implementation. Candidate approaches: (a) reject samples > N× current running average from the EMA update on the first M frames after `active`; (b) warm up the running average from a clean zero state for the first N frames after `active`, accepting low / no normalisation during that window; (c) add a one-shot "transient suppression" window immediately after `silent` → `active` that gates the AGC from updating until the input settles. Any approach must preserve the existing AGC behavior under steady-state input (regression-locked by the existing acceptance suite).

### BUG-026 — Quiet-tap-signal UX gap: no warning when input signal level is structurally insufficient (2026-06-01)

**Severity:** P2 (does not affect correctness; degrades the first-session experience for any user whose Spotify in-app volume slider is below 100 % or whose macOS output level is reduced. Cost surfaced when a preset author spent ~3 hours debugging a Spotify-reactivity report whose root cause was a 50 % Spotify volume slider.)
**Domain tag:** session.ux
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-11 (PUB.3 reconciliation) — **fixed by ASH.2 (D-184)**, which shipped exactly this surface: a once-per-session `band=low` toast off `SignalHealthMonitor` (Spotify-specific "Normalize Volume" copy when the source is Spotify), M7-signed-off by Matt 2026-07-10 (fires once, names the remediation, no re-fire after correction). The specced RMS threshold became the ASH.1 peak-band classification.
**Introduced:** Pre-dates session UX work — has been present since the process-tap path was first wired (Phase 1 / 2).
**Resolved:** 2026-07-11, by ASH.2 (D-184; PlaybackErrorBridge health toast).

### Expected behavior

When the process tap is delivering audio whose RMS sits at a level too low to drive useful AGC convergence or perceptible preset reactivity (e.g. RMS < −25 dB after the `active` transition), Phosphene should warn the user via a non-blocking chrome toast: *"Input signal is very quiet — check that Spotify volume (in-app slider) is at 100 % and macOS output volume is normal. Phosphene is post-mixer; your hardware monitor knob can be loud while the tap sees a quiet signal."* The toast should fire once per session after the steady-state RMS is established (e.g. 5 s after `active`).

### Actual behavior

The existing `signal quality` detector emits `red: no signal` → `suspect` → `silent` → `recovering` → `active` based on whether ANY signal is present (it gates on something close to absolute-zero). It does not distinguish "active and at normal level" from "active and structurally too quiet." Once the detector reads `active`, the session proceeds as if the signal is healthy. No toast is shown. The user perceives the symptom (presets unreactive) without any pointer to the cause.

Common upstream causes the user could fix if they were told:
- **Spotify in-app volume slider below 100 %** — extremely common because the Apogee / monitor-controller workflow encourages controlling final loudness in hardware. The user can have a loud monitor and a quiet Spotify slider simultaneously and not realise it. (This was the cause Matt hit on 2026-06-01: Spotify slider at 50 %, monitor cranked.)
- **macOS system volume reduced** — relevant when the output device is the built-in DAC (not an external interface with hardware volume).
- **Spotify Normalize Volume = On** — documented in CLAUDE.md FA #30 but no in-app surface for it.
- **Source app is muted at the app level (some apps have per-app volume in macOS Audio MIDI Setup).**

### Reproduction steps

1. Open Spotify; set the in-app volume slider to ≈ 50 %.
2. Start a Phosphene session against a Spotify playlist with the Apogee Duet 3 (or similar external interface) as the output, monitor knob at normal listening level.
3. Audio plays at correct loudness through the monitor. `session.log` shows `audio signal → active`. No warning toast appears.
4. Observe in `features.csv`: `bass` mean stays ≈ 0.22 (well below the ≈ 0.5 AGC convergence target); preset reactivity is visibly diminished.

**Minimum reproducer:** the Dragon Bloom debug session referenced in BUG-025 (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-01T22-57-10Z`) is one reproducer; any session captured with Spotify slider < 75 % reproduces.

---

### Session artifacts

**Session directory:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-01T22-57-10Z/`

`raw_tap.wav` astats summary (compare to typical streaming-mastered audio at peak ≈ −1 dB / RMS ≈ −14 dB):

```
Peak level  dB: −21.5
RMS  level  dB: −34.8
RMS  peak   dB: −29.8
DC offset:   −0.000004   (within float-rounding noise — clean)
NaN / Inf / denormal: 0   (audio data is well-formed)
```

The DC offset and clean numerics confirm the tap path is operating correctly; the level is the issue. `session.log` shows the `signal quality → active` transition fired despite the signal being 20 dB below useful range:

```log
[22:58:47Z] audio signal → recovering
[22:58:47Z] audio signal → active
[... no warning about the level ...]
```

---

### Suspected failure class

`session.ux` — the diagnostic information exists in the pipeline (running RMS is trivially computable from the existing tap-buffer code), but the UX path that would surface it to the user is missing. Adjacent class: `calibration` — the `signal quality` detector's `active` threshold is "non-zero," not "perceptually adequate."

**Evidence for this class:** the underlying tap is delivering well-formed PCM (verified by `raw_tap.wav` astats); the AGC produces valid (though low-amplitude) per-band energies; no pipeline component is broken. Adding the warning is a pure UX addition.

---

### Verification criteria

When this defect is resolved, the following must all pass:

- [ ] **Automated:** unit test on `SignalQualityClassifier` (or wherever the toast fires) verifying that on a synthetic tap input at RMS = −30 dB sustained, the "low input" toast fires within 5 s of `active`.
- [ ] **Automated:** the toast does NOT fire on a normal-level fixture (RMS ≈ −14 dB).
- [ ] **Domain-specific artifact:** `session.log` from a fresh quiet-tap session (Spotify at 50 % volume) contains a log line indicating the warning was emitted, with the measured RMS dB.
- [ ] **Manual:** the toast text reads clearly, references Spotify in-app volume AND macOS output volume, and dismisses cleanly. It does NOT overlap with other chrome elements during the `.connecting` → `.playing` transition.

**Manual validation required:** Yes. UX wording and dismissal behavior are subjective.

---

### Fix scope

Small — extend the existing `SignalQualityClassifier` (or equivalent) with an `activeButTooQuiet` state, surface it through the same chrome toast path that handles other capture warnings. Threshold selection (which RMS level is "too quiet") needs one calibration measurement against a known-good LF session and a known-quiet Spotify session — the −25 dB number above is a draft, not the final tuning. Sits naturally inside a small Phase U / Phase QR follow-up; not blocking any other increment.

### Related

- Failed Approach: FA #30 (Spotify Normalize Volume) — same family of "user setting upstream of Phosphene that affects signal level"; the toast text should mention it.
- Decision: none yet.
- Increment: Dragon Bloom Spike 1 follow-up debug (2026-06-01) — the cost surfaced during that session is the motivation.
- BUG-025 — Compounds with this bug; until BUG-026's toast lands, users have no clue why their input is quiet, and even if their input were a healthy level BUG-025 could still poison the AGC at the `active` transition.

### BUG-053 — Live MIR was frozen at a hardcoded 48 kHz, ignoring the actual capture rate (2026-06-16)

**Severity:** P2 (masked at 48 kHz; mis-mapped chroma/key + bands at 44.1 kHz — including normal local-file playback of 44.1 kHz files) · **Domain tag:** sample-rate / dsp
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-16** — fix `91a973e` (CLEAN.3.7-fix) + observability `c68cc74`, on `main` (merge `6b23286`; pushed origin `8b80717`). **Validated by Matt:** session `2026-06-16T20-22-12Z` (Limo Wreck, 44.1 kHz local-file playback) logged `raw tap capture started sr=44100 Hz` + `MIR analysis rate → 44100 Hz (tap 44100 Hz)` — the live MIR adopted the file's real rate (not the frozen 48 kHz default). Filed by CLEAN.3.7a (GAP-2 trace), which refuted the pre-kickoff "streaming MIR already rate-aware" assumption.

**Symptom.** The live `MIRPipeline` was constructed once at app init with the `sampleRate: Float = 48000` default, and `process()` carried no rate, so its four sub-analyzers kept 48 kHz bin→Hz tables regardless of the real capture rate. The FFT's per-call rate only set `FFTResult` metadata (the magnitude array is rate-independent), and the captured `tapSampleRate` was wired to the stem path but never the live MIR. At 44.1 kHz: chroma/key ~1.5 semitones sharp, band cutoffs ~8.8 % low (the normalized centroid/mood cancelled out; tempo/flux rate-independent). The offline session-prep MIR was already correct.

**Fix.** Each rate-sensitive sub-analyzer (`SpectralAnalyzer`/`BandEnergyProcessor`/`ChromaExtractor`/`BeatDetector`) gained an in-place `setSampleRate(_:)` (recomputes bin→Hz tables under lock, preserves running state); `MIRPipeline.setSampleRate` (same-file extension) forwards to the four + recomputes its Nyquist; `VisualizerEngine+Audio.processAnalysisFrame` calls it with the captured `tapSampleRate` on the analysis queue — a no-op at 48 kHz, a recompute on a 44.1 kHz path / device-swap (couples to G1). Paired the hardcoded 24 kHz mood-centroid divisor → live Nyquist (so mood stays unchanged while the raw centroid becomes honest). Gate: `MIRSampleRateReconfigureTests` (GPU-free). `c68cc74` persists `MIR analysis rate → <hz> Hz` to `session.log` — that line is the validation signal (key estimation is unreliable, see BUG-054). Doc reconcile: `Protocols.swift`, ARCHITECTURE §Sample-rate contract. `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-16-g]`.

### BUG-052 — Engine tests play (choppy) love_rehab through the device output (2026-06-15)

**Severity:** P3 (test hygiene — no product/correctness impact) · **Domain tag:** test-isolation
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-15** — collapsed single-increment (trivial-P3 path: <5 lines, root cause obvious, no architectural risk; Matt's call "a is the fix"). Fix in this commit.

**Symptom.** During `swift test` (engine suite — e.g. `closeout_evidence.sh` step 1) an extremely choppy fragment of `love_rehab.m4a` plays through the developer's output device, timed with test runs. `SessionLifecycleChurnTests` (REVIEW.2, not env-gated) drives the **real** `.localFilePlayback` path — `AudioInputRouter.start(mode: .localFilePlayback(love_rehab))` + `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` directly — which connects an `AVAudioPlayerNode` to `engine.mainMixerNode` and runs the engine in real-time output mode (audible *by design* — it is the LF "open a file → it plays" feature). The churn test rapidly starts/stops/cancels, so playback restarts from the top repeatedly = choppy.

**Fix.** `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.startPlayback` zeroes `engine.mainMixerNode.outputVolume` when running under XCTest (`NSClassFromString("XCTestCase") != nil`). The analysis tap is on the **player** node (pre-mixer), so muting the mixer output silences the device without altering the captured signal or the start/stop/cancel lifecycle the churn test validates. `SessionLifecycleChurnTests` stays green (6/6); production playback is unaffected (XCTest absent → audible as before). `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-15-f]`.


### BUG-049 — Skein colour-freeze cert gate is session-content-fragile: dominant-stem switch lands beyond the probe canvas extent → deterministic red on data, not code (2026-06-11)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-11 — fix commit `a6899893`; armed-path validation COMPLETED the same evening via fixture-generated real captures (parallel session).** The "blocked on a real capture" gap below was closed by `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` (engine test target, `Diagnostics/`): env-gated, it runs vendored tempo fixtures (`love_rehab` / `so_what` / `there_there`, 30 s each) through the PRODUCTION pipeline — ffmpeg decode → `StemSeparator` (MPSGraph, 10 s chunks) → `StemAnalyzer` per 1024-hop (the `SessionPreparer.warmUpAndAnalyze` framing) → `SessionRecorder.csvRow` — and writes real stems.csv captures (FA #27-compliant; nothing hand-authored). Usage: `PHOSPHENE_GEN_SESSION_DIR="$HOME/Documents/phosphene_sessions" swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator`. **Validation results (2026-06-11 ~21:50–21:57):** criteria 1a/1b — with three `fixturegen-*` captures in the live dir, the gate ARMED (`picked fixturegen-so_what: stemA=2 lead 0.0316, stemB=1 lead 0.0226`) and SkeinCanvasHold ran 21/21 GREEN with 8+ recorder stubs simultaneously present; criterion 2 — with the freeze deliberately broken in `skeinLineLookupAt` (every τ takes the LATEST breakpoint colour, the literal Skein.4.1 recolour defect), the gate went RED on its headline assertion (PRE-switch X=0 Y=61); reverted → green (X=61 Y=0). Empty-dir leg: loud skip, green. The `fixturegen-*` captures stay IN PLACE so the armed path no longer depends on listening-session happenstance (regenerable with the one command; `session.log` records provenance). The original `13-10-42Z`-only criterion was unrunnable as written (capture deleted before any session could validate against it); the fixture-generated set substitutes.
>
> Original fix banner (fix session, same evening): **FIX LANDED 2026-06-11 (commit `a6899893`) — armed-path validation PENDING the next real session capture.** Single fix increment per the P2 process (root cause + verification criteria documented at filing, below; test-infrastructure-only, one test file). Three changes in `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift`: (1) the colour-freeze gate applies the line-792 sampling-window feasibility check DURING candidate selection — a CPU-only dry run (`switchSampleInfeasibility`) replays each candidate's tick sequence (tick never reads the GPU back, so it predicts the live run's windows exactly) and the scan walks candidates in decisiveness order, picking the most decisive switch that is ALSO sample-able; the in-run guard stays as a dry-run/live parity safety net. (2) When NO candidate arms (stub-only or otherwise unusable session sets), the gate skips LOUDLY with session/candidate counts + per-candidate rejection reasons — never red on session-set content (criterion 1), never a silent skip. (3) The Skein.3 real-stem routing gate (the same fragility's second face — red whenever the LARGEST session is a 602-byte stub) now scans all sessions for the first with usable frames and likewise skips loudly. The colour-freeze assertions themselves (pre-switch X≫Y, post-switch Y≫X, jump magnitude, new-pour-not-on-old-path) are untouched. **Validation status:** criterion 1's unusable-set arm is met (suite 21/21 green on the current stub-only set; both gates print their skip reasons); criteria 1a/1b (gate ARMS and passes on the real capture set) and 2 (adversarial colour-unfrozen A/B) are BLOCKED — the only real capture (`2026-06-11T13-10-42Z`, 2.98 MB) disappeared from `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions` between the 19:49 filing and the fix session (~21:30); only 11 header-only stubs remain, and the capture is unrecoverable from the fix session's environment (Trash TCC-denied; no quarantine copy, no snapshot). **After the next real listening session, re-run `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SkeinCanvasHold`: expect `[skein_colorfreeze] picked …` (armed) and green, then run the criterion-2 A/B. If the parity safety net fires instead, the dry run and the live loop diverged — restore parity, do not widen the windows.**

**Severity:** P2 (the engine suite is red on every full run, so the closeout evidence battery cannot produce ALL GREEN for unrelated increments; no runtime impact).

**Domain tag:** test infrastructure / failure class `test-isolation` (session-content dependence).

**Expected.** The colour-freeze gate ("Line colour is frozen per-segment … — live path", `SkeinCanvasHoldTest.swift:792`) passes on a green tree regardless of which session captures happen to exist in `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions`.

**Actual.** Deterministic failure, identical numbers across 5+ runs: `Switch landed too close to a pour boundary to sample (preLo=7.652855 preHi=8.052645 postLo=8.161678 postHi=5.8849607)`. The selected session's dominant-stem switch sits at τ≈8.05 while the probe canvas only extends to probeTau≈5.88 (`postHi = min(switch+25·dtau, probeTau) < postLo`) — the sampling guard `Issue.record`s instead of skipping to another candidate switch or session.

**Reproduction / artifacts.** `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter SkeinCanvasHold`, 2026-06-11 evening; session dir contains `2026-06-11T13-10-42Z` (2.98 MB stems.csv — the only non-stub capture) plus five 602-byte stub captures from the day's app/test runs. Fails identically at HEAD (`31bb8307`) and at `4b83b4ef` (whose 19:02 evidence battery ran the same suite GREEN) — the engine-source diff between the green and red runs is EMPTY, proving environment-not-code. Quarantining the post-19:02 stub sessions does NOT clear it; the precise session-set delta between 19:02 and 19:49 could not be reconstructed (a capture present at 19:02 may have since changed or been removed — unverified). Evidence blocks: `~/.phosphene/last_closeout_evidence.md` (19:02 green @ `4b83b4ef`, 19:49 red @ `31bb8307`).

**Suspected failure class:** `test-isolation`, two compounding shapes: (1) app-test/battery runs append stub session captures (602-byte stems.csv) into the live `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions` directory engine tests consume — SessionRecorder runs from launch (D-025, archived); (2) the colour-freeze gate trusts its discovered switch location without verifying it is sampleable within the probe extent, and records an Issue instead of iterating — the exact fragility class the test's own `recordedSessionsBySize()` comment names ("a session-fragile gate goes red on data, not code — the Skein.4.1 `distinctBlobs` lesson").

**Verification criteria (written before any fix):** (1) automated — the gate passes with the `13-10-42Z`-only set, with stub sessions present, and with an empty session dir (skip with a printed reason, never silently); (2) manual/adversarial — the gate still FAILS on a deliberately colour-unfrozen canvas (keep its teeth; A/B per the Skein.4 transient-metric lesson).

**Found by:** the RB.2-2 closeout evidence battery (19:49), diagnosed same evening. Not an RB.2-2 regression (docs-only increment).

### BUG-048 — `xcodebuild test` ran the engine test bundle in a runner context that denies subprocess/audio/file access: ~30 environment-class failures on every run, in every terminal (2026-06-11)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-11 (commit `e110b1ca`)** — Single fix increment per the P2 process (root cause documented before code; the fix is one scheme edit + one regression gate). Matt picked the fix option in chat ("scope and run the option-1 increment"). Discovered by the REVIEW.3 closeout evidence script on its first three runs — exactly the defect class the script exists to surface.

**Severity:** P2 (the canonical app-test invocation was permanently red, so a true app regression could not have been distinguished from the noise floor; no runtime impact).

**Domain tag:** test infrastructure / failure class `test-isolation`.

**Expected.** `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test` (the canonical app-test invocation, CLAUDE.md + RUNBOOK §Build and Test) exits 0 on a green tree.

**Actual.** Exit 65 on every run. The scheme's test action had included `PhospheneEngineTests` since U.1; under xcodebuild's test-runner context the engine bundle hits environment denials that `swift test` does not: ffmpeg subprocess spawn fails (`Error opening input: Operation not permitted` on fixture decode), the REVIEW.2 audio churn tests die in ~1 ms, `DocIntegrityTests` reads an empty DECISIONS.md (repo file reads denied — `(!dec.isEmpty → false)`), and only ~440 of the engine suite's 1439 tests load at all. The pure app run (382 tests) passed inside the same invocation.

**Reproduction / artifacts.** Three closeout evidence blocks, 2026-06-11: sandboxed shell (12:14), unsandboxed shell (12:21, commit `03b27340`), and Matt's own terminal (18:59, commit `23298c64`) — identical failure signature in all three, ruling out the shell environment. Blocks archived at `~/.phosphene/last_closeout_evidence.md` per run and in the REVIEW.3 session transcript.

**Suspected → confirmed failure class.** `test-isolation` — the tests are correct; the xcodebuild runner context (sandbox/entitlements of the test host) denies the environment they need. Same family as the FA #66 fixture/live parity gap: two runners, two environments, one suite.

**Fix.** Removed the `PhospheneEngineTests` `TestableReference` from `PhospheneApp.xcscheme`'s test action (option 1, Matt's pick over making the engine bundle xcodebuild-compatible — double-running 1439 tests in a broken environment added noise, not coverage). The engine suite's canonical runner remains `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine`; `xcodebuild test` now means "app tests," which is what the 305/382 baseline always actually measured. Regression-locked by `SchemeTestActionRegressionTests` (engine suite): fails loudly if the engine bundle is re-added to the test action, or if the app test target is ever dropped from it.

**Verification (pre-stated, met).** Automated: `xcodebuild test` exits 0 with `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`, 382 app tests green, no engine-bundle run in the output; the new gate passes; full closeout evidence block at the docs commit. Manual: Matt re-runs `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` from his terminal — the app step should now be green (pending his next run).

### BUG-047 — FFO aurora palette MARCHES through its colour stops second-by-second on mood-wobbly tracks: the orbit azimuth multiplied arousal-speed into the ENTIRE elapsed total, retroactively rescaling history (2026-06-11)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-11 (FBS.S5d)** — found via Matt's So What read ("the color of the ocean was changing every 1-2 seconds… it marches through the palette") after two wrong attributions in-session (mood tint; curtain-vs-base contrast — the latter an R−B metric artifact, see Verification). Trivial-collapse justified: root cause obvious once the per-frame azimuth trajectory was printed (algorithm-class, code contradicts its own design comment), fix < 60 lines across the established driver pattern, no architectural risk.

**Severity:** P2 (character-breaking: the whole ocean visits green/pink/purple second-by-second on affected tracks; violates Matt's directed 8–10 s colour pacing and the round-61 tuned orbit).

**Domain tag:** `preset.fidelity` / failure class `algorithm`.

**Expected.** The aurora curtain's palette position drifts through pink/green/purple at the round-61 pace (~25–37 s per revolution; ≤ ~0.03 palette-t/s), with arousal scaling the orbit SPEED (the round-55 design comment).

**Actual.** `rm_ferrofluidSky` computed `curtainAzimuth = accumulated_audio_time × arousalSpeed(arousal)` — the speed factor multiplied the ENTIRE elapsed total. Any arousal movement retroactively rescaled history: with the mood classifier wobbling per-second on jazz (So What arousal swings ±0.3–0.5/s), the azimuth thrashed ±2+ rad/s and palette-t jumped 0.2–0.3/s across colour stops. The error scales with elapsed accumulated time — track openings looked fine (aat < 1), minute two marched (aat 5–7). Love Rehab's early windows masked it (small aat + steadier mood).

**Reproduction / artifacts.** Session `2026-06-11T13-10-42Z`, So What te 56–80: per-frame azimuth trajectory printed from features.csv (az 12.19 → 10.04 in 1 s; palette zone GREEN→PINK→GREEN→PINK→PURPLE second-by-second); per-second frame-mean hue measured from the video (green +138° → pink −45° → purple −104° within seconds); 12-frame montage confirmed by Matt ("yes, it marches through the palette").

**Fix.** Integrate, don't multiply: `RenderPipeline.auroraOrbitStep` advances `azimuth += arousalSpeed × Δaccumulated-audio-time` per frame (base period 2.5 s verbatim); ships as `StemFeatures.auroraOrbitAzimuth` (float 47); the shader reads it. Track-change resets (negative Δ) advance nothing.

**Verification (pre-stated, met).** Pixel A/B through the forensics replica with a new wrap-aware HUE-ANGLE metric (the prior R−B metric is blind to green↔purple legs — that blindness produced the session's earlier wrong "contrast amplifier" reading): So What 56–80 per-second hue swing **94.7°/s (legacy arm) → 3.3°/s (integrated)**; Love Rehab stays calm-and-alive (4.9°/s). `AuroraOrbitDriverTests`: history-rescale immunity under worst-case wobble at minute-two scale, arousal still scales speed 2×, track-reset holds. Manual: Matt's next live read on So What.

### BUG-046 — Skein's section response rides BUG-042's note-scale junk on streaming material: the confidence gate passes boundaries every ~1.7 s at conf 0.78–0.95 (2026-06-11)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-11 (Skein.6, pre-certification)** — Trivial-collapsed P2 per CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol (one guard + one constant + one regression gate; root cause fully evidenced from the M7 session artifacts before any code; Matt picked the fix option in chat — "Add a section-spacing guard"). Found during the Skein.6 M7 session review; fixed before flipping `certified: true` at Matt's direction ("If anything looks concerning, let's fix it before we certify").

**Severity:** P2 (the certified preset's character silently differs by audio source: on busy streaming material the splatter runs ≈1.6–2.2× the Matt-tuned round-2 rate and pours chop at ~1–1.7 s — the rejected D-150 "lines too short" character — while local-file material keeps the tuned behaviour).

**Domain tag:** `preset.fidelity` / failure class `calibration` (a downstream consumer trusting an upstream signal whose failure mode pins the gate's pass condition).

**Expected behavior.** Skein's structure response (flurry pulse + boundary-forced fresh pour + region lean, D-152) fires on real musical section changes — every 15–60 s — and its confidence gate (smoothstep 0.25→0.55) suppresses detector junk. The Skein.6 cert premise was "the structure sub-feature is conf-gated to zero on BUG-042's junk."

**Actual behavior.** BUG-042 (parked: section-detector note-scale geometry) machine-guns boundaries every ~1.7 s on busy streaming material **at confidence 0.78–0.95** — far above the gate top, so the junk flows through at full strength. The cert premise held on the approved local-file sessions only because the detector stays quiet there (conf ≈ 0). Mechanically: the flurry pulse (τ 2.5 s) is re-armed every ~1.7 s → effectively permanent ≈1.6–2.2× spatter-rate boost; `boundaryPourPending` forces pours at the 1.0 τ floor instead of the 2.65 τ min-dwell.

**Reproduction / artifacts.** M7 session `2026-06-11T01-56-22Z` `features.csv` section columns: `section_index` +6 per 10 s sustained (≈1.7 s cadence), `section_confidence` 0.78–0.95, during both Skein windows. Contrast the approved sessions `2026-06-10T19-48-27Z` / `20-05-48Z`: conf 0.0–0.7, boundaries rare. Replay gate: machine-gun structure (boundary/1.67 s @ conf 0.9) on identical tiled single-dominant real stems → 16 pour breaks / 1650 spawns in 30 s vs the sparse control's 2 / 1091 (A/B-validated by reverting the fix).

**Fix (Matt's pick).** `SkeinState.minSectionSpacingS = 10` wall-seconds: a boundary inside the spacing window of the last ACCEPTED boundary is ignored wholesale (`updateSectionBias`). Wall seconds, not painter τ (τ runs 1.5–2× wall on busy music — the first guard draft used τ and leaked ~6 s spacing). Real section changes (≥ 15 s apart) pass untouched; the guard stays harmless after the eventual BUG-042 detector fix. BUG-042 itself remains OPEN and PARKED — this is a consumer-side robustness guard, not the detector fix.

**Verification (pre-stated, met).** Automated: `test_structure_boundarySpacingGuard` — machine-gun replay → 4 breaks / 1250 spawns (≤ 6 / ≤ 1.5× control; unguarded 16 / 1650 trips both asserts), sparse boundary still lands its fresh pour; the existing `test_structure_boundaryBias` (single confident boundary flurries + leans, low-conf exactly zero) stays green. Manual: next streaming Skein listen — pours stay long and spatter stays at the tuned rate on busy material.

### BUG-045 — FFO aurora hue strobes: vocals-pitch confidence flaps across the hue gate ~9×/s, snapping the reflected sky's colour and stepping whole-frame luminance (2026-06-10)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-10 (FBS.S5, D-158)** — the "remaining flasher" after D-157's regional punches. Diagnosis and fix landed in one session because the fix IS Matt's independently-directed character change ("the aurora color is shifting too quickly… transition over a longer length of time, e.g., 8-10s") — the multi-increment split was honored within the session: forensics-proof commit first (`ef4fb8e0`), fix commit second (`0159c54f`).

**Severity:** P2 (visible whole-frame flashing on FFO mid-track, "prominent on some tracks" — Matt, S4 read of session `2026-06-10T19-13-14Z`).

**Domain tag:** `preset.fidelity` / failure class `calibration` (an ungated per-frame input driving a scene-wide chromatic surface).

**Expected behavior.** The aurora curtain's hue follows the vocal register/mood smoothly; the reflected sky never changes colour at frame rate.

**Actual behavior.** `rm_ferrofluidSky` computed the palette phase per-pixel from raw `vocals_pitch_hz`/`vocals_pitch_confidence`. On real music the confidence crosses the smoothstep(0.5, 0.7) gate ~9×/s (90 crossings in the 10 s So What window), snapping the phase between the pitch path and the valence fallback — up to 0.4 of palette phase, across palette stops (pink↔green↔purple differ ~2× in luma). At curtain intensity 2.5–5.5 mirrored across the whole substrate, each snap stepped the entire frame's mean luminance (video: 72–84-luma flashes).

**Reproduction / artifacts.** `FerrofluidFlashForensicsTests` on session `2026-06-10T19-13-14Z`: replicating the pitch fields took the replica 1 → 13 flash steps (So What seg2 31–41 s) and 0 → 15 (Lotus seg5 45–51 s); the new `PHOSPHENE_FLASH_ABLATE=aurora-hue` arm (zeroing only those two fields) restored 1 / 0 — the route is convicted mechanically, not by input correlation.

**Fix (D-158).** The same composite phase math runs CPU-side (`RenderPipeline.auroraHueStep`, pure fn) behind a τ ≈ 3 s EMA — gate flapping averages to a stable intermediate hue; a sustained vocal entry glides the hue over ~9 s (Matt's directed window). Shipped to the shader as `StemFeatures.auroraPalettePhase` (float 45); the shader reads one smoothed value. Companion (same directive): `auroraDriverStep` intensity τ rise/fall 0.45/1.2 → 2.7/3.3 s.

**Verification (pre-stated, met).** Automated: the four forensics windows re-rendered post-fix → 1/0/1/0 flash steps with localized punch deltas preserved; `AuroraHueDriverTests` pins flap immunity (≤ 0.005/frame under worst-case flapping), the 8–10 s step response, and converged-target fidelity to the pre-S5 shader formula. Manual: **Matt's live read of `2026-06-10T20-26-37Z` CONFIRMS the hue fix** — "some remaining flashing happening, but mostly gone" (census: 79 → 13 events/154 s; zero trace to the hue). The residual cold-start events were ablation-attributed to the global bridge heave (a D-158-amendment design question, not this defect); 3 unreproducible one-frame blips suspected video-encode, parked.

### BUG-044 — Local-file next/prev/EOF never wipes the Skein canvas: one painting accumulates across every track (2026-06-10)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-10** — Trivial-collapsed P2 per CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol (root cause obvious from the session log + a one-helper extraction, no architectural risk; collapse stated explicitly here and in the commit). Landed on the Skein.5.4 branch `claude/skein54-splatter`; reaches main with the 5.4 merge.

**Severity:** P2 (preset contract violation: the §1.5 "a new track paints its OWN canvas" / §5.7 "same song → same painting" properties silently break for every local-file session with more than one track; pre-existing on main since Skein.3 — newly observed because 5.4's eyeball-gate listen was the first multi-track LF Skein session).

**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring` (the BUG-024 complementary-path class: per-track preset state reset on the streaming path only).

**Expected behavior.** On any track change — streaming metadata callback OR local-file next/prev/natural-EOF advance — an active Skein wipes the canvas to the new track's palette ground and re-seeds the painter from the new track's identity (Skein.3 §1.5 + 5.3b), and an active Nimbus settles (NB.4).

**Actual behavior.** Local-file advances (`advanceLocalFileQueue`) never wiped: the LF.5.fix.2-FU3 "mirror the streaming callback's destructive resets" block predates Skein.3, and the Skein wipe (added 2026-06-05) + Nimbus settle were only ever wired in the streaming callback (`VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift`). The painting accumulated across tracks; the wipe the user saw at the first transition was the preset-APPLY clear, not a track-change wipe.

**Reproduction.** LF session ≥ 2 tracks, Skein active, press next: canvas keeps the previous track's paint. Session `2026-06-10T19-48-27Z` (the evidence artifact): Skein active continuously from 19:51:15; five `resetStemPipeline caller=trackChange` advances (19:51:27 → 19:52:00) with zero wipes; no `preset → Skein` re-apply between them.

**Fix.** Extract the per-track preset-state reset (Nimbus settle + Skein reseed → ground override → `clearMVWarpCanvasToGround`) into the shared `VisualizerEngine.resetPerTrackPresetState()`, called from BOTH paths. On the LF path it runs AFTER `applyLocalFileTrackState` (the Skein reseed derives from `lastResolvedTrackIdentity`, which that helper sets) and logs a `WIRING:` breadcrumb so the next session artifact verifies it.

**Verification criteria (pre-stated).** Automated: `TrackChangePresetResetRegressionTests` — the helper exists once, both call sites invoke it, neither re-inlines the wipe, and the LF call is ordered after the identity apply. Manual: next multi-track LF listen — every next/prev wipes to a fresh ground (the session.log shows `advanceLocalFileQueue resetPerTrackPresetState COMPLETE` per advance).


### BUG-033 — App layer: per-frame `@Published dashboardSnapshot` invalidates the whole SwiftUI tree at 60 Hz; `assign(to:on: self)` retain cycles leak view models (2026-06-09)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-14 — fix `f95d645` ([CLEAN.1.4]); integrated to `main` + pushed as `da26a3a`; manual validation completed (Matt, Activity Monitor overlay-on/off toggle).** (1) The per-frame dashboard snapshot flows through a dedicated `CurrentValueSubject` (`dashboardSnapshotSubject`), **not** `@Published` on the engine — no more 60 Hz whole-tree SwiftUI invalidation; the publish is skipped while the overlay is hidden (the default). (2) Both VMs' `assign(to:on: self)` → `sink { [weak self] }`, breaking the retain cycles (VMs now `deinit`).

**Severity:** P1 (steady main-thread burn for the entire duration of every playback session + unbounded VM leak at frame rate).
**Domain tag:** app.ui / performance / leak
**Status:** Resolved — automated (VM deinit tests) + manual (Matt's overlay-toggle CPU check) criteria met. The high *absolute* CPU Matt observed during the check is a separate finding — the always-on session recorder, filed **BUG-050** — not this defect.
**Introduced:** dashboard snapshot pump (dashboard increment); `assign(to:on:)` subscriptions in VM inits.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-14 — commit `f95d645` ([CLEAN.1.4]: dashboard snapshot off `@Published` → `CurrentValueSubject` + skip-when-hidden; VM `sink { [weak self] }`), integrated to main as `da26a3a`.

**Expected:** hidden diagnostics cost nothing; view models deallocate when their views go away.
**Actual (pre-fix):** the per-frame dashboard snapshot was `@Published` on the `@EnvironmentObject`-wide engine → `objectWillChange` re-evaluated the whole SwiftUI tree at ~60 Hz throughout playback; and both VMs' `assign(to:on:self)` subscriptions retained `self` → the VMs never deallocated (one chrome VM leaked per session).
**Suspected failure class:** `resource-management`.
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: VM deallocation tests (weak ref nils after teardown) — `SessionStateViewTests.deallocates_noRetainCycle` + `PlaybackChromeViewModelTests.deallocates_noRetainCycle` (red pre-fix via `assign`, green post-fix via `sink [weak self]`).
- [x] Dashboard writes go through a non-`@Published` subject (`dashboardSnapshotSubject`), publish skipped when the overlay is hidden.
- [x] Manual: Matt's Activity Monitor check — toggling the overlay produces the expected CPU swing (the decoupling working); the residual high CPU traced to the separate recorder cost (BUG-050), not this path.

### BUG-038 — Ray-march light-intensity flickers 7–9 steps/sec (BUG-019 residual: beat-onset brightness term fires ~97% of frames) (2026-06-09)

**Severity:** P1 (chronic visible artifact across all ray-march presets; the symptom Matt has reported "since FFO existed" — a strobe that blocks fair evaluation of FFO and any beat-sync work). Continuation of **BUG-019** (PERF.3 reduced it 76→53–60 oscillation events but did not eliminate it).
**Domain tag:** `renderer` (light-intensity modulation) + `dsp.beat` (beat-onset signals near-constant).
**Status:** **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (Matt's M7 passed, session `15-10-28Z`).** Fix on `main` (commit `5c349eb`, `RayMarchPipeline.smoothLightIntensity` EMA, τ ≈ 0.12 s). Removed from the Open Index.
**Introduced:** structural — `applyAudioModulation` (`RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift`, preset-agnostic for all ray-march presets) set light intensity = `base × (1 + f.bass·0.4 + beatAccent·0.15)` *per frame with no temporal smoothing*. `beatAccent = max(beatBass, beatMid, beatComposite)` fires on ~97% of frames on real sessions (a near-constant jitter, not clean beats), and `f.bass` is noisy → the whole scene's brightness steps frame-to-frame.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-17 — Matt's M7 (session `2026-06-17T15-10-28Z`, Ferrofluid Ocean on real audio, ~220 s) confirms steady ray-march lighting, no strobe. Data corroborates: the **raw** brightness target in `features.csv` still steps **8.0/sec** (the jitter SOURCE is unchanged — `features.csv` records the raw FeatureVector, upstream of the in-shader EMA), yet the rendered output is steady → the EMA (`smoothLightIntensity`) suppresses a real ~8/sec jitter into a steady light uniform, mean-preserving (brightness still follows the energy swell). Closes the BUG-019 flicker lineage. Fix commit `5c349eb`.

**Expected:** scene brightness is steady, brightening/dimming smoothly with the music's energy — no per-frame stepping/strobe.

**Actual (sessions `2026-06-09T21-23-07Z` streaming + `21-19-14Z` clean local):** the light multiplier takes a perceptible single-frame step (|Δ| > 0.05) **7–9 times/sec on every streaming track and ~7/sec on clean-signal Cherub**; the beat-onset term fires on **96–98% of frames** (near-constant, not on beats). Visible as a constant light flicker (Matt flagged it on Lotus Flower and "some other tracks"). Present on clean signal too → not a weak-signal artifact.

**Reproduction steps:** play any session; per frame compute `1 + clamp(bass)·0.4 + clamp(max(beatBass,beatMid,beatComposite))·0.15` from `features.csv`; count frames with frame-to-frame |Δ| > 0.05 → ~8/sec. (`tools/fbs/` brightness analysis.)

**Session artifacts:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-06-09T21-23-07Z/features.csv` (all 6 streaming tracks), `21-19-14Z/features.csv` (Cherub clean). Beat-term firing rate 96–98%.

**Suspected failure class:** `render-state` (no temporal smoothing on a per-frame light uniform) compounded by `algorithm` (beat-onset signals near-constant, so they add jitter not beats).

**Fix (FBS pre-step):** temporally smooth the light multiplier with an EMA (`RayMarchPipeline.smoothLightIntensity`, τ ≈ 0.12 s) before writing the light uniform. Drops perceptible steps **~8/sec → ~0** (verified on all 4 sessions) while preserving the slower musical brightness swell. **Mean-preserving + preset-agnostic → no certified-preset (Nimbus) regression**; the PERF.3 formula is unchanged, only low-passed. First frame after preset-load/stall (`dt ≤ 0`) returns the target verbatim → no startup lag and single-frame golden hashes unchanged.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] **Automated (pure-function):** `RayMarchPipelineTests.test_smoothLightIntensity_suppressesFrameToFrameFlicker` — synthetic jittery target (mimics the 97%-firing beat + bass noise) → smoothed output < 5 steps over 600 frames (raw > 400), still tracks the slow swell. `_firstFrameHasNoLag` covers `dt ≤ 0`.
- [x] **Regression:** `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes unchanged (single-frame, dt=0 = target = pre-fix value); full ray-march/FFO/acceptance suites green.
- [x] **Manual (M7):** Matt confirms FFO no longer flickers — steady lighting through a continuous-playback session. **PASSED 2026-06-17** (session `15-10-28Z`; raw target still 8.0/sec, render steady).

**Manual validation required:** Yes — it's a felt visual artifact; only a human can confirm the strobe is gone.

**Related:**
- **BUG-019** — the original beat-dominant-brightness flicker (`0.4 + beatPulse·2.6`); PERF.3 fixed the worst of it but left this residual (still had a beat term + no smoothing). This is its continuation.
- **FBS** (Ferrofluid Beat Sync) — done as the pre-step so FFO has a steady baseline to evaluate the new beat pulse against (Matt's call, 2026-06-09). The noisy beat-onset signals are also *why* FBS times its pulse off the steady tempo grid, not these signals.
- **Worktree → build (SUPERSEDED 2026-06-17):** the fix **reached `main`** (commit `5c349eb`; `smoothLightIntensity` is in `origin/main`'s `RayMarchPipeline`) and is on the current build — **M7-ready now.** (The original note — fix on branch `claude/intelligent-shirley-1ce3b4`, not on main — no longer applies.)

### BUG-031 — StemSeparator shared between live pipeline and session preparer with unlocked I/O: cross-path stem corruption (2026-06-09)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-14 — fix `1447612` ([CLEAN.1.2], strategy A — Matt-approved); integrated to `main` + pushed as `da26a3a`; manual validation completed via Matt's sessions `2026-06-14T17-22-31Z` (local) + `2026-06-14T17-58-44Z` (streaming).** The full input→predict→output critical section on the single shared `StemSeparator` is now atomic under one lock, and stems are returned BY VALUE (`StemSeparationResult.stemWaveforms`) so callers never read the shared `stemBuffers`.

**Severity:** P1 (silent stem corruption → poisoned orchestrator stem-affinity scoring; plausible contributor to the BUG-012 family).
**Domain tag:** dsp.stem / concurrency
**Status:** Resolved — automated (`StemSeparatorConcurrencyTests` + `tsan_stress.sh`) + manual (Matt's two sessions) criteria met.
**Introduced:** progressive readiness (Inc 6.1) made prep-during-playback the normal case; the BUG-012 race analysis only covered the serial `stemQueue`, never the preparer path.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-14 — commit `1447612` ([CLEAN.1.2]: lock the full `separate()` pipeline + return stems by value), integrated to main as `da26a3a`.

**Expected:** stem separation results are isolated per caller.
**Actual (pre-fix):** one shared `StemSeparator`; `separate()` wrote model inputs and read outputs outside the only lock (`predict()`), and both callers read the shared `stemBuffers` unlocked → overlapping live+prep calls interleaved (call A's `predict` consumed call B's input; A then read B's stems).
**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency`.
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: `StemSeparatorConcurrencyTests.concurrentSeparations_returnPerCallerOwnStems` (threshold-free cross-caller discriminator; A/B-RED by reverting the lock).
- [x] TSan: `Scripts/tsan_stress.sh` (CLEAN.1.6) — overlapping live+prep `separate()` on one shared instance, **0 data races**.
- [x] Manual: Matt's real sessions (`17-22-31Z` local, `17-58-44Z` streaming) — stems feel musically connected; recorded per-stem deviation is live (drums/bass/vocals range >1.5 over a mid-streaming window); no stall/deadlock/crash.

### BUG-032 — Streaming session lifecycle: `endSession()` orphans the prep task; stale prep can hijack the next session; recovery spawns a second concurrent prep loop (2026-06-09)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-14 — fix `4762114` ([CLEAN.1.3]); integrated to `main` + pushed as `da26a3a`; manual validation completed via Matt's sessions `2026-06-14T17-22-31Z` + `2026-06-14T17-58-44Z`.** All three defects fixed: `endSession()` cancels `sessionPreparationTask`/`statusCancellable`; a per-instance `streamingSessionGen` (twin of `localFileSessionGen`) gates the prep-completion closure so an orphan can't mutate the new session; `resumeFailedNetworkTracks` is single-flight; both `startSession` variants mutate the published source only after the state guard.

**Severity:** P1 (next session's plan overwritten with the old playlist + flipped `.ready` prematurely; two `_runPreparation` loops over the single StemSeparator — compounded BUG-031).
**Domain tag:** session.lifecycle / concurrency
**Status:** Resolved — automated (`SessionLifecycleGenerationTests` + `SessionRecoverySingleFlightTests` + `tsan_stress.sh`) + manual (Matt's two sessions) criteria met.
**Introduced:** structural — predates LF.5's generation-guard pattern; the streaming path never got the equivalent.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-14 — commit `4762114` ([CLEAN.1.3]: streaming session-generation guard + lifecycle teardown + single-flight recovery), integrated to main as `da26a3a`.

**Expected:** ending a session cancels its preparation; a new session is unaffected by the old one's in-flight work; recovery resumes within the existing loop.
**Actual (pre-fix):** `endSession()` left the prep task live; the orphan's completion overwrote the next session's `currentPlan`/state; `resumeFailedNetworkTracks` spawned a second `_runPreparation`; `startSession` mutated the published source before the state guard.
**Suspected failure class:** `concurrency` (task lifecycle), `api-contract` (source-before-guard).
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: `SessionLifecycleGenerationTests` (end→restart orphan guard + rejected-startSession source order) + `SessionRecoverySingleFlightTests` (`maxRunPreparationInFlight == 1`).
- [x] TSan: `Scripts/tsan_stress.sh` (CLEAN.1.6) — rapid start/end/cancel churn with prep in flight, **0 data races**.
- [x] Manual: Matt's real sessions — cancel→restart + four source loads (Spotify → local folder → single files), each reaching `→ready` with its OWN correct plan; no orphan-hijack, no premature ready, no crash.

### BUG-030 — Duplicate playlist tracks crash `SessionPreparer.prepare(tracks:)` (2026-06-09)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-12 (fix commit `ba4e1cae`, a cherry-pick of `679363a9` from the stranded `claude/dreamy-bell-23528b` branch onto main during CLEAN.0 baseline reconciliation)** — trivial P1, collapsed per the BUG-030 kickoff (instrument→diagnose→fix→validate in one increment: < 5 lines of behavioural change, root cause obvious from audit §A2, no architectural risk). **Fix shape (A):** both `trackStatuses` builds switched from `Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:)` to `Dictionary(_:uniquingKeysWith:)` (keep the first `.queued`) — at the streaming build in `prepare(tracks:)` and the LF twin in `prepareLocalFiles(…)`. Contract-faithful: the prepare loop still visits both occurrences (the second is a cheap cache hit), so a twice-listed track yields **two** `cachedTracks` entries → two plan slots, honouring `PlaylistConnecting`'s "duplicates preserve their playlist order." Option (B) (dedupe to one slot) was rejected — it would silently drop a playlist position (a product behaviour change, not a crash fix). Two regression tests in `SessionPreparerTests` were confirmed to **trap** against pre-fix code (`Fatal error: Duplicate values for key`) and pass after; the streaming test pins the two-slot contract so an option-(B) refactor fails the gate loudly. Engine suite green (the only fresh-worktree failures were the unfetched `Tests/Fixtures/tempo` clips, restored via `Scripts/fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh`).

**Severity:** P1 (runtime trap → session preparation crash on ordinary input).
**Domain tag:** session.prep
**Status:** Resolved — fix landed 2026-06-12 (`ba4e1cae`); automated criterion met, manual criterion pending Matt's integrated-build run.
**Introduced:** structural — original `trackStatuses` construction.
**Resolved:** 2026-06-12 — commit `ba4e1cae` (cherry-pick of `679363a9`: fix A, `Dictionary(_:uniquingKeysWith:)` at both the streaming and LF `trackStatuses` builds).

**Expected:** a playlist containing the same track twice prepares normally; `PlaylistConnecting`'s doc (`PlaylistConnector.swift:57`) explicitly promises "Duplicate tracks preserve their playlist order."
**Actual (pre-fix):** `SessionPreparer.swift:183` built `trackStatuses = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:)`, which **traps at runtime on duplicate keys**. Duplicate tracks yield identical `TrackIdentity` values; same trap on the LF path (`:256`, an M3U listing the same file twice).
**Reproduction steps:** connect a Spotify playlist containing the same track twice; preparation crashed at dictionary construction. Reproduced automatically by the two regression tests (both trapped pre-fix).
**Session artifacts:** `docs/diagnostics/CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-09.md` §A2 (code-level evidence); pre-fix trap captured on both paths.
**Suspected failure class:** `api-contract` (Dictionary uniqueness precondition vs the connector's documented duplicate-preserving contract).
**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: engine test preparing a track list with an exact-duplicate `TrackIdentity` completes without trapping (streaming + LF paths). — **Met** (confirmed trap pre-fix, green post-fix).
- [ ] Manual: a real Spotify playlist with a duplicated track reaches `.ready`. — **Deferred to Matt's integrated build** (the automated gate is the load-bearing crash-fix proof).

### BUG-012 — MPSGraph EXC_BAD_ACCESS in StemFFTEngine during sustained force-dispatch (2026-05-15)

**Severity:** P1 (crash) · **Domain tag:** ml
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-06-15 — retired by inference** (no direct repro→fix; see rationale). Fix landed in **CLEAN.1.2** (`da26a3a`).

**Root cause / fix.** The original analysis assumed the serial `stemQueue` was `separate()`'s only caller; it was not — the session-prep path drove the **same** `StemSeparator` unlocked (diagnosed as **BUG-031**). CLEAN.1.2 serialized the full input→predict→output critical section under one lock and returns stems by value, so the live + prep paths can no longer drive concurrent MPSGraph work on the shared model buffers — the candidate root cause of this `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`.

**Why retired without a reproduced fix.** BUG-012 was a latent, intermittent crash never deterministically reproduced, so it is retired on convergent evidence rather than a reproduced fix: (1) **CLEAN.1.6 TSan stress** — overlapping live+prep `separate()` on one shared `StemSeparator` + rapid session churn ran **TSan-clean, 0 data races**, directly exercising this crash's race surface; (2) **zero crashes** across Matt's two real validation sessions (`17-22-31Z` local + `17-58-44Z` streaming, 2026-06-14), which include sustained dispatch + prep-during-playback. **If a `StemFFTEngine` `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` recurs, reopen under a new BUG number** — the `BUG012Probe` diagnostic infra (`Sources/Shared/BUG012Probe.swift`) is retained for that. Full diagnosis + instrumentation history is in git (`[BUG-012-i1]`, 2026-05-20) and `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md §BUG-012 instrumentation map`. `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-06-15-d]`.

### BUG-024 — Stale LF artwork bleeds into streaming sessions (LF.6, 2026-06-01)

> **RESOLVED 2026-06-01** — Trivial-collapsed P1 per CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol (< 5 lines, root cause obvious, no architectural risk). Landed as the one-commit `[LF.6.fix.1]` increment.

**Severity:** P1 (visual mis-attribution: the chrome rendered the wrong album's artwork against every streaming track for the entire post-LF session lifetime).

**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`.

**Expected behavior.** When transitioning from an LF session (with embedded artwork) to a streaming session, `engine.currentTrackArtworkData` becomes `nil`. `TrackInfoCardView.showArtworkSlot` evaluates `(albumArtData != nil) || isLocalFileSession` → `false` for streaming + nil → slot hides entirely. The streaming chrome renders text-only — visually identical to pre-LF.6 streaming chrome. (The LF.6 kickoff's Critical Invariants section: *"Streaming-path behaviour is byte-identical to pre-LF.6. `engine.currentTrack` continues to be set by `makeTrackChangeCallback` for streaming, `currentTrackArtworkData` stays `nil` on streaming sessions."*)

**Actual behavior.** `engine.currentTrackArtworkData` retained the previous LF session's bytes indefinitely. The streaming track-change callback at [VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:189-202](PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:189-202) wrote `self.currentTrack = event.current` for every streaming track but never touched `currentTrackArtworkData`. The `@Published` retained the LF bytes. `TrackInfoCardView.showArtworkSlot` evaluated `true` (stale bytes) → rendered the wrong art (e.g. The Cure's Kiss Me cover for every Spotify track).

**Reproduction (Matt's manual smoke, 2026-06-01).**
1. Open `02_cure_m4a.m4a` via Open Local File (LF session with MP4 covr atom artwork).
2. End the LF session.
3. Start a Spotify playlist with multiple tracks (e.g. Radiohead "There, There" + Chaim "Love Rehab").
4. Observe: every streaming track's chrome card shows The Cure's Kiss Me cover in the artwork slot, regardless of the actual track's identity.

**Session artifacts.** Three screenshots from Matt's smoke session: Radiohead track + Chaim track both displaying The Cure's artwork. No session.log captured — visual evidence is the load-bearing artifact.

**Suspected failure class.** `pipeline-wiring`. The LF.6-L2 implementation correctly publishes `currentTrackArtworkData` on every LF state-change site (`handleLocalFileReady` + `advanceLocalFileQueue`) via `applyLocalFileTrackState(...)` but doesn't clear the publisher on the streaming or session-boundary paths. The publisher's last value persists across session and source transitions.

**Verification criteria.**
- *Automated:* extend `PlaybackChromeArtworkBindingTests` with a "LF → streaming transition: artwork-nil emission clears prior LF bytes" case.
- *Manual:* re-run Test 4 from the LF.6 smoke (LF session → end → Spotify playlist). Expected: streaming chrome text-only, no artwork tile, no fallback glyph (slot entirely hidden, card geometry matches pre-LF.6).

**Root cause.** Two LF.6 sites write `currentTrack` (LF: `publishLocalFileTrackSurface`; streaming: `makeTrackChangeCallback`). Only the LF site was paired with a `currentTrackArtworkData` write. The streaming site needs the same pairing (writing `nil` to clear the publisher). Additionally, the `.connecting` state-observer is a natural session-boundary clearing point — adding the clear there is defense-in-depth for ad-hoc / reactive paths that may not fire a track-change callback immediately.

**Fix.**
- `[LF.6.fix.1]` ([VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:190](PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:190)): streaming track-change callback writes `self.currentTrackArtworkData = nil` alongside `self.currentTrack = event.current`, back-to-back in the same MainActor block.
- `[LF.6.fix.1]` ([VisualizerEngine.swift:807](PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine.swift:807)): `.connecting` state observer clears `currentTrackArtworkData = nil` alongside `currentSessionPlanSeed = nil`.
- `[LF.6.fix.1]` ([PlaybackChromeArtworkBindingTests.swift](PhospheneAppTests/PlaybackChromeArtworkBindingTests.swift)): new "LF → streaming transition" regression test (6 tests in suite total).

**Resolved:** 2026-06-01, commit `45021472`.

### BUG-023 — Folder pick race during in-flight prep produces wrong-folder playback + parallel preps + mid-track restart (LF.5, 2026-05-28)

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — Three sub-symptoms (A / B / C) of one upstream concurrency cluster; landed as the three-commit LF.5.fix.3 increment (`0596b8ea` → `ef15d90d` → `1839d3e3`). Multi-increment process per CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol: instrumentation (already on disk from BUG-021's WIRING breadcrumbs) → diagnosis → fix B → fix A → fix C.

**Severity:** P1 (audible mis-playback: folder A's analysis drove playback against folder B's URL queue; active playback torn down mid-track without user input).
**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring` (cross-layer state-machine race).
**Failure class:** `concurrency` (cancel-then-restart race + supersession-flag clobber + duplicate consumer fire).
**Introduced:** LF.5 (`e9443e9f`, 2026-05-28) — the `startLocalFiles(at:origin:)` API. LF.4's single-file path had the same concurrency primitives but the user-flow never reached the "two picks in flight" state.

### Expected behavior

1. Picking a new folder while a previous folder's prep is still running cancels the previous prep silently. No transition to `.ready`, no playback start, no torn-down player.
2. The new folder's prep runs exactly once (no parallel runs that race on the persistent stem cache).
3. If a duplicate `.ready` emission somehow reaches `handleLocalFileReady` for the URL we're already playing, the consumer no-ops instead of tearing down and restarting from frame 0.

### Actual behavior

In session `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28T20-57-46Z/session.log`:

- **A — Cancelled prep transitioned to .ready.** Line 14 logs `prepareLocalFiles DONE cached=2 failed=0 total=200` (folder A cancelled 2/200 in). Line 19 logs `SessionManager.startLocalFiles→ready count=2`. Line 15-20 then fires `handleLocalFileReady` for folder A's first track ("Can't Leave the Night") against folder B's URL queue (already in `currentSource` from B's `_beginMultiFileTransition`).
- **B — Two parallel preps of folder B.** Lines 43-49 and 52-66 show two interleaved runs of folder B's 5-file queue. Run X started at 20:59:34, Run Y at 21:00:22 (~48 s gap). Files 1-3 of Run Y hit `persistentDisk` because Run X had written them; files 1, 4, 5 raced on fresh analysis. Two `prepareLocalFiles DONE cached=5` events (21:01:48 + 21:02:14) and two `_completeLocalFilesReady` calls (21:01:49 + 21:02:14) followed.
- **C — Mid-track restart.** Line 78-94 (21:02:14): SZ2 was playing (started 21:01:49). The second `_completeLocalFilesReady` fired, transitioned `.playing → .ready`, the state observer re-ran `handleLocalFileReady`, ran `provider.teardown` (lines 83-92), and restarted audio router with mode `.localFilePlayback(SZ2)` from frame 0. No user input prompted the restart.

### Reproduction steps

1. Launch app.
2. `File → Open Local Folder`, pick a large folder (50+ tracks). Preparation begins (sequential per-file).
3. Within ~10-30 s (BEFORE the first folder's prep completes), click `File → Open Local Folder` again and pick a different, smaller folder (5 tracks).
4. (Captured session also included a Stop between picks — that's what kicked state into `.ended` and bypassed `cancel()`. Symptoms B + C reproduce without the Stop on the simpler reproducer too; the Stop just makes the parallel-prep window wider.)

### Session artifacts

- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28T20-57-46Z/session.log` lines 3-94 (the WIRING breadcrumbs from BUG-006.1 + LF.5.fix.2-FU1/FU3 are sufficient — no new instrumentation needed for diagnosis).

### Root cause

Three contributing factors at different layers:

1. **`_beginMultiFileTransition` resets `cancellationRequested = false`** ([SessionManager.swift:423](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionManager.swift)). The older `startLocalFiles(A)` was suspended on `await preparer.prepareLocalFiles`. When B's `startLocalFiles` runs `cancel()` then `_beginMultiFileTransition(B)`, the flag toggles `true → false` between A's suspension and A's resume. The post-await guard `if cancellationRequested` evaluated `false` for A, so A proceeded into `_completeLocalFilesReady` with its cancelled-prep partial result.

2. **`cancel()` is guarded on `state != .idle && state != .ended`** ([SessionManager.swift:383](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionManager.swift)). When the user pressed Stop between the two folder picks, state transitioned to `.ended`. The second `startLocalFiles(B)` saw `state == .ended`, skipped `cancel()`, and never told the preparer to cancel the first folder B's still-running prep task — so two `prepareLocalFiles` ran in parallel.

3. **`preparationTask = nil` at end of every `prepareLocalFiles` return** ([SessionPreparer.swift:269](PhospheneEngine/Sources/Session/SessionPreparer.swift)). An older call resolving out-of-order would clobber a newer task's reference, making the newer task untrackable for any subsequent cancellation.

Symptom A is direct from (1). Symptom B is direct from (2) + (3). Symptom C is the consumer-side fallout of two `_completeLocalFilesReady` calls reaching the `state` observer for the same session.

### Fix

Three commits within LF.5.fix.3:

- **`[LF.5.fix.3-B]` SessionPreparer: cancel previous prep at API boundary** (`0596b8ea`). `prepareLocalFiles` and `prepare(tracks:)` prefix the body with `preparationTask?.cancel()` (catches the `.ended`-bypass leftover). Removed the `preparationTask = nil` at exit (so an older call resolving out-of-order can't drop the newer task's reference). `cancelPreparation()` now nils the field explicitly. **Note:** The `prepare(tracks:)` change was reverted during testing (the `preparationTask = nil` exit was load-bearing for the streaming `replacesActiveStreamingSession` tests); only `prepareLocalFiles` carries the new pattern. LF-specific scope.

- **`[LF.5.fix.3-A]` SessionManager: gen-counter gate on .ready transition** (`ef15d90d`). New `localFileSessionGen: UInt64` field, monotonic. `startLocalFiles` increments + captures `myGen` before `_beginMultiFileTransition`; the post-await guard bails when `localFileSessionGen != myGen`. Replaces the broken `cancellationRequested` post-await check (kept as a secondary check for explicit `cancel()` calls).

- **`[LF.5.fix.3-C]` VisualizerEngine: handleLocalFileReady URL idempotency** (`1839d3e3`). New `lastStartedLocalFilePlaybackURL: URL?` field on `VisualizerEngine`. The guard at the start of `handleLocalFileReady` checks if the new `source.localFileURL` matches the marker and no-ops if so. The marker commits on successful `audioRouter.start` and clears on `.preparing` (new session) + `.ended` (teardown) in the state observer. Defense-in-depth per Matt's kickoff decision (URL match only).

### Verification

- **Automated.**
  - `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine --filter "startLocalFiles_supersededCall_doesNotTransitionToReady|startLocalFiles_secondCall_cancelsFirstInFlight_evenAfterEndSession"` — both new tests pass. Engine suite 1359/1359 (1 known MemoryReporter flake unrelated).
  - `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test` — 160 app tests pass including the new `HandleLocalFileReadyIdempotencyRegression` suite (3 source-presence assertions).
  - Bug A test uses `Task.detached`-wrapped stub delegate to mirror production's uninterruptible per-file work and deterministically sequence A's resume AFTER B's `.ready` transition — that's the sequencing trick that lets the assertion discriminate.
- **Manual.** Reproducer above. Expected post-fix:
  - Picking the second folder cancels the first prep silently (no `.ready` transition for folder A, no playback of folder A's tracks).
  - Folder B preps exactly once (no duplicate `prepareLocalFile #N of 5` events in the new session.log).
  - Folder B transitions to `.ready` exactly once. If the user re-picks the same folder, the same-origin re-entry guard already short-circuits upstream of the new gen + URL idempotency layers.

### Out of scope

- LF.5.fix.2-FU2 stem-pipeline cancellation (already shipped + validated in the same captured session log).
- The cousin-bug `mir.elapsedSeconds` reset at LF playback start (already shipped as LF.5.fix.2-FU4 / FU-5).
- Recents persistence / file-association.
- Multi-file drag-and-drop semantics.
- The streaming-path `prepare(tracks:)` has the same nil-at-exit race in theory; out of scope for this LF-focused increment. File separately if observed.

### Resolved

`0596b8ea` (Bug B fix), `ef15d90d` (Bug A fix), `1839d3e3` (Bug C fix). 2026-05-28.

### BUG-022 — Session video.mp4 unreadable after force-quit / crash (missing moov atom) (2026-05-28)

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — Trivial P2; collapsed diagnose-and-fix into a single increment per `CLAUDE.md §Defect Handling Protocol`.

**Severity:** P2 (no functional defect in playback or analysis; only post-hoc diagnostic evidence — `ffmpeg signalstats`, frame extraction, AVURLAsset reads — is broken).
**Domain tag:** `resource-management`.
**Failure class:** `resource-management` (writer index never written when teardown doesn't reach `finishWriting`).
**Introduced:** Original `SessionRecorder` design; surfaced now because BUG-021 (force-quit reproducer) made the failure visible at high frequency.

### Expected behavior

Every session directory's `video.mp4` is readable by ffprobe / ffmpeg / QuickTime — independent of how the session ended (clean Cmd+Q, "End session" button, force-quit, crash, signal kill). The M7 evidence pipeline (`ffmpeg signalstats` brightness oscillation counts, frame extraction for visual review) works against every session video.

### Actual behavior

`AVAssetWriter` writes mdat (sample data) progressively but only writes moov (the index) when `finishWriting(completionHandler:)` runs. `SessionRecorder.finish()` is reachable from two call sites: `deinit` (never fires when the process is killed by signal) and `NSApplication.willTerminateNotification` (fires only on clean Cmd+Q-style termination). Force-quit, `kill -9`, and crashes all skip `finish()`, so the resulting `video.mp4` is mdat-only and cannot be parsed by any standard tool: `ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration ...` returns `moov atom not found ... Invalid data found when processing input`.

### Reproduction steps

1. Launch Phosphene; let it record some frames.
2. Force-quit the app (Activity Monitor → Force Quit, or `kill -9 $(pgrep PhospheneApp)`).
3. `ffprobe ~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<latest>/video.mp4` → `moov atom not found`.

### Session artifacts

Across `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28*`:
- 3 sessions (`18-31-06Z`, `18-59-47Z`, `19-21-18Z`) ended cleanly — all 3 have `SessionRecorder finished` in `session.log` AND a valid moov.
- 5 sessions (`17-44-10Z`, `17-50-42Z`, `19-04-51Z`, `19-26-13Z`, `19-35-13Z`) ended abnormally (BUG-021 force-quits or earlier hangs) — none have the finish-marker AND none have a moov. Perfect 1-to-1 correlation.
- The named reproducer in the BUG-022 prompt (`2026-05-28T19-04-51Z`) is the BUG-021 force-quit session; the moov-missing state is a downstream effect of the unrelated freeze-and-force-quit, not a bug in the session itself.

### Root cause

`SessionRecorder+Video.swift:setupVideoWriter` initialized the `AVAssetWriter` with no `movieFragmentInterval`, so the writer accumulated all sample tables in memory and intended to write them in a single moov at the end of writing. When the process terminates without `finishWriting`, the writer's intended final moov is never written. The on-disk file ends with the last appended mdat.

This is a single-cause defect with no architectural risk:
- The recorder is app-lifetime, not session-lifetime — `SessionManager.endSession()` correctly does not call `finish()`.
- The clean Cmd+Q path is already wired (`VisualizerEngine+InitHelpers.swift:149-157`).
- The bug is purely "what does the on-disk file look like before `finish()` is called?"

### Fix

`SessionRecorder+Video.swift:setupVideoWriter` now sets `writer.movieFragmentInterval = CMTime(seconds: 5, preferredTimescale: 1)` immediately after `AVAssetWriter` init. With this property non-zero, AVAssetWriter writes:

1. An initial `moov` atom with metadata (no sample tables) immediately at `startWriting()` time.
2. `mdat` boxes for media data, as before.
3. A `moof` (movie fragment) box every 5 s, indexing the preceding mdat data.

Up to the last fragment boundary is always recoverable. Clean Cmd+Q still calls `finishWriting` via the `willTerminate` observer and produces a final moov as before (the file is fragmented MP4 either way — still fully readable by ffprobe / ffmpeg / QuickTime / AVURLAsset).

Worst-case data loss on abnormal termination: up to the most recent 5 s of recorded video (≤ 2.5 MB at the 4 Mbps target bitrate, 30 fps cap).

### Verification

- Engine test suite filtered to `SessionRecorderTests` (19 tests) passes after the change — the existing `test_recordFrame_withCaptureTexture_producesReadableVideo` still validates the clean-finish path.
- Manual matrix (post-fix): launch a session, write ≥ 10 s of frames, then test each termination path:
  - Cmd+Q → `ffprobe` reads duration ✓ (already worked pre-fix; regression check)
  - `kill -9` → `ffprobe` reads duration ✓ (was broken pre-fix; the fix's contract)
  - "End session" button + Cmd+Q → `ffprobe` reads duration ✓
  - Real session under app workload (BUG-021-style flow) → next captured session validates this in practice.
- Resulting MP4s remain compatible with the M7 evidence pipeline (`ffmpeg signalstats`, frame extraction) per the AVAssetWriter fragmented-MP4 contract.

### Out of scope

- **Recovering existing damaged files.** The 5 affected sessions on Matt's disk (`2026-05-28T17-44-10Z`, `17-50-42Z`, `19-04-51Z`, `19-26-13Z`, `19-35-13Z`) remain unrecoverable without an external tool like `untrunc`/`mp4recover`. Per the BUG-022 prompt, retroactive recovery is explicitly out of scope. Their `features.csv` / `session.log` / `stems.csv` / `raw_tap.wav` remain intact.
- **Calling `finish()` from `SessionManager.endSession()`.** The recorder is app-lifetime, not session-lifetime. Forcing finalization on session-end would require restarting the writer for the next session, with no benefit (the running file is already crash-recoverable via the fragment interval).
- **Changing codec, bitrate, or video resolution.** Per BUG-022 prompt scope.

### Resolved

Commit pending Matt's sign-off. (Working tree was originally dirty with an unrelated BUG-020.fix edit; that has since been committed as `e9443e9f`, so the BUG-022 change is now in a clean-commit state — three files: `SessionRecorder+Video.swift`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`.)

### BUG-021 — Next button froze the app + orchestrator cycled every preset alphabetically (LF.5, 2026-05-28)

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — root cause identified via two-stage diagnostic; structural fix landed.
>
> **Round-1 diagnostic** (`2ab70ced`) localized the hang to `audioRouter.stop()`. **Round-2** (`8d8576f2`) instrumented every sub-step inside `LocalFilePlaybackProvider._stopLocked`. Session `2026-05-28T19-35-13Z` ended at `provider._stopLocked player.stop BEGIN` — `AVAudioPlayerNode.stop()` was the blocking call.
>
> **Root cause:** ABBA deadlock between the provider's NSLock and AVFoundation's render thread. `stop()` was wrapped in `lock.withLock { _stopLocked() }`. Inside, `player.stop()` blocks waiting for the render thread to drain. The render thread was running a `scheduleFile` completion callback that itself acquires the same lock to check whether the captured player is still active. NSLock is non-recursive — MainActor held the lock → callback blocked on it → `player.stop()` waited for callback → MainActor waited forever.
>
> **Fix:** snapshot AVFoundation refs + nil-out the fields under the lock, release the lock, then call `player.stop()` / `removeTap` / `engine.stop()` outside the lock. When the completion callback runs during teardown, its `playerNode === player` check fails (we nil-ed it under the lock already) and the callback bails out without recursing. New `teardownAVFoundation(refs:diagnostic:)` static helper holds the post-lock teardown sequence. `start()` calls `stop()` before acquiring the lock so the previous-instance teardown also runs lock-free.
>
> **Companion problem also resolved.** The GAP D revert (round-1 commit) was the right call for the orchestrator cycling. Session 2026-05-28T19-35-13Z shows `mode=reactive, planIdx=0` and no alphabetical-cycle bug.

**Severity:** P1 (UX-blocker — required force-quit). Resolved.
**Domain tag:** `concurrency` + `pipeline-wiring`.
**Session:** `2026-05-28T19-04-51Z`. 2-track folder ([2014] - Can't Leave the Night - Sustain).

### Expected behavior

Pressing Next on the transport bar advances to the next track within ~50 ms (LF.4 baseline). Session log shows `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL caller=trackChange` for the new track + `raw tap capture started` shortly after. Orchestrator in planned mode follows the planner's per-track segment assignments — typically 2-4 preset transitions per track.

### Actual behavior

1. **Freeze on Next button press.** Beachball; force-quit required. Last log entry: `stem separation 22` then nothing. No advance breadcrumbs.
2. **Orchestrator cycling through every preset alphabetically.** ~25 preset transitions in 2 minutes, one every ~5 s, following alphabetical order: Waveform → Arachne → Aurora Veil → Ferrofluid Ocean → Fractal Tree → Glass Brutalist → Gossamer → Kinetic Sculpture → Lumen Mosaic → Membrane → Murmuration → Nebula → Plasma → Spectral Cartograph → Staged Sandbox → Volumetric Lithograph → loop. Not the planner's variety output; a systematic walk through the catalog.

### Reproduction steps

1. macOS 26.4.1, Phosphene HEAD with D-LF5-4 buildPlan() call present in handleLocalFileReady.
2. File → Open Local Folder → pick a 2+ track folder.
3. Let it play for ~90 s. Observe preset transitions every ~5 s in alphabetical order.
4. Press Next on the transport bar.
5. Beachball; app unresponsive. Force-quit.

### Session artifacts

- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28T19-04-51Z/session.log` — shows the preset cycling AND the abrupt log end at 19:08:36 with no advance breadcrumbs (matches MainActor hang).
- Orchestrator wire line: `mode=session, planIdx=0, elapsedTrackTime=105.4s` — planned mode engaged (per D-LF5-1 + D-LF5-4 wire) but elapsedTrackTime 105.4 s after 3 s of playback is suspicious.

### Suspected failure class

Hypothesized chain (not yet verified):
1. D-LF5-4's buildPlan() call produces a pathological plan when the certified catalog has only 2 presets (FerrofluidOcean + LumenMosaic) — the plan-walker resorts to walking the full catalog alphabetically when scoring ties are common.
2. Each preset transition runs `applyPreset` on MainActor (GPU pipeline rebuild). Cumulative load is significant.
3. When user presses Next, `advanceLocalFileQueue` runs on MainActor. If the orchestrator's plan-walker enters a tight loop after the `liveTrackPlanIndex = nextIdx` write, MainActor never gets back to finishing the advance. Hang.

### Mitigation landed (this commit)

- **Revert D-LF5-4's buildPlan() call** in `handleLocalFileReady`. LF sessions return to the pre-D-LF5-4 reactive-orchestrator behaviour: no multi-preset variety per song, but no cycling-through-alphabet bug either. The D-LF5-1 `liveTrackPlanIndex` write stays — the orchestrator just won't have a livePlannedSession to consult.
- **Diagnostic** added to `advanceLocalFileQueue`: synchronous `sessionRecorder?.log("WIRING: advanceLocalFileQueue …")` lines at each step (ENTER / audioRouter.stop BEGIN/COMPLETE / resetStemPipeline COMPLETE / orchestratorLock COMPLETE / audioRouter.start BEGIN/COMPLETE / EXIT). If the freeze recurs after this commit, the last logged step identifies the hanging call.

### Verification criteria

- 5 successive Next presses on a 3-track folder complete in < 200 ms each.
- session.log shows 3 `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL caller=trackChange` lines + 3 `raw tap capture started` lines.
- Preset transitions ≤ 3 per minute on average (reactive scheduler's normal cadence).
- WIRING breadcrumbs for advanceLocalFileQueue land at all steps without any gap > 200 ms between consecutive steps.

### Outstanding work

- Diagnose **why** the planner's alphabetical-cycle behaviour kicks in. Read `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift`'s plan-walker; investigate scoring-tie resolution; check whether the segment duration math collapses with only 2 certified presets. **Still open.**
- Re-enable buildPlan() for LF when the certified catalog reaches ≥ 5 presets AND the plan-walker is verified safe under short-segment plans. **Still open** (deferred pending catalog growth).
- ~~Identify the precise MainActor hang point from the next session capture's WIRING breadcrumbs.~~ Resolved in `53986fac` (lock-free AVFoundation teardown).
- ~~Stem-separation-after-stop CPU work~~ — verification session `2026-05-28T19-42-50Z` exposed ~12 stem separations / ~60-120 s of CPU work after Stop. Resolved by LF.5.fix.2-FU2 (stem timer cancelled in `.ended` state observer).
- ~~`elapsedTrackTime` session-monotonic across LF track changes~~ — verification session `2026-05-28T19-42-50Z` showed the orchestrator wire-active log line's `elapsedTrackTime=` growing 10.9 s → 23.0 s → 35.1 s across Next/Prev presses. Same root cause silently wrong-shaped `fv.trackElapsedS` (FFO cold-start), `featureStability` ramp-up, and recording `playbackTime` for the LF advance path. Resolved by LF.5.fix.2-FU3 (LF advance fires `mir.reset()` + `pipeline.resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` to mirror the streaming track-change callback).
- ~~`elapsedTrackTime` carries session-prep accumulation into LF playback start~~ — session `2026-05-28T20-36-17Z` showed the first `Orchestrator: wire active` line emitting `elapsedTrackTime=440.1s` after 3 s of actual playback. **Two-mover root cause**, mis-diagnosed at FU-4:
  - First mover (FU-4, commit `9f83c471`): `MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` is `+= deltaTime`-d every frame and not reset on LF startup. FU-4 added `mirPipeline.reset()` + `pipeline.resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` immediately before `audioRouter.start(mode:.localFilePlayback(url))` in `handleLocalFileReady`, mirroring FU-3's placement.
  - Second mover (FU-5, this commit): `VisualizerEngine.lastAnalysisTime` is initialized at `setupAudioRouting` time (engine init, [VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:28](PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:28)) and only updated inside `processAnalysisFrame`. With a 91 s prep window before the first audio frame, `dt = now - lastAnalysisTime ≈ 91 s` on that first frame, and that huge `dt` flows into `mir.process(deltaTime:)` at [MIRPipeline.swift:235](PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift:235) — re-adding the prep gap on a SINGLE frame, immediately after FU-4's `mirPipeline.reset()` zeroed it. Verification session `2026-05-28T21-08-33Z` showed `elapsedTrackTime=94.3s` (91 s prep gap + 3 s real playback) — FU-4 alone was insufficient. FU-5 closes the second mover by setting `lastAnalysisTime = CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()` at the same instant. FU-3 (advance) didn't expose this because audio was flowing right up to `audioRouter.stop()`, so `lastAnalysisTime` was already recent.
- ~~Noisy no-op `provider.teardown ENTER`/`EXIT` breadcrumbs at every session start + advance~~. Resolved by LF.5.fix.2-FU1 (`LocalFilePlaybackProvider.stop()` skips the teardown helper when the lock-protected snapshot is all-nil).

### BUG-016 — Lumen Mosaic "not working" in 2026-05-21 reactive-mode sessions

**Severity:** P2 (visible degradation on one production preset; not session-blocking — Matt cycled past it in both 2026-05-21 sessions and the remaining catalog rendered correctly).
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-26.** Matt characterised the symptom: "black-and-white panel, no color, no motion." Code review root-caused as Candidate 1 variant (LM.4.7 zeroed-palette path, but with `LumenPatternEngine` init succeeding — not the `device.makeBuffer` failure mode CA-Presets-FU-4 was instrumented for). Fix: load the per-song palette at preset-activate, not just on track-change. Trivial-collapse increment (Matt's explicit approval, 2026-05-26). Commit pending.
**Introduced:** 2026-05-18 (LM.4.7, commit `6eef536c`). Pre-LM.4.7 the cell colour was procedural (no payload required); LM.4.7 made the shader's `lm_cell_palette` lookup depend on `lumen.palette[0..11]` populated via `setPalette(_:)`. The orchestrator-side hook (`refreshLumenPaletteForTrack` in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) was wired to fire from `resetStemPipeline` — which only fires on track change. Switching to Lumen Mosaic via `Shift+→` mid-track left the engine at its zero-initialised default palette until the next track-change event.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-26 — `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` LM branch now calls `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack` immediately after `LumenPatternEngine` instantiation, gated on the most-recently-resolved `TrackIdentity` (new property `lastResolvedTrackIdentity` on `VisualizerEngine`, set by the track-change handler in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift`). Commit pending.

---

### Expected behavior

Lumen Mosaic renders a 4-light pattern engine driving a cell-mosaic surface with per-beat cell-colour dance per the CLAUDE.md "Visual Quality Floor / Authoring Discipline" notes (preset has strong drums + vocals stem affinity; cell-depth gradient via albedo per the Failed Approach #23 scope clarification; pale-tone-share ≤ 0.30 per LM.9). Selecting Lumen Mosaic via `Shift+→` in either reactive or session-mode playback should produce the certified visual.

### Actual behavior

Matt's report: "Lumen Mosaic was not working." Symptom not characterized further. Candidate failure modes the investigation should distinguish on the next reproduction:

1. **Black or blank screen.** Suggests a Metal pipeline state failure — empty draw, missing texture binding, or shader compilation error caught only at runtime. Look in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` and the unified log for Metal errors near the preset switch.
2. **Stuck on a previous preset's image.** Suggests the preset apply path failed silently — `applyPreset` returned without binding the new pipeline state. Look in `session.log` for the `preset → Lumen Mosaic` line followed by zero subsequent rendering activity.
3. **Visual artifacts (corrupted geometry, garbled colours, frame-rate stutter).** Suggests a shader or buffer-binding bug. Check fragment-slot bindings, particularly slot 8 (LM.2 / D-LM-buffer-slot-8 — the 336-byte `LumenPatternEngine` UMA buffer).
4. **No audio response.** Suggests the per-frame tick or stem-affinity routing is broken. The preset's audio coupling lives in `LumenPatternEngine` (App layer) flushing state to slot 8.
5. **Pale-dominant ground (LM.9 regression).** Aggregate pale-cell share > 0.30 — would mean LM.9's cert gate isn't enforcing post-LM.4.7. Visually the panel reads as cream-dominated rather than vivid.

The prior 2026-05-21T13-58-07Z session.log shows Lumen Mosaic was active for ~11 s (lines 36–38 of that capture: `[13:59:22Z] preset → Lumen Mosaic` → `[13:59:33Z] preset → Membrane`) with no error/warning lines emitted in that window — consistent with "rendered something, but not what was expected" rather than "crashed or produced no frames."

### Reproduction steps

1. Build and launch the app: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` then run from Xcode or `open` the built bundle.
2. Grant screen-capture permission if prompted.
3. Start music playback (Spotify, Apple Music, or any system audio source).
4. Cycle to Lumen Mosaic via `Shift+→` (8 presses from the default Waveform per the 2026-05-21 capture order: Arachne → Aurora Veil → Ferrofluid Ocean → Fractal Tree → Glass Brutalist → Gossamer → Kinetic Sculpture → Lumen Mosaic).
5. Observe: characterize the symptom against the 5 candidates above. Capture a screenshot or short video.
6. End the session normally so `session.log`, `features.csv`, `stems.csv`, `video.mp4` are all written.

**Minimum reproducer:** any music source, any track. Lumen Mosaic's failure is preset-level and should reproduce regardless of audio content. The "any track" claim needs verification — the 2026-05-21T13-58-07Z capture was Led Zeppelin "Black Dog"; whether the symptom is track-correlated or universal is part of the open diagnosis.

---

### Session artifacts

**Session directory:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-21T13-58-07Z/` (Lumen Mosaic was active from 13:59:22Z to 13:59:33Z — ~11 s of frames are buried in `video.mp4` at that timestamp range).

Additional artifacts needed on next reproduction:

- A still screenshot of the broken state (most diagnostic; the existing video has the frames but a fresh screenshot at known wall-clock is faster).
- `session.log` from a session where the user holds on Lumen Mosaic for ≥ 30 s rather than cycling past in 11 s.
- The unified-log Metal-related lines around the preset switch:
  ```
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.phosphene" OR subsystem CONTAINS "Metal"' --info --last 5m
  ```

```log
[2026-05-21T13:59:22Z] preset → Lumen Mosaic     ← switch happened
[2026-05-21T13:59:26Z] stem separation 10 ...    ← +4s, stem pipeline still firing
[2026-05-21T13:59:31Z] stem separation 11 ...    ← +9s, no errors
[2026-05-21T13:59:33Z] preset → Membrane         ← Matt cycled away
```

No error or warning lines in the 11-second Lumen Mosaic window.

---

### Suspected failure class

`pipeline-wiring` OR `render-state` OR `regression` — cannot narrow without symptom characterization. The session.log silence rules out a crash; rules in: silent shader failure, wrong buffer binding, palette-library regression from LM.4.7, or a recent unintentional change to the LumenPatternEngine tick.

**Evidence for this class:** the failure is preset-specific (other presets in the cycle rendered correctly per the same session.log), Metal pipeline state binding is per-preset, and Lumen Mosaic's slot-8 fragment buffer dispatch is unique in the catalog.

---

### Verification criteria

When this defect is resolved, the following must all pass:

- [ ] Matt confirms Lumen Mosaic renders correctly in a reactive-mode session ≥ 30 s of held-on time.
- [ ] Visual matches the LM.7 reference frames in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/LumenMosaic/` (if a curated reference set exists — needs verification during the diagnosis).
- [ ] Pale-tone-share ≤ 0.30 maintained per LM.9.
- [ ] `PresetVisualReviewTests` or equivalent harness still produces a recognizable Lumen Mosaic render (if such a harness exists for this preset; if not, that's a separate gap to file).

**Manual validation required:** Yes — preset.fidelity per CLAUDE.md's Defect Handling Protocol. Automated golden-hash regression is insufficient; Matt's M7-style review is the load-bearing check.

---

### Fix scope

Unknown until symptom is characterized. Candidate scopes by failure class:

- *Pipeline wiring:* small (≤ 20 LOC) — buffer binding, slot ordering, or tick closure registration in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (`applyPreset .lumenMosaic:` branch).
- *Shader / render-state:* medium — `LumenMosaic.metal` regression, possibly tied to a recent shader-library change.
- *Palette-library regression (LM.4.7):* small-to-medium — depends on which palette and which mood-mapping broke.

Filed before the diagnosis per CLAUDE.md "evidence-before-implementation" so future-Matt + future-Claude know this is open and unresolved rather than buried in chat.

### Related

CLAUDE.md §Visual Quality Floor (pale-tone-share rule per D-LM-cream-rescission); `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.1` (Lumen Mosaic cert gates); D-LM-buffer-slot-8 (slot 8 fragment-buffer reservation); D-LM-palette-library (LM.4.7 curated palettes); D-LM-cream-rescission (the rescinded categorical anti-cream rule). BUG-014 (Resolved via LM.4.7 — verify no orchestrator-side scoring path encodes the pre-LM.4.7 palette assumption; this BUG-016 is a separate observed failure post-LM.4.7).

---

### Addendum (CA-Presets, 2026-05-21)

The Presets-Swift capability audit ([`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md`](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md)) read `LumenPatternEngine.swift` + `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` end-to-end and characterised one Swift-side candidate root cause for the symptom:

**LumenPatternEngine.init? silently fails on `device.makeBuffer` failure.** At `LumenPatternEngine.swift:580-585`:

```swift
public init?(device: MTLDevice, seed: UInt64 = 0) {
    let bufSize = MemoryLayout<LumenPatternState>.stride  // 568 bytes
    guard let buf = device.makeBuffer(length: bufSize, options: .storageModeShared) else {
        return nil   // ← silent — no os.Logger, no sessionRecorder
    }
    ...
}
```

The init returns nil with **no logging from the Presets-module-internal side**. The App-side construction at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:423-433` catches the nil and logs via `logger.error(...)` to category `"com.phosphene.app"` — but that line does NOT reach `session.log` (which is the engine-module `Logging.session` channel).

**Mapping CA-Presets findings to the 5 candidate failure modes above:**

| Candidate | CA-Presets verdict |
|---|---|
| 1. Black/blank screen | **PLAUSIBLE.** If `device.makeBuffer(568 bytes, .storageModeShared)` fails (memory pressure, GPU-device disconnect, etc.), `lumenPatternEngine` stays nil → App-side falls through without binding slot 8 → `LumenMosaic.metal` reads zeroed `LumenPatternState` → renders against the LM.4.7 zeroed-palette path. **Verifiable on next reproduction:** check session.log for an `os.Logger.error("LumenPatternState: failed to allocate state")` line near the preset switch (it would be in the unified log via `log show --predicate 'subsystem CONTAINS "com.phosphene"'`, but NOT in session.log without the FU-4 instrumentation fix). |
| 2. Stuck on previous preset | Out of Presets-Swift scope (App-layer `applyPreset` switch logic). |
| 3. Visual artifacts | Out of Presets-Swift scope (`LumenMosaic.metal` shader). |
| 4. No audio response | **PLAUSIBLE.** `LumenPatternEngine._tick` updates band counters only on `f.beatPhase01` wraps (from > 0.85 to < 0.15). **No FFT fallback** (documented at `LumenPatternEngine.swift:895-898` as a known LM.4.3 limitation). If `f.beatPhase01` stays at 0 (reactive mode pre-grid, or silence), no counters advance and the panel reads static. **Verifiable on next reproduction:** check features.csv for `beat_phase01` values across the affected window. If identically 0 → Mode 4 confirmed → known reactive-mode limitation. |
| 5. Pale-dominant LM.9 regression | Verifiable via offline color analysis of `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.all` 18 palettes against the ≤ 0.30 pale-share gate. **Note:** the pale-share ceiling is NOT enforced as a FidelityRubric automated item — it is M7-manual-only. |

**Recommended diagnostic upgrade (filed as CA-Presets-FU-4):** add `Logging.session?.log("LumenPatternEngine init failed: device.makeBuffer returned nil for \(bufSize) bytes")` to the App-side construction failure branch at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:433` (additive — keep the `logger.error` line). Closes the silent-init-failure diagnosis gap for the next reproduction.

**No code changes landed in this addendum** — the audit is read-only; fixes wait for Matt's reproduction + scope authorisation.

---

### Addendum (CA-Presets-FU-4 instrumentation landed, 2026-05-21)

The diagnostic upgrade recommended above shipped as CA-Presets-FU-4 (commit `cb8cb0bb`). Two corrections to the previous addendum's recipe were applied:

1. **Channel routing.** The previous addendum proposed `Logging.session?.log(...)` for the App-side site. That is structurally wrong: `Logging.session` is an `os.Logger` (not Optional, not a `SessionRecorder`), so it does NOT write to the on-disk `session.log` file. The on-disk file is owned by `SessionRecorder.log(_:)`. The shipped instrumentation covers BOTH channels:
   - **App-side** (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:172-186`): `sessionRecorder?.log(...)` writes to the on-disk `session.log` file (greppable without `log show` invocation).
   - **Engine-internal** (`LumenPatternEngine.swift:583-595`): `Logging.session.error(...)` writes to the unified log under category `"session"` (captures even from App-side caller variants that don't have `SessionRecorder` in scope).

2. **Site line numbers.** The previous addendum cited `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:423-433` as the App-side LumenMosaic construction site. Those lines belong to the AuroraVeil branch. The actual LumenMosaic site is at lines 165-187 (the `if desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"` block inside `applyPreset .rayMarch`).

**Retrieval predicates for the next reproduction:**

```bash
# On-disk session.log (App-side SessionRecorder write)
grep "LumenPatternEngine: failed to allocate slot-8 buffer" \
  ~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<ts>/session.log

# Unified log (engine-internal Logging.session.error write)
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.phosphene" AND category == "session"' \
  --info --last 30m | grep "LumenPatternEngine init failed"
```

**BUG-016 stays Open.** Instrumentation is not a fix. The next reproduction should:
1. Reproduce the failure (Lumen Mosaic visible degradation in a reactive-mode session).
2. Check both predicates above. If either fires, Candidate 1 (Black/blank screen via silent `device.makeBuffer` nil) is confirmed and the fix scope is "make `LumenPatternState` allocation more robust" or "investigate why `.storageModeShared` is failing at 568 bytes on Matt's hardware."
3. If neither predicate fires, the failure is one of the other 4 candidate modes (stuck-on-previous, visual artifacts, no-audio-response, or pale-dominant LM.9 regression) — proceed with the per-candidate diagnosis path.

---

### Addendum (Resolution, 2026-05-26)

Matt characterised the symptom on 2026-05-26: "black-and-white panel, no color, no motion." Code review traced this to a Candidate-1 *variant* — the LM.4.7 zeroed-palette path *with `LumenPatternEngine` init succeeding* — distinct from the silent `device.makeBuffer` failure mode the CA-Presets-FU-4 instrumentation was looking for.

**Concrete failure path.**

1. User starts a session; a track is playing; some other preset is active.
2. `resetStemPipeline → refreshLumenPaletteForTrack` runs at track-change, but is no-op because `lumenPatternEngine == nil` (LM isn't yet the active preset).
3. User cycles to Lumen Mosaic via `Shift+→`. `applyPreset .rayMarch` branch instantiates `LumenPatternEngine(device:)` — init succeeds, no `device.makeBuffer` failure. The palette is the all-zero default from the `LumenPatternState` initializer (`LumenPatternEngine.swift:305-312`).
4. `setPalette(_:)` has no call site between LM activation and the next track change. The palette stays all-zero until that next track-change fires `resetStemPipeline`.
5. The shader's `lm_cell_palette` lookup (`LumenMosaic.metal:539-578`) returns `(0,0,0)` for every cell. The cell-boundary frost halo (`LumenMosaic.metal:775-779`) mixes `cell_hue (=0)` toward `float3(1.0f)` at boundaries. Visual reading: a black Voronoi grid with white frost halos at cell edges — Matt's "black-and-white panel."
6. Motion is internally present (`bassCounter`/`midCounter`/`trebleCounter` advance on each beat; `lm_cell_palette`'s palette index walks deterministically), but every palette slot resolves to the same colour (black), so the visual reading is "no motion."

**Why the CA-Presets-FU-4 instrumentation didn't fire.** That instrumentation guards the `init? returns nil` path. The actual failure path has init returning a valid engine — only the palette payload is the zero default. No log line is produced because nothing is wrong from the engine's POV; the failure is the *absence* of a `setPalette` call from the app-side activation path.

**Fix landed (2026-05-26).**

- New `var lastResolvedTrackIdentity: TrackIdentity?` on `VisualizerEngine` (`VisualizerEngine.swift`), set by the track-change handler in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift` after `canonicalTrackIdentity(matching:)` resolves the identity. Internal-only (not `@Published`); view models continue to bind to `currentTrack` / `currentTrackIndex`.
- `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack(identity:lumenEngine:)` in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` promoted from `private` to `internal` (default) so `applyPreset` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` can call it.
- `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` LM branch (lines 163-186) now calls `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack` immediately after `LumenPatternEngine` instantiation, gated on `lastResolvedTrackIdentity`. When the user activates LM mid-track, the palette is populated from the same library + mood-bias path that runs at track-change.

**Regression coverage.** New `LumenPalettePayloadTests` suite (`PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Presets/LumenPatternEngineTests.swift`) — two contract tests:

- `test_freshEngine_paletteIsAllZero` — documents the BUG-016 trap. A future change that seeds the engine with a non-zero default palette will trip this test, at which point the app-side `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack` call in `applyPreset` becomes redundant and can be removed.
- `test_setPalette_populatesAllTwelveSlots` — locks the `setPalette → snapshot.palette` contract that the app-side fix relies on.

**Verification criteria.**

- [x] **Automated:** engine test suite (1267 tests, 162 suites) passes; new `LumenPalettePayloadTests` suite passes (2 / 2). App test suite passes aside from 5 pre-existing parallel-execution timing flakes (`AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests` ×4 + `ToastManagerTests/autoDismiss_afterDuration`) — all 5 pass in isolation, none touch LM code paths.
- [x] **Manual (Matt):** Lumen Mosaic renders the certified vivid stained-glass visual when activated via `Shift+→` mid-track in a reactive-mode session ≥ 30 s held-on time. Per-beat palette dance is visible. No black-and-white-grid symptom. **Confirmed 2026-05-26** ("It works"). Black-and-white-grid symptom gone on mid-track switch.

**Manual validation is the load-bearing gate** per CLAUDE.md's Defect Handling Protocol for `preset.fidelity` domain. The new contract tests document the trap but cannot prove the visual symptom is gone — only Matt's M7-style review can.

**Trivial-collapse approval.** Matt explicitly approved the trivial-collapse single-increment process on 2026-05-26 (the standard P1/P2 protocol is five separate increments). Justification: < 30 LOC of behavior change, root cause obvious from code review, no architectural risk (additive call to an existing function with an existing identity).

---

### BUG-020 — Mid-track state reset (track-change callback firing spuriously)

**Severity:** P1 (visible artifact during steady-state playback — reported by Matt CSP.3.5 M7 of session `2026-05-28T18-31-06Z` as "some flickering around 40 s into playback for Love Rehab" after BUG-019 close).
**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-28** against Matt's M7 verdict on session `2026-05-28T19-59-20Z` (original Love Rehab → Money playlist, post-fix). Verdict: "none" perceptual flicker. Diagnostic shows clean 1:1 mapping between callback firings and accumulator resets across two post-fix M7 sessions (`19-50-25Z` shorter-songs + `19-59-20Z` original playlist), no false positives, no SUPPRESSED-line firings. The Spotify metadata jitter that produced the spurious event in the original diagnostic session (`19-21-18Z`) is intermittent and did not reproduce in the M7 sessions; the fix's catch path is correct by construction (gate matches the diagnosed spurious-event signature exactly) and will catch the jitter automatically if/when it re-occurs (visible as `WIRING: trackChangeCallback SUPPRESSED` log line). See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-s]`.
**Introduced:** Unknown; surfaced 2026-05-28 during CSP.3.5 M7 review. Was likely masked by the chronic PERF.3-era flicker before that fix landed.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-28 against Matt's "none" M7 verdict on session `2026-05-28T19-59-20Z`. Fix: commit `e9443e9f` (BUG-020.fix). Diagnostic instrumentation `594e4181` (BUG-020.diag) remains in place for ongoing auditing.

### Expected behavior

Once a track starts playing, `accumulatedAudioTime`, `valence`, `arousal`, `beatPhase01`, `bassAttRel`, and related per-track accumulators evolve smoothly until the next genuine track-change event. No mid-track state resets.

### Actual behavior

In session `2026-05-28T18-31-06Z`, at session-time 83.728 s (≈ 38 s into Love Rehab playback), the visualizer state resets within a single frame:

| Feature | Frame before (rel=83.711) | Frame after (rel=83.728) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `time` (wall-clock) | 122.28 | 122.30 (monotonic, fine) |
| `accumulatedAudioTime` | 5.8008 | **0.0002** |
| `valence` | 0.006 | **1.000** |
| `arousal` | 0.289 | **0.000** |
| `beatPhase01` | 0.834 | **0.000** |
| `bassAttRel` | -0.912 | -0.995 |

The pattern matches a track-change event firing (`mir.reset()` + `pipeline.resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` synchronously at `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:154-155`), but **the session log shows NO track-change event at that moment** — only "stem separation 6" at 18:32:30 (which doesn't touch these fields). The next logged track-change is Money at session-time 122 s.

The session-recorder log line for track-change is inside an async `Task { @MainActor }` block (lines 140-153 of the same file); the `mir.reset()` + `resetAccumulatedAudioTime()` fire synchronously OUTSIDE that task. This asymmetry means a spurious callback invocation can reset state without producing a corresponding log line, if the MainActor task is dropped/deferred/superseded.

Matt's perceptual symptom — flicker at 40 s into Love Rehab — maps directly: the visual state lurches because every state that drives FFO's appearance (mood tint, accumulated time for Gerstner waves, beat phase) snaps to defaults/extremes in one frame.

### Reproduction steps

1. Build PhospheneApp current main.
2. Start an LF playback session with love_rehab.m4a (the M7 session's source).
3. Play the file continuously past 40 s.
4. Observe: visible visual lurch around 38–40 s into playback. `features.csv` shows the multi-field reset at the same wall-clock moment.

**Minimum reproducer:** any track ≥ 40 s long played continuously without manual intervention. Whether it's content-specific or session-uptime-driven not yet determined.

### Session artifacts

- **Primary:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28T18-31-06Z/features.csv` — columns 22 / 19 / 20 / 23 / 26 show the reset pattern at frame ~5000.
- **Session log:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-28T18-31-06Z/session.log` — notable for the ABSENCE of a track-change line at 18:32:29.

### Suspected failure class

`pipeline-wiring`. Working hypotheses, none confirmed:

1. **Track-change publisher re-emits same-track event.** The publisher chain (Spotify metadata polling? LF playback metadata refresh? `AudioInputRouter` mode switch?) emits a `TrackChangeEvent` where `current` matches the actually-still-playing track. The callback fires its destructive reset regardless of whether the title changed.
2. **A second publisher is also fanning out track-change events.** LF.5 added file-association + Recents — if one of those paths emits its own track-change event for a same-file re-open, the callback fires.
3. **An orchestrator-driven re-evaluation triggers the callback.** Less likely given how the callback is wired, but worth ruling out.
4. **A timer-driven metadata-fetcher periodic refresh.** `MetadataPreFetcher` may be re-emitting on a fetch completion.

### Verification criteria

When this defect is resolved, the following must all pass:

- [ ] Automated: `features.csv` from a 60 s continuous-playback session shows no mid-track reset of `accumulatedAudioTime`, `valence`, `arousal`, `beatPhase01`.
- [ ] Manual: Matt's FFO M7 on a continuous-playback session of ≥ 60 s on any track reports no mid-track flickering/lurching.

**Manual validation required:** Yes. Perceptual confirmation required.

### Fix scope

Unknown until diagnose step lands. Multi-increment per the P1 defect protocol:

1. **Diagnostic instrumentation (BUG-020.diag)** — add synchronous log line at the top of the `makeTrackChangeCallback` callback so EVERY invocation is captured with `current` + `previous` + timestamp, regardless of whether the @MainActor task runs. Capture a session; identify the spurious caller.
2. **Diagnosis (BUG-020.cause)** — read the captured log; identify the publisher + caller chain producing the spurious event. Document root cause in this entry.
3. **Fix (BUG-020.fix)** — either eliminate the spurious publisher emission, or guard the callback's reset behind a same-track-identity short-circuit, depending on where the bug is.

### Related

- BUG-019 closeout (`[dev-2026-05-28-i]`) — this bug was masked by PERF.3-era brightness flicker before that fix landed; surfaced once the brightness residual stabilised.
- `[dev-2026-05-28-j]` LF.5 — added LF.5 multi-file playback path, a candidate source of spurious events.
- CLAUDE.md "What NOT To Do": "Do not match plan entries against the live track via lowercased title+artist string." That rule is about *plan walks*, not track-change events, but the underlying lesson (don't trust title+artist for identity) may apply if the publisher chain is using imprecise matching.

### BUG-LF5-1 — Orchestrator stayed REACTIVE for LF.5 multi-file sessions

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — commit `488afc1e` (`[LF.5.fix] D-LF5-1 + D-LF5-2`). Mirrored `makeTrackChangeCallback`'s orchestrator wire in `handleLocalFileReady` (planIdx=0) and `advanceLocalFileQueue` (planIdx=nextIdx).

**Severity:** P1. **Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`.
**Expected:** With an N-track `SessionPlan`, the orchestrator runs in planned mode and applies a per-track preset on each `currentTrackIndex` change.
**Actual:** Folder session `2026-05-28T17-06-08Z` log line 33: `Orchestrator: wire active (mode=reactive, planIdx=—, elapsedTrackTime=55.1s)`. Zero preset changes at the 8 track boundaries; the 4 preset transitions logged at 17:07:06–07 were autonomous reactive picks.
**Root cause:** Streaming wires the orchestrator via `makeTrackChangeCallback` (`VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:129`), which sets `liveTrackPlanIndex` under `orchestratorLock` so the analysis-queue `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate` can see the plan. LF.5's `handleLocalFileReady` + `advanceLocalFileQueue` updated the published `currentTrackIndex` but never wrote `liveTrackPlanIndex` — analysis queue saw `nil` → stayed reactive.
**Verification:** next folder session log should emit `Orchestrator: wire active (mode=planned, planIdx=0)` immediately after the first BeatGrid install + `planIdx=N` on each subsequent track change.

---

### BUG-LF5-2 — End Session did not stop LF audio playback

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — commit `488afc1e` (`[LF.5.fix] D-LF5-1 + D-LF5-2`). Extended the `sessionManager.$state` `.sink` in `VisualizerEngine` init to call `audioRouter.stop()` on `.ended`.

**Severity:** P1. **Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`.
**Expected:** Clicking "End session" on `PlaybackView` chrome (or the new transport-bar Stop button) stops local-file audio. Phosphene IS the player for LF sessions.
**Actual:** SessionManager transitioned to `.ended`, ContentView routed to EndedView, but audio kept playing because `LocalFilePlaybackProvider`'s `AVAudioEngine` was never torn down.
**Root cause:** `SessionManager.endSession()` only clears `currentSource` + flips state. The streaming-path equivalent is fine because Spotify/Apple Music owns playback there; for LF Phosphene owns playback and needs an explicit teardown.
**Verification:** session log after clicking End Session should show no further `stem separation N` lines (router stopped → no audio frames → no analysis ticks).

---

### BUG-LF5-3 — No music-player transport controls for LF sessions

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — commit `fe09a594` (`[LF.5.fix] D-LF5-3`). Hover-revealed Stop / Prev / Play-Pause / Next transport bar at the bottom-center of `PlaybackView` for `currentSource?.isLocalFile == true`. UX-2 amended in `UX_SPEC.md §7.3` + §10 to carve out the LF carve-out.

---

### BUG-LF5-4 — LF.5 sessions never built the multi-segment PlannedSession

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — commit `46a9f1c2` (`[LF.5.fix] D-LF5-4`). Surfaced by Matt's follow-up to D-LF5-1 closeout: "what happened to multiple presets per song?" One-line fix — call `buildPlan()` from `handleLocalFileReady` after the cache install + before the orchestrator wire.

**Severity:** P1. **Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`. **Companion to:** BUG-LF5-1 (which by itself was necessary but not sufficient — orchestrator could not run planned mode without a `livePlannedSession` to consult).
**Expected:** Multi-preset-per-song behaviour per `feedback_multi_preset_per_song.md` — the planner picks the best *set* of presets per track with intra-track segment boundaries placed where the music supports transitions.
**Actual (pre-fix):** `livePlannedSession == nil` for every LF.5 session; orchestrator had nothing to consult. Even after D-LF5-1's `liveTrackPlanIndex` writes landed, planned mode could not engage. Behaviour at the user surface: at best one autonomous-reactive preset per track-change boundary; in practice the reactive scheduler drifted on its own cadence (~7 s) ignoring boundaries entirely.
**Root cause:** VisualizerEngine's `.ready` observer branches on `currentSource?.isLocalFile` — streaming calls `buildPlan()`, LF calls `handleLocalFileReady()`. `handleLocalFileReady` installed BeatGrid + started audio but never called `buildPlan()`. The branching split was structural to LF.4's original wire-up and inherited by LF.5 without re-examination.
**Verification:** session log should show `Orchestrator: wire active (mode=planned, planIdx=0)` immediately after the first BeatGrid install and emit multiple `preset → <name>` lines within each track's playback window (matching the segmentation `SessionPlanner.plan(...)` generated for that track-and-trackProfile pair).

**Severity:** P2 (UX-spec gap rather than a code defect).
**Expected (Matt 2026-05-28):** Music-player UX with pause/skip/stop/forward/back when the user hovers during LF playback.
**Actual (pre-fix):** PlaybackView chrome had only "End session," which itself was broken (BUG-LF5-2). No way to pause, skip, or step back.
**Fix scope:** new `LocalFilePlaybackProvider.pause()` / `resume()` + `AudioInputRouter` shims + `VisualizerEngine.{togglePauseLocalFile, skipToNext/PreviousLocalFileTrack, stopLocalFilePlayback}` + `advanceLocalFileQueue(direction:)` extension + `LocalFileTransportBar` SwiftUI view + chrome wiring + 10 localized strings.
**Verification:** manual smoke — hover over playing window, transport bar appears centered at bottom; clicking Stop returns to IdleView with audio stopped; Prev at index 0 is a no-op; Play/Pause toggles audio without losing playhead; Next advances or transitions to EndedView at queue end.

### BUG-019 — Beat-dominant light intensity + spike-strength dead zone caused visible flicker on FFO

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-28** — Matt M7 verdict "Better" on session `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z` (CSP.3.4 build). Four-fix chain (PERF.3 + CSP.3.2 + CSP.3.3 + CSP.3.4) addressed the visible flicker / inactivity / artifact symptoms Matt has reported "since FFO existed." The originally-filed CPU-bump pattern (a separate phenomenon observed in two sessions) is characterized as probably-environmental and not actively pursued unless it returns with a clear non-environmental signal. Each fix went through its own M7 in succession; the chain is detailed under "Fix scope" below.

> **AMENDED 2026-05-28 — root cause re-characterized.** Initial filing described BUG-019 as "CPU frame time degrades after ~60 s of session uptime." That CPU bump pattern was observed in two sessions (`2026-05-27T21-12-48Z`, `2026-05-27T21-48-28Z`) but PERF.2-pass instrumentation (capture `2026-05-27T22-49-42Z`) ruled out the audio analysis pipeline AND the per-ray-march-sub-pass dispatch as the source. The CPU bump appears to be probably-environmental (system-level memory pressure / GPU contention) and intermittent. Meanwhile the **consistent visible perceptual symptom Matt has reported "since FFO existed"** — flickering, lag, brief hangs, coming out of sync — was caught by ffmpeg signalstats on `2026-05-27T22-49-42Z`'s rendered video.mp4: 76 brightness-oscillation events across 200 s, each aligned with a beat-detector firing. Root cause: `applyAudioModulation` in `RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift` had `intensityMul = 0.4 + beatPulse * 2.6` — beat 6.5× the baseline, direct violation of CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #4 ("beat is accent, never primary"). Every beat fired a 2.1× single-frame brightness multiplier swing. Fix landed as PERF.3 (`RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-e]`); M7 pending.

**Severity:** P1 (load-bearing for "FFO doesn't flicker" — Matt's quality bar across multiple iterations; the symptom blocked the SAR.1 / CSP.3 / CSP.3.1 M7s).
**Domain tag:** `perf` → amended to `renderer` (per-frame lighting content, not timing).
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-28** against Matt's CSP.3.4 M7 ("Better") on session `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z`. Brightness oscillation count stabilised at 53–60 events across post-fix sessions (vs 76 pre-fix). Visible spike-tip artifacts gone. Continuous spike-height modulation throughout each track. PERF.3 brightness fix unchanged across the CSP.3.x iterations.
**Introduced:** The `applyAudioModulation` formula has existed since the deferred ray-march path was first added — predates any of the recent preset work. The bug is structural to the engine's preset-agnostic lighting modulation. Matt's "this has existed for as long as FFO has existed" is consistent — FFO surfaces this most loudly because of its dark-substrate-with-mirror-reflections character.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-28. Four-fix chain: PERF.3 (commit `f0627c19`) + CSP.3.2 (`acf357dd`) + CSP.3.3 (`21874a13`) + CSP.3.4 (`62704e16`). See "Fix scope" below for the full sequence.

### Expected behavior

CPU frame time stays under the 60 fps budget of 16.67 ms for the full duration of a session. p95 sits comfortably under tier budget; no sustained over-budget windows during steady-state playback. No visible flickering / artifacts / hangs.

### Actual behavior

CPU frame time roughly doubles around 60–68 seconds of session uptime and remains elevated for the rest of the session. GPU frame time is stable throughout — the bottleneck is purely CPU, not the render pipeline.

**M7 session evidence — `2026-05-27T21-12-48Z` (post-SAR.1, tap path, FFO preset, Billie Jean → Superstition):**

| Window (session-time) | CPU avg | CPU max | GPU avg | GPU max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0–60 s | 10–12 ms | 16–18 ms | 8–10 ms | 14–15 ms |
| 66–90 s | **22–24 ms** | **28–30 ms** | 8–10 ms | 14–15 ms |

At 22–24 ms per frame, roughly 1 in 3 frames misses the 16.67 ms deadline. Matt's perceptual report: "Screen flickers and it looks like there are visual artifacts for a split second while the screen temporarily hangs. Looks like a performance bug — like the visualizer is overloaded." Matt's timing estimate ("around 25 s through end of playback") aligns with ~15 s into Superstition (the second track) where session-time hits 68 s — i.e. the symptom appears in the second track because the trigger window happens to fall inside it.

Within the elevated window the per-frame trace shows a periodic ~250 ms sawtooth (~4 Hz), suggesting one or more subsystems doing burst work on that cadence rather than per-frame steady cost.

**Pre-SAR.1 reference — `2026-05-27T19-52-42Z` (pre-fix, tap path, same general track set):**

| Window (session-time) | CPU avg | CPU max |
|---|---:|---:|
| 0–50 s | 13.7 ms | 17–18 ms |
| 60–90 s | **17–18 ms** | **30.6 ms (60–70 s window); one 103.9 ms spike at 70–80 s** |

Same shape, less severe in averages but with a much worse one-off spike. The two sessions confirm the pattern is pre-existing rather than introduced by SAR.1.

**LF-path sessions (`2026-05-27T19-44-25Z`, `2026-05-27T19-47-18Z`) ran at 1.3–1.4 ms CPU avg throughout** — local-file playback bypasses the process tap path and shows none of this degradation. The bottleneck lives in the tap-path live-analysis pipeline, not in any shared component.

### Reproduction steps

1. Build PhospheneApp (current `main`, post-SAR.1 — the bug pre-dates SAR.1 so any recent build will reproduce).
2. Start an ad-hoc tap-path session (Spotify prepared playlist, FFO preset).
3. Play tracks continuously past the 60 s session-uptime mark.
4. Observe: visible flickering / brief hangs from ~60 s session-time onwards; `features.csv` `frame_cpu_ms` column doubles from ~10 ms to ~22 ms in the same window.

**Minimum reproducer:** any tap-path session that runs continuously past ~60–70 s. Track content does not appear to matter; the trigger correlates with session uptime, not track-specific audio.

### Session artifacts

- **Primary:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T21-12-48Z/features.csv` — columns 36 (`frame_cpu_ms`) and 37 (`frame_gpu_ms`) show the doubling at frame ~4080 (session-time 67–68 s).
- **Pre-SAR.1 reference:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-52-42Z/features.csv` — same shape, slightly milder.
- **LF-path counter-example:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-44-25Z/features.csv` and `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-47-18Z/features.csv` — sustained 1.3–1.4 ms CPU throughout, ruling out shared (renderer / GPU / common-DSP) components.

### Suspected failure class

`resource-management` (most likely) or `algorithm`. Working hypotheses, none confirmed:

1. **Accumulating state in the tap-path live-analysis pipeline.** The stem separator runs every 5 s; the live stem analyzer feeds the analyzer per frame. Some component may be accumulating bookkeeping (lists, ring buffers, EMA state) that gets walked or copied on every frame, with cost that grows over session uptime.
2. **A code-path that engages after a track-elapsed-time gate.** Live stems converge ~13–15 s into a track (the CSP.3 timeline). If the live path has heavier per-frame cost than the cached path, and live stems coming online during the *second* track (after ~60 s session-time) coincides with the trigger window, the bump would land where it does. Doesn't explain why the same gate didn't fire 15 s into the first track at session-time ~22 s where CPU was still ~11 ms.
3. **Cross-track state-reset incompleteness.** A buffer / accumulator / EMA owned by an analysis component isn't being cleared on track change and is paying a cost that's a function of how much data it has seen so far.
4. **Thermal throttling.** Apple Silicon performance cores can throttle if sustained CPU load pushes thermal headroom; the M7 session was the second of several runs that afternoon. Doesn't fully explain why GPU stays flat (thermal usually affects both).

The ~4 Hz / 250 ms sawtooth visible in the per-frame CPU trace is a discriminator — something is firing on that period after the trigger, and identifying it would likely identify the subsystem.

**Evidence for `resource-management`:** the same shape appears in multiple independent sessions, the trigger is session-uptime-driven not audio-content-driven, and the LF path (which bypasses some analysis components) is completely unaffected.

### Verification criteria

When this defect is resolved, the following must all pass:

- [ ] Automated: `FrameTimingReporter` p95 ≤ tier budget (Tier 2 budget 16.67 ms at 60 fps) over a 90 s continuous tap-path session.
- [ ] Automated: 2-hour `SoakTestHarness` run shows no monotonic CPU-time growth past tier budget.
- [ ] Domain artifact: `features.csv` from a 90 s tap-path session shows `frame_cpu_ms` distribution with no second-half doubling vs first-half.
- [ ] Manual: Matt's FFO M7 (or any other certified preset M7) — no perceived flickering / hangs / artifacts throughout a continuous-playback session of ≥ 90 s.

**Manual validation required:** Yes. The defect surfaced as a perceptual report; closing it requires a perceptual confirmation, not just a green automated gate.

### Fix scope

Unknown — needs the instrumentation increment first. **Multi-increment** per the P1 defect protocol:

1. **Instrumentation (PERF.1) ✅ 2026-05-28** — five new `features.csv` columns. See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-b]`.
2. **Diagnosis (PERF.2) ✅ 2026-05-28** — analysis pipeline ruled out.
3. **Instrumentation extension (PERF.2-render) ✅ 2026-05-28** — `encode_cpu_ms` + `renderframe_cpu_ms`. See `[dev-2026-05-28-c]`.
4. **Diagnosis (PERF.2-render) ✅ 2026-05-28** — bump localised to `renderFrame()` pass dispatch.
5. **Instrumentation extension (PERF.2-pass) ✅ 2026-05-28** — four sub-pass columns. See `[dev-2026-05-28-d]`.
6. **Diagnosis (PERF.2-pass) ✅ 2026-05-28** — session `2026-05-27T22-49-42Z`: all four sub-passes flat across a Matt-confirmed flicker session. **CPU bump pattern is NOT in our render-path code.** The chronic perceptual flicker, separately diagnosed via ffmpeg signalstats on the same session's video.mp4, traces to the beat-dominant `applyAudioModulation` formula.
7. **Fix (PERF.3) ✅ 2026-05-28** — `intensityMul` formula restructured: `1.0 + bass * 0.4 + beatAccent * 0.15` (was `0.4 + beatPulse * 2.6`). Single-frame brightness swing reduced 14×. See `[dev-2026-05-28-e]`.
8. **Validation (PERF.3 M7) ✅ 2026-05-28 — partial-pass** — Matt's session `2026-05-28T03-10-29Z`: brightness flicker reduced ("Love Rehab looked great for about a minute") + `ffmpeg signalstats` count dropped 76 → 57 events (25 %). New visible issue surfaced — "inactivity from the spikes" — root-caused to `stems.bass_energy_dev` averaging 0.05–0.10 in warm state, making CSP.3.1's `+0.35 × bass_energy_dev` term effectively zero. PERF.3 had been masking this with its own brightness flicker.
9. **Fix (CSP.3.2) ✅ 2026-05-28** — `fo_spike_strength` dropped the warm-state crossfade to `stems.bass_energy_dev`; uses `f.bass` (AGC-normalised continuous Layer 1) for the whole track. Same shape as PERF.3 — continuous primitive primary, no deviation-primitive dead zones — applied to spike geometry. See `[dev-2026-05-28-f]`.
10. **Validation (CSP.3.2 M7) ✅ 2026-05-28 — partial-pass** — session `2026-05-28T13-20-21Z`: irregular behavior gone (confirmed by Matt) and continuous modulation throughout track (confirmed by data), but magnitude too small. The 0.35 coefficient (inherited from pre-CSP.3.2) was tuned against the deviation primitive's pre-SAR.1 saturation; for `f.bass`'s actual distribution (85 % of frames < 0.3), 0.35 produces < 11 % modulation — below perception.
11. **Fix (CSP.3.3) ✅ 2026-05-28** — coefficient bump 0.35 → 0.8. Typical modulation 17 %, peaks 40 %. See `[dev-2026-05-28-g]`.
12. **Validation (CSP.3.3 M7) ✅ 2026-05-28 — partial-pass** — session `2026-05-28T13-31-47Z`: "spike subtlety has been addressed sufficiently" + irregular behavior gone — but gray-tip artifacts on heavy bass hits in Money + flickering around 38 s into Love Rehab. Diagnosed as Lipschitz overshoot: post-CSP.3.3 spike strengths (1.25–2.05) produce effective gradients (4.6–7.5) exceeding the `/4` divisor's safe ceiling (4).
13. **Fix (CSP.3.4) ✅ 2026-05-28** — Lipschitz divisor `/4` → `/10`. See `[dev-2026-05-28-h]`.
14. **Validation (CSP.3.4 M7) ✅ 2026-05-28** — session `2026-05-28T13-50-23Z`: Matt verdict "Better." Brightness oscillation events 60 (within the post-PERF.3 band of 53–60 — fix unchanged). Gray-tip artifacts and 38 s Love Rehab flicker gone. Spike-height magnitude preserved from CSP.3.3. BUG-019 closed against the original symptom.
15. **Post-close regression — CSP.3.4 side effects** — Matt M7 of session `2026-05-28T17-50-42Z` (LF playback, love_rehab.m4a) reported "white artifacts at spike tips close to camera + white substrate patches in the far-left corner." Diagnosed: CSP.3.4's `/10` divisor made each ray-march step 60 % smaller than `/4`; the 128-step iteration cap (`PresetLoader+Preamble.swift:418`, unchanged) was exhausted on rays at oblique view angles → fell to "Sky / miss" path → FFO's matID == 2 mirror paradigm rendered procedural sky as white. Also breached the 60 fps CPU budget (17.14 ms avg vs 16.67 ms ceiling).
16. **Fix (CSP.3.5) ⚠ doc-only 2026-05-28** — commit `eaaadd9b` claimed divisor `/10` → `/6` but rewrote only the comment block; the operative `return (p.y - surfaceY) / 10.0;` line was unchanged. Surfaced by `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` reproducibly failing on Ferrofluid Ocean across the CSP.3.4→CSP.3.5.1 interval (`formComplexity → 1`, every pixel rendering as sky/miss because `/10` starves the hardcoded 128-step march budget at the rubric fixture). The trade-off analysis (covers all typical playback: Money 1.36, LR ≤ 1.30, M7 session 1.52; rare `f.bass ≥ 1.0` peaks may produce brief gray-tip flicker) stands and applies to CSP.3.5.1. See `[dev-2026-05-28-n]` (with AMENDED note).
17. **Validation (CSP.3.5 M7) — superseded** — Matt did not M7 `/6` against the CSP.3.5 build because `/10` was still operative. The M7 protocol (white artifacts gone, CPU back under budget, spike magnitude preserved from CSP.3.3, PERF.3 brightness fix preserved) applies to CSP.3.5.1.
18. **Fix completion (CSP.3.5.1) ✅ 2026-05-28** — apply the intended `/6` to the operative line. Single-line shader change + amended `[dev-2026-05-28-h]` + `[dev-2026-05-28-n]` for the wrong test-count claims, + this step. Trivial-P1 collapse per CLAUDE.md Defect Handling Protocol (< 5 lines, root cause obvious from `git show eaaadd9b` + existing CSP.3.5 comment block, no architectural risk). Engine: 1358 / 1358 tests pass; `PresetAcceptanceTests.test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` now passes for FFO. See `[dev-2026-05-28-o]`.

Matt verdict: "M7 review looks good. white artifacts are gone, performance looks good." `features.csv` cpu_mean 13.39 ms (under 16.67 ms budget; down from `/10` build's 17.14 ms). PERF.3 brightness fix preservation relies on Matt's perceptual verdict — `ffmpeg signalstats` corroborator unavailable because `video.mp4` is missing a `moov` atom (separate concern, follow-up task spawned). **BUG-019 resolution confirmed against the operative `/6` build.** See `[dev-2026-05-28-p]`.

### Disposition

The bug as filed described two phenomena conflated under one symptom: (a) **chronic visible flicker** on every FFO playback session, and (b) the **sustained CPU bump** observed in two specific sessions. PERF.2-pass empirically separated them: (a) is in our `applyAudioModulation` lighting formula and is fixed by PERF.3; (b) is not in our per-pass dispatch and appears probably-environmental (other ray-march presets show the same pattern intermittently; one session even self-recovered with a 96 ms hitch). Closing the bug against (a) once M7 confirms; (b) characterized but not actively pursued unless it returns with a clear non-environmental signal.

### Related

- Increment: SAR.1 — surfaced this bug because SAR.1's math-layer fix landed cleanly while Matt's M7 verdict was "no different" visually; investigation traced the residual symptom to CPU pressure rather than to the deviation primitives SAR.1 touched.
- Phase CSP — **paused** until BUG-019 is at least diagnosed. No point tuning FFO's cold-start consumer at the shader layer while ~30 % of frames are missing their deadline.
- Capability: `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PERFORMANCE.md` (if/when this defect is closed, the entry there gets the validation evidence).

### BUG-017 — Cold-start visual beat carries a per-track phase offset (preview-clip phase used as track phase)

> **AMENDED 2026-05-26 — BSAudit.3.impl was reverted on 2026-05-25 evening.** Commits `33cd57e9` / `6758a617` / `002b5f2b` / `35305b5e` backed out the impl runtime after Choice A's "doc-only closeout" (`438edbbb`, same day, earlier). The diagnostic tooling (`--accent-window-pass-rate` verifier mode, the 4 new SelfTest checks, the diagnostic findings doc, the historical baseline doc) was retained per Matt's "yes, keep the tools" sign-off. Production is the pre-impl baseline; the resolution against the accepted structural limit still holds, but the runtime architecture described below as "production" is no longer in the code. The text below preserves the BSAudit.3.impl narrative as historical record; see CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract for the current production state. See `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-26-b]` for the revert narrative.

**Severity:** P1 (load-bearing product claim — "beat-synced from frame 1 of every track", Matt's Phase CS bar 2026-05-20. CS.1 empirical verification: 7 of 10 tracks fail the ±50 ms bar. Not session-blocking — the session plays and the BUG-007.9 runtime recalibration partially corrects after ~15 s — so not P0.)
**Domain tag:** `dsp.beat`
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-25 (closed against accepted structural limit — see addendum 2026-05-25 below; AMENDED 2026-05-26 to reflect that the BSAudit.3.impl runtime described as "production" in the resolution was itself reverted same-day).** Six fix-class iterations (CS.1 → CS.1.y.1 → CS.1.y.2 → CS.1.y.2-redo r1 → r2 → BSAudit.3.impl) exhausted the available short-window automated signals for cold-start beat-phase derivation; the BSAudit.3.diag.1 root-cause dive empirically falsified the premise that the audible beat phase can be recovered from the first ~3 s of live tap audio (CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #69). Matt's Choice A decision 2026-05-25 accepted the ±60 ms / 3 s perceptual sync sub-goal as structurally unachievable; the initial closeout retained BSAudit.3.impl as production, but the runtime was reverted the same evening (`33cd57e9` / `6758a617` / `002b5f2b` / `35305b5e`), leaving only the diagnostic tooling in place. Production is the pre-impl baseline; the structural limit holds independent of the runtime in place.
**Introduced:** Pre-CS.1. The cold-start grid-install path (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:485`, `cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0)`) and the preview-only `GridOnsetCalibrator` (`GridOnsetCalibrator.swift:13`) predate this filing — part of the BUG-007.x cold-start infrastructure series. The preview-vs-track phase gap was never closed; CS.1's verification harness surfaced it empirically 2026-05-22.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-25, against accepted structural limit. Initial closeout architecture: commits `efaf8cb4..30d032ea` (BSAudit.3.impl.1/.2/.3 — BPM prior install + broadband-peak phase acquisition + confidence-gated accents + `GridOnsetCalibrator` retirement). **The impl runtime was reverted 2026-05-25 evening** (`33cd57e9` / `6758a617` / `002b5f2b` / `35305b5e`); production reverted to the pre-impl baseline (`GridOnsetCalibrator` reinstated, no `accentConfidence` field, no BPM-prior phase acquisition, ungated beat accents). Diagnostic infrastructure retained: `515f9b89` (validate.1 — `--accent-window-pass-rate` verifier mode), `cf83037c` (validate.2 — historical baseline), `346f7487` (BSAudit.3.diag.1 — per-track diagnostic + root-cause findings). Closeout: addendum 2026-05-25 below + [`docs/diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md`](../diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md) + CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract + Failed Approach #69.

### Expected behavior

Per Matt's Phase CS bar (`docs/COLD_START_SYNC_DESIGN_2026-05-20.md` §3): from frame 1 of every track, the visual beat (`beatPhase01` wrap) lands within ±50 ms of the audible beat; ≥ 90 % of beats in the first 10 s within tolerance; ≥ 90 % of tracks passing.

### Actual behavior

CS.1's `ColdStartVerifier` harness, run on the full-session capture `2026-05-22T16-57-36Z` (10 tracks; Beat This! one-beat-per-beat audible reference; clock offset pinned via the precise raw-tap-start timestamp added to `SessionRecorder` in CS.1):

**3 of 10 tracks pass; 7 fail.** Per-track median visual-vs-audible offset over the first 10 s:

| Track | Median Δ | Within ±50 ms | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Around the World | +28 ms | 95 % | pass |
| Get Lucky | +17 ms | 90 % | pass |
| Royals | +8 ms | 93 % | pass |
| Billie Jean | +69 ms | 10 % | fail |
| Seven Nation Army | +93 ms | 35 % | fail |
| Superstition | −28 ms | 44 % | fail |
| Everlong | −66 ms | 23 % | fail |
| B.O.B. | +10 ms | 73 % | fail |
| HUMBLE. | +338 ms | 0 % | fail |
| Money | −128 ms | 0 % | fail |

The offset is a **per-track systematic phase error, not jitter** — within each track the per-beat deltas are tight (HUMBLE: every beat +320 to +364 ms, MAD ~15 ms). The errors span −128 to +338 ms, all within ±½-beat of the track tempo. HUMBLE (76 BPM, 790 ms period) is ~0.43 beat off.

### Reproduction steps

1. Rebuild + launch the app (CS.1's `SessionRecorder` precise raw-tap-start change in tree).
2. Set `PHOSPHENE_FULL_RAW_TAP=1` in the Xcode scheme; play a ~10-track Spotify-prepared playlist.
3. `swift run ColdStartVerifier --session <dir>` (from `PhospheneEngine/`).
4. Observe: < 90 % of tracks pass the ±50 ms / 90 % bar; per-track median offsets span > 400 ms.

**Minimum reproducer:** any Spotify-prepared playlist. The defect is structural — the cold-start grid phase is set from the preview clip on every track.

### Session artifacts

- Session: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-22T16-57-36Z/`
- Evidence pack: `<session>/cold_start_report.md` (full per-track table, failure dives, clock offsets).

### Suspected failure class

`calibration`. The cold-start beat grid is not calibrated to the track's actual start phase.

**Root cause (CS.1.x diagnosis — code-level evidence):**

1. **`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:485`** installs the cold-start grid as `cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0)`. `cached.beatGrid` is Beat This! run on the **30-second Spotify preview clip**. `.offsetBy(0)` uses the preview clip's timeline as the track's timeline verbatim. But the preview is an arbitrary 30 s excerpt — its position in the full track is unknown — so the grid's beat phase, applied from track t=0, is off by the preview clip's arbitrary phase offset, folding to ±½-beat per track.
2. **`GridOnsetCalibrator`** (the `initialDriftMs` seed) runs on the **preview audio** (`GridOnsetCalibrator.swift:13`). It measures the Beat This!-vs-onset-detector latency *within the preview* — it never sees the live track start, so it structurally cannot measure or correct the preview-vs-track phase error. This is why the frame-1 `drift_ms` seed is small (±60 ms) while the real offset is 60–338 ms — they are different quantities.
3. The **live drift tracker** corrects small continuous drift via an EMA — it does not make a gross ½-beat phase jump (HUMBLE stays +338 ms even post-"lock").
4. The **BUG-007.9 runtime recalibration** (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` `recalibrateGridFromTapAudio`) re-calibrates against live tap audio — but only after ~15 s of buffered tap audio (outside the 10 s cold-start window), and its `GridOnsetCalibrator` has a ±200 ms `maxMatchWindow` (`GridOnsetCalibrator.swift:41`) that silently returns 0 (no correction) when the true offset exceeds 200 ms — so it cannot fix the worst cases even later.

The 3 passing tracks are tracks whose preview clip happened to start near a beat boundary (small phase error).

### Verification criteria (write before the fix)

- [ ] Automated: `ColdStartVerifier` on a fresh full-session capture reports ≥ 90 % of tracks passing the ±50 ms / 90 % bar.
- [ ] Manual: Matt's M7 perceptual review on a real listening-party playlist confirms the visuals are beat-synced from frame 1.
- [ ] Regression: the BUG-007.x lock state machine and steady-state tracking are preserved — the fix adds a cold-start phase acquisition and must not destabilise the steady-state tracker.

### Fix scope

Multi-increment (P1). The fix must give the cold-start the **track-start phase**, whose only source is the live tap audio from frame 1. Direction:

- A cold-start phase acquisition: in the first ~1–2 s of playback, phase-lock the grid (correct tempo, wrong phase) to the first live sub-bass onsets — a gross phase correction up front — rather than trusting the preview clip's phase and waiting for the 15 s recalibration.
- Widen or remove the ±200 ms `maxMatchWindow` cap so gross corrections are not discarded.
- Touches the cold-start grid-install path (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) and `LiveBeatDriftTracker`. Design before code — the change interacts with the BUG-007.x lock state machine.

To be scoped as a follow-up increment; not started in this diagnosis increment.

> **Superseded (2026-05-22).** The "phase-lock to the first live sub-bass onsets" direction above was implemented in CS.1.y.2, failed validation, and was reverted — the sub-bass onset detector is not a beat-phase reference. See the CS.1.y.2 addendum below for the failure analysis and the Beat This!-based replacement direction.

### Addendum (CS.1.y.2 — fix attempt failed validation, reverted, 2026-05-22)

CS.1.y.2 implemented an in-tracker **cold-start phase acquisition** (commit `dbcc018d`): collect the first live sub-bass onsets, take the circular mean of their nearest-beat residuals, and — on a confident cluster (resultant `R ≥ 0.95`) — apply a one-shot gross `drift` correction. The engine suite was green (1272 tests). CS.1.y.3 validation **failed** and the commit was **reverted** (`f71b0456`).

**Validation result.** `ColdStartVerifier` on capture `2026-05-22T19-03-59Z` (post-fix build): **0 / 10 tracks pass — worse than CS.1's 3 / 10.** The three tracks that passed pre-fix (Around the World +28 → +129 ms, Get Lucky +17 → +198 ms, Royals +8 → +316 ms) all regressed by 100–300 ms.

**Root cause — the onset-based fix direction is unsound.** The fix phase-locks the grid to the first live sub-bass onsets, on the premise (CS.1.y.1 / the §Fix scope bullet 1 above) that those onsets pin the *beat* phase. They do not. The sub-bass onset detector fires on sub-bass *events* (bass notes, 808s, synth bass), and on syncopated tracks those are **off-beat** — verified per-track: Billie Jean's syncopated bassline → onsets −226 ms off the beat; Royals → +316 ms; Get Lucky → +198 ms. The cold-start aligned the visual onto the onset phase (`visual = liveOnset`, a direct algebraic consequence of `drift = mean(cachedGridBeat − liveOnset)`), i.e. onto the bassline, not the beat. The error is dead-steady across the whole 10 s window (MAD ~10 ms — not warmup, not jitter), and both signs / 500 ms spread rule out detector processing latency. Because the off-beat clusters are *tight*, they pass the `R ≥ 0.95` confidence gate — **the gate measures cluster tightness, not whether the cluster is on the beat**, and a syncopated bassline produces a tight, confident, wrong cluster. No threshold tuning fixes this; the signal (sub-bass onsets) is structurally not a beat-phase reference. The fix also specifically *destroyed* the tracks that worked: it overrides the (sometimes-fine) preview-calibration seed with the (always-off-beat-on-syncopated-tracks) live-onset measurement.

The baseline tolerates off-beat onsets only because the steady-state EMA's ±50 ms onset-match window *hard-rejects* them — it trusts the cached grid and uses onsets as weak confirmation. That same ±50 ms window is also exactly why the baseline cannot make the gross correction BUG-017 needs; the two are inseparable in the current architecture.

**New fix direction (CS.1.y.2-redo, to be designed with Matt).** The only reliable track-start *beat*-phase source is Beat This! itself — not the sub-bass onset detector. (`ColdStartVerifier`'s own ground-truth reference is Beat This! re-run on the tap audio, and those beat times are clean.) The direction: run Beat This! on the first few seconds of live tap audio and correct the cached grid's phase from it — both sides Beat This!, no onset-vs-beat confusion. `performLiveBeatInference` (`VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) already runs Beat This! on live tap at 10 s. **Open question / load-bearing pre-work:** whether Beat This! produces an accurate *phase* on a short (~4–6 s) window, and whether that window fits Matt's "~3 s" budget — to be answered by an offline measurement increment before any code (the cached grid already supplies a reliable tempo; only phase is needed).

**Verification criteria #1/#2 (above) unchanged.** The verification-criteria checkboxes remain the close gate for whatever CS.1.y.2-redo lands.

### Addendum (CS.1.y re-diagnosis — short-window Beat This! found unusable, 2026-05-22)

The CS.1.y.2-redo step-1 measurement (offline; `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose`, commit `b27226d3`) tested the open question above: can Beat This! on a short (3/4/5 s) window of live tap audio reproduce the beat *phase* of full-window Beat This! (the verifier's audible-beat reference)? It cannot.

- **Capture `2026-05-22T16-57-36Z`: 3/10 tracks viable** (≤ 30 ms, R ≥ 0.90) at every window length. **Capture `2026-05-22T19-03-59Z`: 1–2/10.**
- **Non-reproducible across captures.** The same track recorded twice gives different short-window phase: Everlong is clean (R 0.98, ±6 ms) in the first capture and **unstable** (±211 ms swing across 3/4/5 s) in the second; Around the World, Seven Nation Army flip likewise. Only Royals is viable in both. A fix built on a signal that is not reproducible per track would behave differently every session.
- **HUMBLE**: short-window phase is garbage and wildly unstable (−202 / −161 / +269 ms across 3/4/5 s).
- **Money**: Beat This! finds **no beats at all** in the first 3/4/5 s — its intro is the looped cash-register/coin SFX, so there is no beat in the cold-start window to sync to (structurally unfixable).
- **B.O.B.**: short-window Beat This! returns degenerate/empty grids (0–3 beats).

**Root cause:** the existing `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer.analyzeBeatGrid` bundles Beat This! inference with `BeatGridResolver`'s tempo estimation, and short windows degrade tempo (Failed Approaches #50/#51). Small changes in window length flip the output (Superstition's resultant collapses 0.95 → 0.26 → 0.19 as the window *grows*). A measurement caveat: the harness uses `analyzeBeatGrid`, so it cannot isolate whether Beat This!'s raw beat-activation output (before the resolver) is more stable than the full pipeline — but beat *count* itself flips across window lengths, which points at the transformer's activations, not just the resolver.

**Where this leaves BUG-017.** Three signal sources have now been tried and exhausted: live sub-bass onsets (CS.1.y.2 — off-beat, reverted), short-window Beat This! (this re-diagnosis — erratic, non-reproducible), and the cached grid alone (CS.1 baseline — 3/10 pass). None achieves the bar (≥ 90 % within ±50 ms from frame 1, ≤ 5 s budget). The only reliable beat reference is full-window (~15–25 s) Beat This!, which by definition is not available inside the cold-start window. **The bar as specified is not achievable under the streaming-only constraint with the tools available.** That is a product-level finding, and it was put to Matt.

**Decision (2026-05-22).** Matt's call: do not chase fast (≤ 5 s) phase acquisition. Cold-start uses the cached grid as-is from frame 1 — which CS.1 showed is *approximately* right already (8/10 tracks within ±130 ms). Then, at ~15–20 s, run full-window live Beat This! on the tap audio and phase-correct the cached grid to it (a one-time snap to exact). Product claim: "approximately synced immediately, locked within ~20 s." The fix (**CS.1.y.2-redo**) supersedes the onset-based and short-window directions; it is closely related to the existing `performLiveBeatInference` live-Beat This! path (currently runs only when no grid is installed) and to BUG-007.9 runtime recalibration (currently `GridOnsetCalibrator`-based — the unreliable onset tool). To be designed design-first before any code.

### Addendum (CS.1.y.2-redo redo.1 + redo.2 — implementation landed, awaiting validation, 2026-05-22)

The CS.1.y.2-redo design surfaced to Matt before code; snap = instant snap (Matt-ratified). Implemented in two halves:

**redo.1 (Step 1 window-length measurement) ✅.** Extended `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose` to take `--rediagnose-windows` (default `3,4,5` preserved). Ran on both captures with `10,15,20`. Result: **at 15 s, phase reproducibly ≤ 8 ms across both captures on every track including HUMBLE and Money; at 20 s, ≤ 6 ms.** Decisive vs the 3/4/5 s re-diagnosis (1-3/10). Reports written to `<capture>/cold_start_rediagnosis_10-15-20.md`. **W = 15 s ratified** by Matt. The bundled "viable" verdict (8-9/10) folded a strict R ≥ 0.90 gate that's tempo-jitter-sensitive — the *raw phase* (what the fix needs) is 10/10 within ±30 ms at 15-20 s. The redo.2 confidence gate is loose by design.

**redo.2 (implementation) ✅.** No new architecture — the fix swaps the *measurement tool* inside BUG-007.9's `runtimeRecalibrationIfDue`. Specifics:

- **Engine** — new `LiveBeatDriftTracker.applyColdStartPhaseCorrection(liveGrid:)` computes the circular-mean phase residual between the installed cached grid and a passed-in live Beat This! grid; gates with degenerate-only guards (≥ 8 live beats, live BPM within ±15 % of cached BPM) plus a loose R floor (0.5); applies via the existing drift-set path (no grid reinstall, no lock-state reset). `applyCalibration` refactored to share `setDriftLocked` with the new method.
- **Engine tests** — `LiveBeatDriftTrackerColdStartPhaseTests.swift` adds 8 contracts including the load-bearing **lock state, matchedOnsets, and drift-EMA ring are preserved across the correction** check (the BUG-007.x regression guard).
- **App** — `runtimeRecalibrationIfDue` reworked: snapshot 15 s of tap audio, run `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer.analyzeBeatGrid`, shift to track-relative time, call the new engine method. **Dropped the `matchedOnsetCount ≥ 8` gate** that would never open on ½-beat-off tracks (the exact failure case BUG-017 is about — onsets can't match a wrong grid within ±50 ms). `stemSampleBuffer.maxSeconds` 15 → 18 (15 s window on a 48 kHz tap needs ~16.5 s of model-rate capacity; cost ~0.6 MB). `GridOnsetCalibrator` retained only for its prep-time `gridOnsetOffsetMs` seed.
- **Verifier** — new `--window-start-s` option for measuring the post-snap window (redo.3 needs `--window-start-s 20`).

Verification:
- Engine suite: **1273 / 1273 pass** (1265 baseline + 8 new cold-start tests).
- App build clean; project-wide `swiftlint --strict`: 0 violations across 380 files.
- `ColdStartVerifier --self-test`: PASS (7/7).

**Pending — redo.3 (validation).** Matt: produce a fresh full-session capture with `PHOSPHENE_FULL_RAW_TAP=1` on the post-fix build. Then `ColdStartVerifier --session <capture> --window-start-s 20` should show ≥ 90 % within ±50 ms in the post-snap window. Then M7 perceptual review with attention on HUMBLE and Money (the verifier-circularity tracks). On M7 pass: BUG-017 flips to Resolved with the commit hash; ENGINEERING_PLAN CS.1.y to ✅; `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-22-d]` records closeout.

### Addendum (CS.1.y.2-redo redo.3 round 1 failed and round-1 fix did not converge — implementation reverted 2026-05-24)

Three validation captures across 2026-05-22 → 2026-05-24 established that the CS.1.y.2-redo fix does **not** converge perceptually. **Reverted 2026-05-24.** What stays in tree: the `ColdStartVerifier --rediagnose-windows` + `--window-start-s` diagnostic tooling (commit `976a78b3`). What was reverted: the engine `applyColdStartPhaseCorrection` method + 8 regression tests; the app `runtimeRecalibrationIfDue` rework + `stemSampleBuffer` 15 → 18 bump; the live-grid extrapolation follow-up fix.

**Evidence chain:**

| Capture | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `2026-05-23T02-17-24Z` (round 1) | Engine bug — fix passed default `horizon: 300` to `BeatGrid.offsetBy` for the live grid, inflating residuals over the 300 s extrapolation. 3/10 tracks applied with `matched=600+` (should be ~30) and inflated drifts. Fixed in `1e77fdf6` (`horizon: 0`). |
| `2026-05-23T02-39-54Z` (round 2 post-fix) | Engine signatures clean (`matched ≈ 21-39`, R high). Verifier post-snap window: 4/7 PASS, 3/7 FAIL + 3 DEGENERATE. **Two regressions on previously-passing tracks**: Get Lucky (95 % PASS pre-snap → 0 % FAIL post-snap; R=0.99 confident wrong measurement); Seven Nation Army (failing → worse). The CS.1.y.2 R-gate failure (Failed Approach #68) reappearing in Beat-This!-vs-Beat-This! form: tight cluster, wrong phase. |
| `2026-05-24T15-07-31Z` (round 3) | Matt's M7: "drift very much real across tracks"; "rarely snaps to the beat and does not follow downbeat." Cross-capture non-reproducibility confirmed on multiple tracks (Billie Jean -6/+79; SNA +88/-160; Get Lucky -109/-7; Everlong +44/-116; Superstition -181/+63 across captures). Pre-snap baseline also degraded: 1/10 PASS vs CS.1's 3/10. EMA drift bouncing 200-300 ms within steady-state tracks; HUMBLE only 43 % locked post-snap. |

**Root finding.** Beat This! on a 15 s tap is reproducible *within* a capture against a 25 s reference *on the same slice* (what redo.1 measured) — but is NOT reproducible *across* captures or *across* slice positions for several tracks. The "non-reproducibility across captures" failure mode that killed the 3-5 s windows in the original CS.1.y re-diagnosis is alive at 15 s on a subset of tracks. redo.1 made a measurement that did not cover the production case (the production case is "Beat This!@first-15-s-of-tap" compared to whatever the user perceives later, not "Beat This!@15 s of slice A vs Beat This!@25 s of the same slice").

**Also surfaced:** the pre-fix "approx now" baseline itself degraded across captures using identical cached grids — either `gridOnsetOffsetMs` seeding is non-deterministic across preps (the prep-time `GridOnsetCalibrator` is still onset-based — Failed Approach #68's root cause that we left in place at prep time), or the verifier's clock-offset estimate is noise-coupled, or there's an unrelated regression. The "approximately within ±130 ms" claim CS.1 made (and that the 2026-05-22 product-direction decision relied on) does not hold across captures.

**Pattern.** CS.1 → CS.1.y.1 → CS.1.y.2 → CS.1.y re-diag → CS.1.y.2-redo redo.1 → redo.2 → redo.3 round 1 fix → round 2 fix = **five fix increments on the same defect without perceptual convergence.** This is the Drift-Motes pattern (Failed Approach #58) at infrastructure scope. Per CLAUDE.md "stop and report instead of forging ahead" and "iteration converges only when each step integrates feedback into the model" — the model is wrong upstream, more fixes won't help.

**Status.** **BUG-017 stays Open** but its scope is now broader than the original cold-start grid-phase offset: the broader symptom is "beat-sync infrastructure is not perceptually aligned across the catalog" (Matt 2026-05-24). To be addressed by a beat-sync audit increment (analogous to Phase CA's DSP audit but scoped to the beat-sync wiring specifically — `GridOnsetCalibrator` prep-time seeding, `LiveBeatDriftTracker` EMA behaviour under wrong-phase grids, verifier clock-offset sensitivity, and whether the broader perceptual drift comes from one root cause or several). **No fix code until the audit produces a per-component verdict with empirical grounding.**

**Audit kickoff prompt:** `docs/prompts/BEAT_SYNC_AUDIT_KICKOFF.md` (next session).

### Addendum (Beat-Sync Audit deliverable, BSAudit, 2026-05-24)

The audit published as [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md`](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md). Read-only; no fix code. Per-component verdicts with empirical grounding from the four reference captures (`2026-05-22T16-57-36Z`, `2026-05-22T19-03-59Z`, `2026-05-23T02-39-54Z`, `2026-05-24T15-07-31Z`).

**Refined symptom statement.** The "beat-sync infrastructure is not perceptually aligned across the catalog" symptom (Matt 2026-05-24) decomposes into **two distinct defect classes acting simultaneously**:

1. **Systematic per-track phase offset on syncopated tracks** (BUG-017's original framing). The cold-start install path `cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0)` treats preview-clip timeline as track timeline; the `gridOnsetOffsetMs` seed (sub-bass-onset-based, prep-time — Failed Approach #68 still live in production at prep time) cannot measure preview-vs-track phase. Result: 7/10 tracks in cap1 carry per-track phase offsets ≤ ½-beat at the track's tempo (HUMBLE +338 ms; Money −128 ms). Static defect — same value every capture.
2. **Cross-capture variability of the verification reference** (new finding). Beat This! on a 25 s slice of live tap audio produces *different beat positions* on 5-6 of 10 tracks across captures of the same Spotify previews — the dominant finding behind the cap1→cap4 baseline degradation (3/10 PASS → 1/10 PASS) and the cap3→cap4 snap-drift divergence (≥85 ms on 6/10 tracks with the same fix). The CS.1.y.2-redo cycle's verifier-passing→M7-failing pattern is explained: verifier and M7 disagreed because the verifier's reference moved across captures. The redo.1 "10/10 viable at 15 s" measurement validated within-slice reproducibility, not the production case (cross-capture). Beat This!-on-tap is fine as a within-capture reference but is not a stable physical reference across captures.

**Ranked root-cause hypotheses (full evidence in [`BEAT_SYNC.md`](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md) §Ranked):**

| Rank | Hypothesis | Drives cross-capture variability | Drives systematic offset on syncopated tracks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Beat This!-on-tap not cross-capture reproducible (Component 5b) | **Dominant** | Small |
| 2 | Sub-bass onsets used as beat-phase reference in 3 places (Components 6, 1b, 3, 5a) | Small (<50 ms) | **Dominant** (per-track 100s of ms) |
| 3 | Cold-start install: preview-time as track-time (Components 1a/2) | None (static) | **Dominant** (BUG-017's original static defect) |
| 4 | Verifier clock-offset noise (Component 5a) | Small (±50-150 ms, bounded by `searchRadiusS`) | Small |
| 5 | `gridOnsetOffsetMs` non-determinism (Component 1b) | Small (≤30 ms on 3/10 tracks) | None |

**Per-component fix scope sketches** (none authorized for implementation; Matt sign-off required):

- **Component 1b** — Delete `GridOnsetCalibrator` from prep, or reframe its output as detection-latency only (not beat-phase). Removes one of three production uses of sub-bass onsets as a phase reference.
- **Component 2** — Document the structural limitation honestly: "approximately beat-synced from frame 1; exact phase recovered within ~20 s" (already the 2026-05-22 product-direction decision). Optionally add a `coldStart` lock-state distinction so presets don't accent-pulse on a known-suspect grid.
- **Component 3** — *Do not change.* The EMA does its designed job correctly; CS.1.y.2 and CS.1.y.2-redo both failed because they tried to extend it past its design envelope.
- **Component 5a** — One-line instrumentation: log `coarseS` + `offsetS - coarseS` per track in `ColdStartVerifier`; re-run on existing captures; close Hypothesis 4 with measurement.
- **Component 5b** — *Research-only.* Find or build a cross-capture-stable reference (full-tap Beat This! window, or human-tap ground truth). **Load-bearing pre-work for any future BUG-017 closeout** — no fix can claim convergence while the verification infrastructure cannot judge it reliably.
- **Component 6** — *Do not change the detector.* Retire its use as a phase reference at the call sites (Components 1b, 3, 5a); CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #68 generalizes from "the runtime fix" to "any use as a phase primitive."

**Open empirical questions surfaced as gaps** (not blocking this audit; would require small instrumentation increments):
- Q1 follow-up: re-run `GridOnsetCalibrator` cross-capture on archived preview audio to confirm whether the 11-30 ms seed variation on 3/10 tracks comes from preview-byte differences or from a hidden non-determinism in the calibrator.
- Q5: instrument verifier clock-offset refinement to characterise per-capture noise (≤1 hour instrumentation).
- Q6 follow-up: per-track sub-bass-onset-distance distribution against full-window Beat This! ground truth (1-2 hour offline analysis), if/when a stable ground truth exists.

**BUG-017 stays Open** with the refined symptom statement above. The next step is **Matt sign-off on direction** for the BSAudit-FU-* follow-up backlog ([`BEAT_SYNC.md`](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md) §Follow-up Backlog) — not another fix increment. **No new fix code until a Component 5b cross-capture-stable reference exists or a Component 2-style honest-limitation product framing is documented.**

### Addendum (BSAudit.2 — Path A falsified, 2026-05-24)

The BSAudit follow-up BSAudit-FU-5 split into Path A (Beat This!-on-tap reproducibility) and Path B (human-tap ground truth). BSAudit.2 implemented Path A as two `ColdStartVerifier` modes and ran them on the four reference captures. **Path A is empirically falsified — no 25 s slice configuration of Beat This!-on-tap is reproducible.** Full evidence in [`BEAT_SYNC.md` Addendum — BSAudit.2 (Path A) findings](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/BEAT_SYNC.md#addendum--bsaudit2-path-a-findings-2026-05-24).

**Findings.**
- **Within-capture position sensitivity:** for the same audio in the same capture, Beat This! on a 25 s slice produces different beat positions when the slice start moves by 10 s. 7 of 10 tracks fail by 100-410 ms phase spread across positions. Two qualitative behaviours: monotonic phase drift (Beat This! mis-estimating period — Get Lucky, Royals) and erratic large jumps (Beat This! locking to different metric interpretations — Billie Jean, Around the World).
- **Cross-capture instability:** 10 of 10 tracks differ by 100-322 ms in same-position 25 s Beat This! across the 4 captures. Even tracks that are within-capture-stable (Seven Nation Army, Everlong, HUMBLE) are cross-capture-unstable — HUMBLE within-capture-stable to ≤ 25 ms but cap4 reads −322 ms different from cap1 at the same playback-time.

**Implication.** A longer/stitched window cannot rescue this — Beat This! produces conflicting metric interpretations the model itself cannot reconcile. Path A is closed.

**Path B (human-tap reference) is now load-bearing** for any future BUG-017 fix-claim that depends on automated verification. The product-strategy fork is now:
1. **Build Path B** (small CLI + ~4 min of Matt's taps for the 10-track catalog + ~1 session of tooling). Unblocks future fix-claims with a stable ground truth.
2. **Accept the structural limit and document** (2026-05-22 "approximately synced immediately, locked within ~20 s" position becomes the canonical answer; recast `ColdStartVerifier` as within-capture-only).

The audit does not pick between these. Matt's call.

### Addendum (BSAudit.3 design + impl, 2026-05-24)

Matt picked **a third path** between BSAudit's options: a design-first re-architecture. [`docs/BPM_ANCHORED_PHASE_ACQUISITION_DESIGN_2026-05-24.md`](../BPM_ANCHORED_PHASE_ACQUISITION_DESIGN_2026-05-24.md) drops the "trust cached grid phase" + "snap to live Beat This! @ 15 s" approaches entirely; replaces them with **BPM-prior + broadband-peak phase acquisition + confidence-gated accents**. The premise: never claim phase at frame 1; anchor on the first broadband flux peak; accumulate confidence via an EMA against the BPM prior's predictions; only fire accents at amplitude proportional to confidence. Three sub-commits shipped 2026-05-24 (`efaf8cb4`, `13d0f456`, `30d032ea` — see `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-24-d]`). `GridOnsetCalibrator` retired entirely (Failed Approach #68 root cause removed from prep). Validation deferred to BSAudit.3.validate.

### Addendum (BSAudit.3.validate.1 + .2 — diagnostic infrastructure + historical baseline, 2026-05-25)

`[BSAudit.3.validate.1]` (`515f9b89`) added a new verifier mode `--accent-window-pass-rate` per the architecture's design §8 + §12: for each audible beat (Beat This! on raw_tap), did a `beatComposite` rising-edge fire within ±60 ms? Per-track verdict PASS-firing | PASS-degraded | FAIL; aggregate gate ≥ 90 % of catalog. CSV schema gained `accent_confidence` column. ColdStartVerifier --self-test went from 7/7 to 11/11.

`[BSAudit.3.validate.2]` (`cf83037c`) ran the new mode against the 3 available pre-impl reference captures (cap1 = `2026-05-22T16-57-36Z` was missing from disk; cap2/3/4 still present). All 30 pre-impl track samples landed PASS-firing at ≥ 95 % — the OLD architecture's raw un-gated `beatComposite` fired on every per-band onset, trivially covering each audible beat by accident of pop/rock kick-on-beat behaviour. See [`docs/diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_HISTORICAL_BASELINE_2026-05-25.md`](../diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_HISTORICAL_BASELINE_2026-05-25.md).

### Addendum (BSAudit.3.diag.1 — fresh-capture diagnostic + Failed Approach #69, 2026-05-25)

Matt produced a fresh post-impl capture at `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-25T15-20-49Z/` (same 10-track playlist, `PHOSPHENE_FULL_RAW_TAP=1`). The verifier ran against it: aggregate **FAIL — 40 % of 10 tracks pass** (2 PASS-firing, 2 PASS-degraded, 6 FAIL). `[BSAudit.3.diag.1]` (`346f7487`) extended the verifier with a per-track diagnostic block (first broadband peak time + residual, first accent fire + residual, confidence/lock-state timings, per-fire residual distribution) and produced the root-cause findings at [`docs/diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md`](../diagnostics/BSAUDIT_3_VALIDATE_3_DIAG_2026-05-25.md).

**Root cause (three structural findings, all empirically grounded):**

1. **Broadband-flux-as-phase-anchor is unsound.** 5 of 10 tracks anchored > 100 ms off the nearest audible beat (Billie Jean −212, ATW −231, SNA −291, Royals −516, B.O.B. −309). Consistently negative residuals indicate broadband flux fires on *pre-beat* content (pad swells, vocal entries, hi-hat lead-ins) — same shape as Failed Approach #68 at the broadband layer.
2. **Confidence accumulator does NOT back-pressure off-anchor lock.** HUMBLE (anchor −68 ms) reached confidence 0.9; Billie Jean (anchor −212 ms) reached 1.0. Design §9.1 mitigation falsified: periodic broadband content at quarter-note rates reinforces *any* phase that matches the period, not just on-beat. The accumulator can't distinguish "actually-on-beat reinforcement" from "any-periodic-content-at-the-period reinforcement."
3. **Verifier metric is gameable by accent over-firing.** Billie Jean: 25+ accent fires in 10 s vs 19 audible beats; per-fire median |residual| = 109 ms; metric still reads 95 % PASS-firing. "Any accent within ±60 ms of each beat" is trivially satisfied by accent over-firing.

This is **Failed Approach #58 iteration #6 territory at infrastructure scope** — six iterations on the same defect (CS.1 → CS.1.y.2 → CS.1.y re-diag → CS.1.y.2-redo r1+r2 → BSAudit.3.impl), each with a different mechanism, none converging on > 70 % of catalog. The common thread the iterations did not change is the upstream premise: *"there is some automated signal in the first ~3 s of tap audio that reliably tells us the audible beat phase of a novel track."* Six attempts empirically falsified that premise. **CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #69** captures the pattern; **CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract** captures the achievable contract.

### Resolution (Matt's Choice A decision, 2026-05-25)

**BUG-017 resolves against an accepted structural limit, not a fix.** Matt's framing of the decision:

> *"give up the marketing claim 'synced from frame 1,' accept 'musical from frame 1.' That's a smaller concession than it sounds because nobody's marketing copy depended on the stronger claim."*

The production cold-start architecture was retained as BSAudit.3.impl in this closeout. **AMENDED 2026-05-26:** the BSAudit.3.impl runtime was reverted on 2026-05-25 evening (`33cd57e9` / `6758a617` / `002b5f2b` / `35305b5e`); production is the pre-impl baseline (cached BeatGrid install via `MIRPipeline.setBeatGrid`, `LiveBeatDriftTracker` pre-impl form, `GridOnsetCalibrator` reinstated, no `accentConfidence` field, ungated beat accents). What's retired: the original Phase CS bar ("±50 ms / 90 % from frame 1"). The structural limit holds independent of the runtime in place. The architecture's actual contract is what CLAUDE.md §Cold-Start Phase Contract documents (rewritten 2026-05-26 to describe the post-revert state).

Future work in this space requires a fundamentally different premise (human-tap reference per BSAudit-FU-5 Path B, full-track local-file analysis, manual per-track calibration UX) — not another short-window signal. See Failed Approach #69's discriminator.

### BUG-015 — `applyLiveUpdate(...)` has zero production call sites; Orchestrator live-adaptation pipeline is dead at runtime

**Severity:** P1 (load-bearing product claim — "the AI Orchestrator has planned the entire visual session and adapts as the music unfolds" per CLAUDE.md top — the adaptation half does not run).
**Domain tag:** `pipeline-wiring`
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-21.** The App-layer wire is in place (`runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)` calls `applyLiveUpdate(...)` from the analysis-queue tick at ~3 Hz; sources `liveBoundary` from `mirPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction`); the regression test (`OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests.swift`) passes; the Orchestrator engine suite (including the three QR.2 / D-080 cooldown tests) stays green. Verification criterion #2 confirmed by Matt's `2026-05-21T14-19-32Z` session capture: `session.log` shows two `Orchestrator: wire active` lines (one at 8.2 s pre-first-track-change in warmup state, one at 0.0 s elapsed on the new track after `mir.reset()`), proving the wire fires AND the per-track diagnostic latch resets correctly on track change.
**Introduced:** Surfaced 2026-05-20 by [CA.4 Orchestrator audit](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md). The root condition pre-dates this filing; `git log -p PhospheneApp/VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift -- *applyLiveUpdate*` will narrow when (or whether) the call site was ever added. Phase 4.5 (Live Adaptation) and 4.6 (Ad-Hoc Reactive Mode) both shipped ✅ at the Orchestrator-module surface (LiveAdapter / ReactiveOrchestrator implementations + unit tests + the `applyLiveUpdate(...)` entry point method); the App-layer audio-callback invocation of `applyLiveUpdate(...)` was never wired until 2026-05-21.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-21 in three commits:
- `b3f1efd9` — wire: `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)` + regression test `OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests.swift` + lock-guarded `liveTrackPlanIndex` / `lastClassifiedMood` fields + pbxproj registration.
- `5efc6a90` — once-per-track `Orchestrator: wire active` diagnostic dual-writing to `session.log` (via `SessionRecorder.log`) and the unified log (via `os.Logger`). Closes the verification-criterion-#2 doc-vs-runtime gap (existing Orchestrator log lines never reached `session.log`).
- `<commit 3 hash>` — Status flip + RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md final entry.

Validation evidence (Matt's `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-21T14-19-32Z/session.log` lines 6 and 11):

```
[2026-05-21T14:19:40Z] Orchestrator: wire active (mode=reactive, planIdx=—, elapsedTrackTime=8.2s)
[2026-05-21T14:19:41Z] Orchestrator: wire active (mode=reactive, planIdx=—, elapsedTrackTime=0.0s)
```

7 519 frames / 23 stem dumps in that session confirm the full audio path is alive; the once-per-track latch is verified (exactly one diagnostic line per track, no per-frame noise).

**Expected behavior.** During session-mode playback: planned transitions reschedule against live structural boundaries when the deviation exceeds 5 s; mood overrides fire mid-track when measured valence/arousal diverges from pre-analyzed mood by > 0.4 (with the 30 s per-track cooldown enforced by `DefaultLiveAdapter.cooldownAdaptation(...)` per D-080 rule 3); the L diagnostic-hold / capture-mode grace window / `wait_for_completion_event` suppression machinery actually has something to suppress. During ad-hoc playback after the 15 s listening window: `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator.evaluate(...)` returns preset suggestions; the 60 s reactive cooldown in `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator` rate-limits them; switches land at structural boundaries or score-gap thresholds per D-036.

**Actual behavior.** Neither path runs. `liveAdapter.adapt(...)` and `reactiveOrchestrator.evaluate(...)` are exercised only by unit tests. The session-log shows no `Orchestrator:`, `LiveAdapter:`, or `Reactive` log lines from the live-adaptation event family across any real-music capture.

**Reproduction steps.**

1. Run any session (Spotify-prepared or ad-hoc) for ≥ 30 seconds.
2. Open `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<ts>/session.log`.
3. Observe: no `LiveAdapter: boundary rescheduled`, `LiveAdapter: preset override`, or `Reactive [...]: '...' replaces` lines.
4. Confirm absence via grep:
   ```
   $ grep -rn "applyLiveUpdate" PhospheneApp PhospheneEngine --include="*.swift"
   ```
   Returns 1 declaration (`VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:166`), 4 doc-comment / commentary references in unrelated files, 1 test reference. **Zero actual invocations.**

**Minimum reproducer.** Any session. The bug is structural — no audio-driven path invokes `applyLiveUpdate(...)`.

**Session artifacts.** Any `session.log` from a recent capture (the log family that's missing is the load-bearing artifact — its absence is the symptom).

**Suspected failure class.** `pipeline-wiring` per `docs/QUALITY/DEFECT_TAXONOMY.md`. The Orchestrator-module surface is complete and correct; the App-layer invocation site was never added (or was removed during a refactor — likely candidates: `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift` analysis-queue tick, or a Combine sink on the MIR feature publisher).

**Verification criteria (write before the fix).**

- [ ] Automated: a new integration test exercises a 30 s reactive session against synthetic FeatureVectors (or a recorded capture) and asserts at least one `reactiveOrchestrator.evaluate(...)` invocation happens after the 15 s listening window. Test fixture: any real-music preview clip; or the SoakTestHarness localFile mode driving 30 s of audio.
- [ ] Manual: a real-music session capture's `session.log` shows at least one entry from the `Orchestrator:` `LiveAdapter:` or `Reactive` log-line family during a > 1 minute playback. (Today: zero such lines.)
- [ ] Regression: the 30 s per-track mood-override cooldown enforced by `DefaultLiveAdapter.cooldownAdaptation(...)` (verified at `LiveAdapter.swift:362-381` per CA.4) is preserved post-fix — the fix MUST NOT bypass the cooldown machinery. A test that fires N consecutive mood-divergence events at < 30 s intervals on the same track asserts ≤ 1 override is applied.

**Fix scope.** Multi-increment per the CLAUDE.md Defect Handling Protocol (this is P1, not P0; the trivial-collapse exemption requires Matt's explicit approval and the fix is unlikely to be < 5 lines).

1. **Instrumentation (this BUG entry establishes the read; no separate instrumentation increment needed — the grep evidence is reproducible from any source checkout).**
2. **Diagnosis** — locate the intended call site. Two candidate sites surfaced by the audit:
   - (a) `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift` analysis-queue tick at a 1–10 Hz cadence (per-track cooldown is already enforced inside `DefaultLiveAdapter`; the cadence just needs to be low enough that the cooldown's 30 s window dominates).
   - (b) A Combine sink on `MIRPipeline`'s feature publisher (lower-frequency, naturally bound to feature updates).
3. **Fix** — implement the chosen wire. The `boundary` argument should source from either `pipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` (real per-frame; would also resolve CA.1-FU-1 option (b)) or `StructuralPrediction.none` sentinel (simpler; pairs with CA.1-FU-1 option (a) gating the per-frame chain to prep-time only).
4. **Validation** — run the verification criteria above; produce a session-log capture showing the live-adaptation event family is firing.
5. **Release notes** — update `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md`; mark Resolved in this entry with the commit hash.

**Related.** CA.4 audit deliverable (this filing); CA.1-FU-1 (re-scoped — see [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md` §Resolution-of-CA.1-runtime-production-orphan-re-evaluation](../CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md)); CA.4-FU-1 (demote dead `DefaultLiveAdapter.transitionPolicy` field; natural to bundle with the BUG-015 fix); D-035 (live adaptation design — implementation faithful, wiring absent); D-036 (reactive orchestrator design — same); D-080 (QR.2 mood-override cooldown + reactive `liveStemFeatures` wiring — both unreachable until BUG-015 lands); BUG-001 (`Money 7/4 stays REACTIVE on live path` — different concept; BUG-001's "REACTIVE" refers to the SpectralCartograph mode label / DSP-side lock state, NOT the Orchestrator's reactive mode).

**Why P1 not P0.** P0 is "session-blocking" per the taxonomy; the product still plays sessions and the static plan does work (`DefaultSessionPlanner.plan(...)` and the canonical-identity wiring at `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:131` per BUG-006.2 are both reachable). What's broken is the adaptation half — the product runs as a static playlist with no live response to detected boundaries or mood shifts. That's a significant degradation of the product's stated value but not a session-blocker.

**Notes on existing tests.** The audit's grep confirmed that `LiveAdapterTests`, `ReactiveOrchestratorTests`, `DiagnosticHoldTests`, and the other 13 Orchestrator test files exercise `liveAdapter.adapt(...)` / `reactiveOrchestrator.evaluate(...)` directly with fabricated inputs. The tests pass. They do not catch BUG-015 because they bypass the App-layer entry point. The verification criterion #1 above closes that test/prod gap.

### BUG-011 — Arachne over Tier 2 frame budget at the median

**Severity:** P2 (visible degradation under specific conditions: Arachne active on Tier 2 hardware. Median frame already at the FrameBudgetManager downshift threshold; 53% of frames over budget. Not a session-blocker — drop rate at the 32 ms threshold is 1.46%, so most frames complete inside one refresh — but the visual will feel laggy when Arachne is selected, and the governor will downshift quality more aggressively than intended.)
**Domain tag:** perf
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-12 (closure commit pending) — closed against relaxed drops-only criteria after the 37,821-frame production re-capture confirmed p95 = 15.303 ms (1.3 ms over the 14 ms gate, definitively not noise) but drops at 0.02 % (400× under the 8 % target).** The L1+L2+L3 worst-case-spike tuning (2026-05-10) plus the L5 cheap-cleanup tranche (2026-05-12) reduced p95 from 26.607 → 15.303 ms (−11 ms) and drops from 1.46 % → 0.02 % (73× reduction). The remaining 1.3 ms p95 gap is structural always-on cost on M2 Pro; closing it would require L5.1 WORLD half-rate refresh (1-2 sessions of engineering for ~1.5-2 ms savings that the drops data says aren't user-perceptible). Matt's 2026-05-12 closure decision: accept p95 = 15.3 ms on M2 Pro as a known limitation of borderline Tier 2 hardware, close on the drops result. See "2026-05-12 closure rationale" section below.
**Introduced:** Surfaced 2026-05-08 by DM.3a per-frame perf capture in session `2026-05-08T22-01-07Z`. Likely accumulated across the V.7.7B → V.7.7C → V.7.7D → V.7.7C.5 sequence of staged-composition + 3D-spider + atmospheric-reframe additions. No single increment "introduced" it; the cost grew incrementally and was never measured against the full-pipeline budget until now.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-12 against relaxed drops-only criteria. Closure commit follows this doc edit.

### Expected behavior

Arachne running on Tier 2 hardware (M3+, or M2 Pro at the lower end) should hold p95 frame_gpu_ms ≤ 14 ms — the FrameBudgetManager Tier 2 downshift threshold. p50 should sit well under that (target ≤ 8 ms, the 50% headroom over 16.6 ms refresh), with drops (frames > 32 ms) under 8% over a 60 s representative window.

### Actual behavior

Measured on M2 Pro under real Spotify-prepared playback (Love Rehab / So What / Limit To Your Love), Arachne window of 4,579 frames (~77 s):

- p50 = **14.120 ms** (already at the downshift threshold at the median)
- p95 = **26.607 ms**
- p99 = **32.743 ms** (right at the drop threshold)
- max = 36.072 ms
- 52.98% of frames over 14 ms
- 1.46% drops (> 32 ms)

Drift Motes in the same session sat at p50 = 1.225 / p95 = 1.321 / drops = 0.39% — proving the measurement infrastructure and the rest of the pipeline are healthy. The cost is concentrated in Arachne specifically.

### Reproduction steps

1. Build the app: `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build`
2. Start an ad-hoc session with a real playlist (Spotify-prepared works; reference fixtures: Love Rehab and So What).
3. Pin Arachne via `⌘[`/`⌘]` and hold `L` (diagnostic-preset-locked).
4. Run for ≥ 60 s.
5. End the session.
6. Parse `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<timestamp>/features.csv` — `frame_gpu_ms` column gives per-frame GPU timing; compute p50 / p95 / p99 and drop count (`frame_gpu_ms > 32`).

**Minimum reproducer:** any track with non-trivial bass + mid energy on Tier 2 hardware. The cost is composition-driven (canvas-filling silk + 3D SDF spider + Snell's-law refraction + 12 Hz vibration UV jitter), not audio-content-driven, so any moderately energetic track should reproduce.

### Suspected failure class

`render-state` (cumulative cost across staged-composition layers; not a single bug, but the architectural envelope of the V.7.7C.5 atmospheric reframe + V.7.7D 3D spider + V.7.7C Snell's-law drops is heavier than the 1.6 ms Tier 2 budget allows on lower-tier silicon).

**Evidence for this class:** Composition-driven cost (independent of audio content); reproduces consistently in a 4,579-frame window with p50 already at the downshift threshold; not localised to any single shader function (the COMPOSITE fragment runs ray-marched 3D SDF + drop refraction + per-pixel vibration UV jitter, all unconditionally).

---

### Diagnosis notes

The most expensive blocks in `arachne_composite_fragment`, in rough cost order:

1. **3D SDF ray-march of the spider** (V.7.7D) — 32-step adaptive sphere trace + tetrahedron-trick normal estimation, gated to a 0.15 UV patch around the spider's UV anchor. Patch gate keeps cost off-frame, but the patch is always present (spider is always rendered). Even outside listening pose, the body + 8 IK legs evaluate per-pixel inside the patch.
2. **Snell's-law drop refraction** (V.7.7C) — `worldTex.sample(refractedUV)` per drop pixel; sample count scales with drop coverage. After V.7.7C.5's canvas-filling foreground, drop coverage is much larger than V.7.7C measured at.
3. **Polygon-aware spoke clipping + chord-spiral evaluation** (V.7.7C.3) — `arachneEvalWeb` ray-clips spoke tips against the polygon perimeter and evaluates the segment SDF for each chord. Cost scales with chord count (`progress × N_RINGS × nSpk`).
4. **WORLD sampling + ambient + rim** (V.7.7B/C.5) — single `worldTex.sample` plus the V.7.7C.5 §4.2 fog/shaft contribution. Comparatively cheap.
5. **12 Hz vibration UV jitter** (V.7.7D §8.2) — coherent 8×8 phase quantization via `hash_f01_2`; cheap per-pixel.

Likely candidates for the first tuning lever:
- **Reduce ray-march step count** on the spider (32 → 24, or adaptive based on patch coverage).
- **Skip drop refraction outside a smaller drop coverage gate** — refraction sampling for fully-occluded drops is wasted work.
- **Defer spider ray-march when listening-pose blend is < 0.05** AND spider state is `.idle` — the spider visually contributes nothing in those frames.
- **DeviceTier-aware fallback path** — accept that V.7.7C.5's full feature set is a Tier-2-and-up target; downshift the spider to 2D silhouette on Tier 1 (this is what V.7.5 originally shipped pre-V.7.7D).

### 2026-05-10 tuning pass (L1 + L2 + L3 landed)

Three shader-side levers pulled in three separate commits, each with golden-hash + visual + test verification at each step. SOAK kernel-cost benchmark added in the fourth commit as the in-tree regression gate.

| commit | lever | change | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `082164c7` | **L1** spider ray-march steps | `maxSteps = 32 → 24` (Arachne.metal:~1640) | Worst-case loop reduction for miss-rays inside the 0.15 UV spider patch (~226×226 px @ 1080p ≈ 51k pixels). On-hit rays unaffected (sphere trace early-exits at hitEps). |
| `1643ee24` | **L2** drop refraction coverage gate | `wr.dropCov > 0.01 → > 0.5` (both anchor + dead-pool sites) | Skips the per-pixel `worldTex.sample(refractedUV)` + smoothstep+pow chain on the anti-aliased rim band of every drop. Drops render with a clean visible core; rim pixels fall through to the silk-strand colour underneath. |
| `96b2c288` | **L3** spider dispatch gate | `spider.blend > 0.01 → > 0.05` (dispatch site only, not overlay mix) | Skips the patch ray-march during the spider's fade-in/fade-out tail (blend ramping below 5 % opacity is below perceptual threshold). `listenLiftEMA` not plumbed to GPU per D-094, so gate uses `spider.blend` alone — listening pose triggers via the existing path with at most a 1-frame lag. |
| `bd213856` | **SOAK gate** | `shortRunArachneComposite` benchmark added | Kernel-only SOAK_TESTS=1 benchmark. Renders COMPOSITE fragment to 1920×1080 offscreen with spider forced ON (worst case). p95 ≤ 16 ms loose gate. |

**SOAK measurement on M2 Pro (this session, post-L1+L2+L3, spider forced ON every frame):**

```
┌─ ArachneCompositeKernelCost [Tier 2, 1920×1080, spider forced ON] ─
│ frames=1800  mean=12.903ms
│ p50=12.724ms  p95=14.458ms  p99=15.169ms
│ kernel overruns (>14ms)=172 of 1800
└────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Run-to-run variance ≈ 0.1 ms (two runs: p95 = 14.578 / 14.458). The 16 ms SOAK gate sits ~10 % above the worst-case fixture and well below the pre-tuning ~26 ms baseline a lever-revert would restore.

**Calibration finding worth preserving:** Arachne is fragment-only (no compute pre-pass), so kernel ≈ full-pipeline — there's a small (~0.5–1 ms) overhead from the WORLD pass + drawable presentation + triple-buffering coordination, but the dominant cost is the fragment shader. The initial 5 ms SOAK gate suggested by the BUG-011 prompt was anchored on a kernel:full-pipeline ratio borrowed from a compute-heavy preset (since retired — D-102) and was rebased to 16 ms based on the in-session measurement.

**Why "Open" not "Resolved":** the SOAK forces spider ON every frame (worst case); production has spider idle ~75 % of the time, so real-music p95 will land lower. But the SOAK kernel measurement also doesn't include WORLD pass + drawable cost. Net production p95 is *probably* below 14 ms on M2 Pro but the closure gate is the actual production capture per Verification criteria below — see the DM.3 perf-capture procedure.

L4 (DeviceTier-aware fallback) explicitly NOT pulled — the prompt requires Matt's call before introducing a Tier-1 silhouette fallback. If Matt's real-music capture shows post-L1+L2+L3 p95 still > 14 ms on M2 Pro, L4 is the next escalation; otherwise L4 is unnecessary and the current state closes BUG-011.

---

### 2026-05-12 round-8 follow-up (BEHAVIOURAL, not perf)

The four items from Matt's session `2026-05-11T23-18-42Z` directive landed in three commits on `main` 2026-05-12 (`ceb35340`, `0756a9ef`, `04855e26`; pushed). They share the BUG-011 ID for convenience because the source prompt was titled BUG-011, but they are **operationally distinct from the perf tuning above**: none of them touches frame-budget headroom. The original perf closure gate (Matt's M2 Pro real-music perf capture) is unchanged. See `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` `[dev-2026-05-12-c]` for the full landed-work narrative; the summary lives here so a future session inspecting this entry sees the complete picture.

| Item | Description | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| **4** | 8 % build speedup. `ArachneBuildState.frameDurationSeconds 3.0 → 2.775`; `radialDurationSeconds 1.5 → 1.389`; new `spiralChordsPerBeat = 3.24` advance rate via `spiralChordAccumulator: Float` (fractional residual). Median build cycle ~100 s → ~92 s. | `ceb35340` |
| **1** | Silent-state build pause. New `stemEnergySilenceThreshold = 0.02`; `advanceBuildState` zeros `effectiveDt` when sum of four AGC-normalised stem energies < 0.02. Arachne no longer constructs during prep / silence / source-app paused. Two new gate-regression tests. | `0756a9ef` |
| **3** | Completion-gated transitions. New `PresetDescriptor.waitForCompletionEvent: Bool` (JSON `wait_for_completion_event`, default false). When true, `maxDuration(forSection:)` returns `.infinity` and `applyLiveUpdate` strips mood-derived overrides. Arachne JSON flips on. Existing `wirePresetCompletionSubscription` path delivers the transition trigger. Section-boundary cap unchanged (known limitation). | `04855e26` |
| **2** | "Spokes-below-orb" diagnosis (no code). Frame-extraction from session `T23-18-42Z` `video.mp4` showed every Arachne window in that session caught the build mid-radial-phase. Round-7's geometry was fine; the windows were too short for the build to reach `.stable`. Item 3 structurally resolves this. | (no commit) |

**Why this is "follow-up" not "closure":** the round-8 commits address user-facing problems Matt observed in production (web building during silence; orchestrator transitioning Arachne at ~50 s ignoring the round-7 `duration: 150` bump; build too slow; partial-radial frames misread as a geometry bug). They do not touch the Tier 2 frame-budget headroom that defines BUG-011 the **perf** issue. The perf closure gate documented in Verification criteria below — Matt's M2 Pro real-music perf capture — is still the load-bearing close condition. Round-8 does have one upstream effect on perf measurement: with `wait_for_completion_event: true`, Arachne windows are now ≥ 92 s instead of 47-64 s. When Matt runs the perf capture, that means each Arachne window will contain more frames and produce more statistically stable p50/p95 numbers (the previous numbers from 4,579-frame windows were already statistically reasonable; the new windows will be cleaner).

### 2026-05-12 production capture (post-round-8, post-L1+L2+L3)

**Session:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-12T18-19-31Z`
**Hardware:** Apple M2 Pro (Mac mini), macOS 26.4.1.
**Build:** post-round-8 `7b5b1f43` (CLAUDE.md doc commit; all three round-8 code commits in tree).
**Procedure:** Followed BUG-011 Reproduction steps. Spotify-prepared playlist; `L` engaged at session start; `⌘[`/`⌘]` cycled to Arachne; `wait_for_completion_event: true` + `diagnosticPresetLocked` kept Arachne pinned for the full session window after the initial Waveform → Arachne transition at engine time 3 s. No mid-session preset changes.

| metric | this capture | post-tuning target | pre-tuning baseline (2026-05-08) | Δ from baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frames | 14,152 (≈ 7.9 min) | ≥ 60 s | 4,579 (≈ 77 s) | 3.1× sample |
| **p50** | 13.649 ms | ≤ 8 ms | 14.120 ms | −0.5 ms (essentially unchanged) |
| **p95** | **16.068 ms** ← over budget by 2 ms | **≤ 14 ms** | 26.607 ms | **−10.5 ms** |
| p99 | 29.602 ms | — | 32.743 ms | −3.1 ms |
| max | 57.106 ms | — | 36.072 ms | +21 ms (long tail; see note below) |
| > 14 ms | 5,775 / 14,152 (40.8 %) | — | 52.98 % | −12 pp |
| drops (> 32 ms) | 94 / 14,152 (**0.7 %**) | ≤ 8 % | 1.46 % | comfortably under target |

**Diagnosis:** L1+L2+L3 worked where they were aimed — p95 dropped 10.5 ms, drops halved. Each lever attacked a worst-case spike (spider ray-march max-steps; drop refraction coverage gate; spider dispatch blend threshold). What didn't move is the **median** — 14.120 → 13.649 ms is within run-to-run variance. The post-tuning bottleneck is therefore **always-on per-frame cost**, not worst-case tails. p50 = 13.6 ms means most frames pay ≈ 14 ms of GPU time *before* any conditional work fires:

- WORLD pass (sky gradient + ambient fog + 1-2 god-rays + dust motes — always rendered into the offscreen WORLD texture every frame)
- COMPOSITE always-on work — silk strand SDF evaluation per pixel, chord segment evaluation, polygon ray-clip, mood palette lookup, 12 Hz vibration UV jitter applied to every pixel of the frame
- Drop accumulator pool loop fires per pixel even when the per-pixel drop coverage is below threshold

The p99 (29.6 ms) and max (57.1 ms) tails are heavier than the pre-tuning capture because the new capture is 3× longer (more chance to hit GC / scheduler / OS background spikes) and because the post-round-8 build cycle is ~92 s — long enough that the COMPOSITE pass evaluates the full ~441-chord spiral at peak, where pre-round-8 windows truncated before the spiral phase peaked. Neither tail crosses the 8 % drop threshold — drops are at 0.7 %, well under.

**This is not a closure under the existing criteria** (p95 ≤ 14 ms, p50 ≤ 8 ms both fail). Drops alone (0.7 % ≤ 8 %) would pass.

---

### 2026-05-12 L5 cheap-cleanup tranche (SOAK kernel: p95 14.458 → 12.557 ms)

**Trigger.** Matt asked whether drop-related processing could be retired given that dewdrops were removed in commit `3f6126e0`. Investigation surfaced three categories of dead per-pixel work still running:

1. **`ArachneBuildState.spiralChordBirthTimes: [Float]`** — CPU-side array allocated, cleared, and `.append()`-ed every rising-edge beat × N chord advances. Originally tracked per-chord ages for drop-accretion timing; with drops retired, never read in production. Only consumer was the `dropAccretionAgesChordsCorrectly` test (also retired with the field). Cheap on its own (CPU array operation per beat) but pure dead weight.
2. **`ArachneWebResult.strandTangent` field + tangent-decision logic** — `arachneEvalWeb` computed `result.strandTangent = (closer-of-spoke-vs-chord) ? bestSpokeTangent2D : spirTangent2D` per pixel, then both consumer sites in `arachne_composite_fragment` read it into `tang2D` and immediately `(void)tang2D;`-cast it. The tangent was a Marschner BRDF input demoted in V.7.9; both call sites had been carrying the dead-store since. **Per-pixel dead work.**
3. **Dust-mote `fbm4` early-out** — `drawWorld()` computed `fbm4(driftUV, 0.31)` per pixel, then multiplied by `moteCone = saturate(beamMax * 2.5)`. For pixels outside any shaft cone (`beamMax < ~0.004`, typically ~70-80 % of frame at usual mood values), the multiplier collapsed to ~0 but the 4-octave Perlin call had already happened. Gated the block on `if (beamMax > 0.01)`.

**SOAK kernel-cost benchmark measurement (M2 Pro, 1920×1080, spider forced ON, 1800 frames):**

| metric | pre-cleanup (2026-05-10 baseline) | post-cleanup (this session) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| p50 | 12.724 ms | 11.313 ms | **−1.4 ms** |
| p95 | 14.458 ms | 12.557 ms | **−1.9 ms** |
| p99 | 15.169 ms | 13.178 ms | −2.0 ms |
| mean | 12.903 ms | 11.444 ms | −1.5 ms |
| kernel overruns (>14 ms) | 172 / 1800 (9.6 %) | **1 / 1800 (0.06 %)** | −171 frames |

Run-to-run variance ≈ 0.1 ms (the SOAK gate is 16 ms p95; post-cleanup p95 sits 3.4 ms inside the gate).

**Projection to production p95.** The first production capture (2026-05-12T18-19-31Z) measured p95 = 16.068 ms in real-music conditions; SOAK measured p95 = 14.458 ms in worst-case-spider conditions before this cleanup. The SOAK ↔ production gap was ~+1.6 ms (production runs longer with more OS-scheduler interference) at the previous baseline. Applying the same gap to post-cleanup SOAK (12.557 ms) projects **production p95 ≈ 14.1 ms** — basically at the 14 ms target, within run-to-run noise. **Final closure requires Matt's re-capture** on real music to confirm.

**No visual regression.** Items 1 + 2 are pure dead-code removal; item 3 is an early-out gate at a threshold (`beamMax > 0.01`) where the masked contribution is already ~0 — semantics-preserving up to floating-point. All 43 targeted Arachne tests green; all golden hashes unchanged. App build clean. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files.

### 2026-05-12 production re-capture (post-cheap-cleanup)

**Session:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-12T20-30-28Z`
**Hardware:** Apple M2 Pro (Mac mini), macOS 26.4.1.
**Build:** `ef74ce69` (L5 cheap-cleanup tranche).
**Procedure:** Same as the prior production capture, but 21 minutes of pinned Arachne (`L` + `⌘[`/`⌘]`, single Waveform → Arachne transition at 4 s, 37,821 frames). Sample size is 2.7× the prior capture — variance hypothesis can be definitively ruled out.

| metric | re-capture (37,821 frames) | prior production (14,152 frames) | SOAK projection | gap from target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| p50 | 13.708 ms | 13.649 ms | — | structurally above 8 ms target |
| **p95** | **15.303 ms** | 16.068 ms | ~14.1 ms | 1.3 ms over 14 ms gate |
| p99 | 17.462 ms | 29.602 ms | — | dramatic tail improvement |
| max | 34.457 ms | 57.106 ms | — | dramatic tail improvement |
| > 14 ms | 40.8 % | 40.8 % | — | unchanged |
| **drops (>32 ms)** | **0.02 % (8 / 37,821)** | 0.7 % | — | **400× under 8 % target** |

**SOAK over-projected by ~1.2 ms.** Projected production p95 was ~14.1 ms; measured 15.303 ms. Reasons: (a) the dust-mote `fbm4` early-out lives in `drawWorld()` (WORLD pass) but the SOAK harness `shortRunArachneComposite` runs the COMPOSITE fragment only, so item 3's saving was never reflected in SOAK; (b) SOAK runs spider-forced-ON every frame which over-represents the strand-tangent retirement's win (production has spider idle ~75 % of the time); (c) production has WORLD pass + drawable presentation + OS-scheduler overhead (~+1.6-2.8 ms SOAK ↔ production gap depending on the run). The cleanup tranche helped production by ~0.8 ms (16.068 → 15.303 ms) — real but smaller than SOAK's −1.9 ms suggested.

**Tail spikes essentially eliminated.** p99 dropped 29.602 → 17.462 ms (−12 ms); max dropped 57.106 → 34.457 ms (−23 ms); drops fell 73× (1.46 % → 0.02 %). The L1+L2+L3 worst-case-spike levers compounded with the L5 cheap-cleanup to produce a much smoother frame-time distribution.

**21-minute Arachne window incidentally validated round-8 work.** Orchestrator transitioned Waveform → Arachne at 4 s and never left Arachne for the rest of the session. `wait_for_completion_event: true` + `L`-locked behaving exactly as designed across 21 minutes of continuous playback. No spurious mood-overrides, no spurious section-boundary transitions.

---

### 2026-05-12 closure rationale (Matt's decision: Option 2 — Accept with drops-only criteria)

**Closure path chosen.** Matt 2026-05-12: "path 2" (Accept). BUG-011 closes against relaxed drops-only criteria; the p95 ≤ 14 ms and p50 ≤ 8 ms gates are NOT met but the drops gate (≤ 8 %) is met overwhelmingly (0.02 %, 400× under target).

**Rationale.** The drops result is the user-perceptible metric — a frame > 32 ms is dropped by the compositor and visible as judder. p95 = 15.303 ms means 5 % of frames sit ~1-2 ms above the design budget, but they still complete within ~16-17 ms (at or within one refresh window). The `FrameBudgetManager`'s 14 ms downshift threshold was originally calibrated against the 60 fps refresh budget assuming downshift would prevent visible drops; in practice we're hitting essentially zero drops at p95 = 15.3 ms on M2 Pro. The 14 ms threshold is more aggressive than the actual visual impact requires for this preset/hardware combination.

**Architecture-contract context.** The architecture contract specifies M3+ as Tier 2; M2 Pro is borderline (M2 Pro is "Tier 1.5" in practice — Apple Silicon M2-family with Pro / Max variants that have more cores but the same per-core compute envelope as base M2). Accepting "p95 = 15.3 ms on borderline silicon" is consistent with the contract's spirit. The p95 ≤ 14 ms target stays as the design goal for actual Tier 2 (M3+) hardware; M2 Pro is documented as a known limitation.

**Known limitation to track going forward:** Arachne running on M2 Pro will trip the `FrameBudgetManager` p95 > 14 ms threshold ~5 % of the time, which means the governor may downshift quality more aggressively than designed (potentially toggling off SSGI etc. mid-segment when other presets are active near Arachne windows). This is acceptable on borderline hardware; M3+ silicon should not see this behaviour. **If a future preset addition or shader change eats into the headroom and produces visible drops on M3+ too, L5.1 (WORLD half-rate refresh) is the next escalation** — the cheap-cleanup tranche already retired the structural redundancies the L5 framing was scoped to address, so L5.1 (half-rate WORLD cache) is the only remaining un-pulled lever.

**What's NOT in scope for closure.** L5.1, L4 (M2 Pro → Tier 1 for Arachne), and M3+ measurement are all deferred. They become candidates for a new BUG-XXX entry if Arachne perf regresses on actual Tier 2 silicon in the future, or if a future preset increment eats meaningfully into Arachne's M2 Pro headroom.

**V.7.10 Arachne cert review unblocked.** The cert-review increment had been gated on BUG-011 closure; closure removes the gate. V.7.10 is now eligible to run when Matt schedules it.

---

### ~~Escalation options (Matt to decide)~~ — settled 2026-05-12

**Closure decision: Option 2 (Accept).** Sections below kept for historical reference; the three paths were live until Matt's 2026-05-12 closure decision. If a future regression reopens the perf gap and the cheap-cleanup tranche isn't enough on its own, L5.1 (WORLD half-rate refresh) is the recommended next move.

#### Option A — L5: attack always-on cost (cheap-cleanup tranche LANDED 2026-05-12; LIKELY ALREADY CLOSED)

**Update 2026-05-12.** Cheap-cleanup tranche landed before either of the larger sub-levers below was needed (see "2026-05-12 L5 cheap-cleanup tranche" section above). SOAK kernel p95 dropped 14.458 → 12.557 ms (−1.9 ms); projected production p95 ≈ 14.1 ms — at the gate, within run-to-run noise. **Awaiting Matt's M2 Pro re-capture** to confirm closure. If the re-capture closes p95 ≤ 14 ms, BUG-011 closes and L5.1 / L5.2 below are NOT needed.

If the re-capture still misses p95 ≤ 14 ms (within run-to-run noise: anywhere 13.5–14.5 ms is effectively at the gate), the larger candidate sub-levers remain:

- **L5.1 WORLD pass cached refresh.** Render WORLD at 30 fps (every other frame) and sample the cached texture in between. The WORLD content is mostly slow-moving (sky gradient + ambient fog + god-rays driven by `f.mid_att_rel`); only the dust-mote field moves at audio rate, and that's now early-out-gated by the cheap-cleanup tranche. Estimated saving: 1.5–2 ms on COMPOSITE-only frames. Risk: visible shimmer if cache invalidation logic is wrong on mood transitions; needs tested fallback.
- **L5.2 Drop pool early-out.** **Retired** — the drop pool itself was removed in commit `3f6126e0` (drops retired during web construction); no per-pixel loop remains to prune. The "drop pool" referenced in earlier L5 framing no longer exists; the cheap-cleanup tranche found and removed the last per-pixel residue.

Scope for L5.1 if needed: 1-2 sessions for design + implementation + golden-hash regen + manual smoke. Would need a new `D-XXX` decision entry ("Arachne WORLD half-rate refresh, Tier 2 always-on cost reduction") before implementation.

#### Option B — L4: reclassify M2 Pro as Tier 1 for Arachne specifically

The architecture contract specifies M3+ as Tier 2; M2 Pro is borderline. L4 as originally scoped is "Tier 1 gets the V.7.5 silhouette spider." Re-classifying M2 Pro as Tier 1 for Arachne would:

- Restore V.7.5's 2D silhouette spider on M2 Pro (V.7.7D's 3D SDF spider only on M3+).
- Probably bring M2 Pro p95 well under 14 ms (the spider ray-march is the biggest worst-case cost, even after L1's max-steps reduction).
- Cost: Matt loses V.7.7D on dev hardware permanently; other M2 Pro users likewise.
- Doesn't help users on M3+ silicon (they're already over the bar).
- Needs a new `D-XXX` ("Arachne SPIDER tier-gating: M2 Pro on V.7.5 silhouette; M3+ on V.7.7D 3D SDF").

Scope: 0.5 session. Cheap, but accepts the limitation rather than fixing it.

#### Option C — accept p95 = 16 ms and close with relaxed criteria

Revise the closure criteria to drops-only:

- drops (> 32 ms) ≤ 8 % — **currently 0.7 %, passes**.
- Drop p95 ≤ 14 ms and p50 ≤ 8 ms from the criteria list (or document them as "Tier 2 aspirational targets, M2 Pro is borderline").

Justification: drops are the user-perceptible metric (frame skipped, judder visible). 16 ms p95 means most "over budget" frames still complete within ~16-17 ms — at the edge of one refresh window but rarely dropped by the compositor.

Risk: `FrameBudgetManager` will still downshift quality more aggressively than designed when Arachne is active on M2 Pro (the downshift threshold is 14 ms in the manager's hysteresis logic, not 32 ms). Visible side-effect: SSGI may toggle off mid-segment, etc. Acceptable on borderline silicon; not great on actual Tier 2.

Scope: 1 commit (criteria update + KNOWN_ISSUES status flip + release note). Closes BUG-011 today.

#### Carry-forward (whichever option Matt picks)

- V.7.10 Arachne cert review is unblocked once BUG-011 closes, regardless of which path closes it.
- An M3+ measurement is still a valuable data point under any option — would confirm whether the current state is "M2 Pro is below spec" (M3+ comfortably under p95 = 14 ms) or "Tier 2 budget itself needs revision" (M3+ also over). Cheap to acquire next time the dev environment lines up.

### Verification criteria

- [x] Automated: `shortRunArachneComposite` SOAK benchmark added to `SoakTestHarnessTests` (commit `bd213856`). Kernel-only SOAK_TESTS=1 benchmark. SOAK_TESTS=1 gated; loose 16 ms p95 kernel-only gate on M2 Pro at 1920×1080 with spider forced ON. Post-cheap-cleanup p95 sits at 12.557 ms (3.4 ms inside gate).
- [x] **Closed against relaxed drops-only criteria 2026-05-12.** M2 Pro real-music re-capture in session `2026-05-12T20-30-28Z` (37,821 frames, ~21 min of pinned Arachne): drops (>32 ms) = **0.02 %** passes the 8 % gate by 400× margin. p95 = 15.303 ms and p50 = 13.708 ms remain above their respective design targets (14 ms / 8 ms) — documented as known limitations of borderline Tier 2 hardware (M2 Pro is below the architecture contract's M3+ Tier 2 spec). See "2026-05-12 closure rationale" section above.
- [ ] Manual (deferred, not closure-blocking): re-run on M3+ to confirm budget holds at full feature set on actual Tier 2 silicon. Would clarify whether M2 Pro's 15.3 ms p95 is "M2 Pro below spec" (expected — M3+ comfortably under 14 ms) or "Tier 2 budget needs revision" (M3+ also above). If a future M3+ measurement shows p95 > 14 ms there, reopen with a new BUG-XXX entry.
- [x] Manual: Matt confirmed Arachne fidelity unchanged via the 21-minute pinned re-capture session (`2026-05-12T20-30-28Z`). The L1/L2/L3 + L5 cheap-cleanup changes are individually low-risk by construction; the cumulative visual at real-music scale matches the V.7.7C.5 reference set without observed regression.

- V.7.7C.5 (D-100) — atmospheric reframe just landed; cost growth from V.7.7C.4 baseline likely contributes here, but the bulk of the 14-ms p50 is the V.7.7D spider + V.7.7C drops, both of which predate V.7.7C.5.

### BUG-018 — Stem deviation primitives systematically exceed declared `[0, 1]` ceiling during cold-start

**Severity:** P1 (load-bearing for "preset doesn't look broken" product claim — affects all stem-consuming presets on every track change for ~30 seconds).
**Domain tag:** dsp.stem
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-28** — manual M7 outstanding (Matt's gate).
**Introduced:** Pre-existing. The deviation EMA was added with `stemRunningAvg: [Float] = [0, 0, 0, 0]` (zero-initialised, re-zeroed on `reset()`) and the formula `dev = (energy − runningAvg) × 2.0`. The first post-reset frame has always emitted `2 × energy` instead of 0; bug surfaced explicitly during the CSP.3 → CSP.3.1 dive 2026-05-27 when Matt observed FFO spike heights pinning to the shader's clamp ceiling during cold-start.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-28 — SAR.1. Self-seed each `stemRunningAvg[i]` from the first post-reset frame where stem `i` has non-zero energy. See `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-a]`.

### Expected behavior

`vocalsEnergyDev`, `drumsEnergyDev`, `bassEnergyDev`, `otherEnergyDev` stay within their declared `[0, 1]` range across the session, including immediately after every track change. Rare extreme single-frame transients can exceed 1.0 (the 10-second EMA can't react that fast), but there is no chronic out-of-range pattern across cold-start windows.

### Actual behavior

Every track change produces a ramp from 0 → 8 → 16 → 27 → 38 across ~60 ms at the live-stems handoff, then a ~30-second slow decay back into range. All four stems exhibit the pattern. Pre-fix cross-session scan across 7 recent sessions (2026-05-27, 87,194 total frames):

| Session | bassMax | drumsMax | vocalsMax | otherMax |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2026-05-27T16-09-47Z | 7.44 | 6.68 | 8.52 | 7.11 |
| 2026-05-27T19-38-32Z | 4.81 | 2.79 | 3.87 | 3.12 |
| 2026-05-27T19-44-25Z | 2.09 | 2.33 | 3.00 | 2.00 |
| 2026-05-27T19-47-18Z | 28.07 | 28.65 | 26.31 | 27.05 |
| 2026-05-27T19-52-42Z | 37.69 | 37.28 | 38.68 | 40.85 |
| 2026-05-27T20-29-39Z | 0.75 | 0.64 | 2.63 | 1.05 |
| 2026-05-27T20-32-45Z | 0.76 | 0.68 | 2.69 | 1.03 |

Affected presets (consumers of `*_energy_dev`): Ferrofluid Ocean spike heights, Lumen Mosaic cell colors, Aurora Veil brightness route, Volumetric Lithograph terrain pulse, Membrane kick shockwave. Visual symptom: presets read clamp-saturated input for the first ~30 seconds of each track, producing "stuck on max" behaviour (FFO spike pinning, LM color saturation, etc.). Misattributed to per-preset cold-start design failures during the CSP.2 dive.

### Reproduction steps

1. Play any track in any session-recording-enabled run.
2. Inspect `stems.csv` columns `bassEnergyDev`, `drumsEnergyDev`, `vocalsEnergyDev`, `otherEnergyDev`.
3. Observe: 2–4 % of rows have values > 1.0; max value across a session typically 5–40× the declared ceiling; concentrated in the first ~30 seconds of each track (live-stems convergence window).

**Minimum reproducer:** any captured session. The bug is structural and reproduces on every track change.

### Session artifacts

- **Primary evidence:** `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-27T19-52-42Z/stems.csv` — rows 844–849 show the cold-start ramp 0 → 7.81 → 16.05 → 27.18 → 37.69 across ~60 ms. 185 of 5270 frames (3.51 %) have `bassEnergyDev > 1.0`.
- **Cross-session evidence:** 7-session sweep above. Pattern is structural.
- `features.csv` is not load-bearing here — the deviation primitives are in `stems.csv`. `session.log` shows no anomaly (the EMA math is silent).

### Suspected failure class

`algorithm`. The deviation EMA's running-average initialisation is incompatible with its formula. The two pieces interact correctly in steady state but the first post-reset frame has no defined energy reference, so the formula reduces to `2 × energy` for any non-zero input. Same failure shape as MV-1's authoring intent (D-026: "deviation primitives drive primary motion") presumes the primitives respect their declared range; the analyzer-layer bug invalidates that for ~30 seconds out of every track.

**Evidence for this class:** the math is locally consistent (decay = 0.9989, blend = 0.0011, formula matches the docstring) but the initial-condition handling is wrong. Not a concurrency, sample-rate, or pipeline-wiring failure — the code does exactly what it says, just with the wrong starting state.

### Verification criteria

- [x] Automated: `StemAnalyzerDeviationSeedingTests` suite — 4 tests covering first-frame deviation = 0, steady state stays in `[0, 1]`, `reset()` re-arms the seed, per-stem seeding is independent. All pass.
- [x] Pre-fix cross-session range check (above) confirms the chronic pattern across multiple sessions; documented in `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md [dev-2026-05-28-a]`.
- [ ] **Manual M7:** Matt re-runs the FFO A/B with the `ffoColdStartFixEnabled` toggle. Expected: the 18–30 s "preset stops moving / flickering colors" symptom disappears; CSP.3.1 cold-start motion remains. Fresh session `stems.csv` shows no chronic out-of-range deviation rows (≤ rare single-frame transients only).
- [x] Regression: the long-EMA-time-constant rationale (2026-04-17 Slint outro diagnosis) is preserved — the decay constant 0.9989 is unchanged.

**Manual validation required:** Yes. Subjective gate: the visual response should feel "continuously alive" through the cold-start window on stem-consuming presets, not "saturated then settling."

### Fix scope

Contained. Four lines in `updateEMAsAndComputeDeviations` (StemAnalyzer.swift:259-262) plus docstring updates. No preset shader changes; no engine-wide architecture changes. Steady-state behaviour unchanged. Trivial P1 collapse (per `DEFECT_TAXONOMY.md` — small change, root cause obvious from the empirical artifact, no architectural risk).

### Related

- Increment: SAR.1 (single increment, trivial P1 collapse approved by direct prompt scope).
- Failed Approach: this is the analyzer-layer twin of Failed Approach #31 (absolute thresholds on AGC-normalised energy) — same root pattern (assumes a steady-state reference that doesn't exist on cold-start) at the deviation-primitive layer.
- Decision: D-026 (deviation primitives drive primary motion). SAR.1 makes D-026's design contract empirically true for the first 30 seconds of each track.
- Phase: Phase CSP can resume after SAR.1.

### BUG-007.9 — Hybrid runtime recalibration

**Severity:** P2 (visible on tracks where prep-time calibration over-shoots).
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-07** — manual validation pending.
**Introduced:** Surfaced by manual validation of BUG-007.8 in session `2026-05-07T22-51-36Z`. Of 8 tracks tested, 5 improved, 1 stable, 2 regressed (Around the World drift went from −28 → +101 ms; Levitating from −50 → +56 ms). Cause: prep-time calibrator measures onset timing on **preview MP3** (22 050 Hz, ~96 kbps, non-overlapping FFT = 46 ms resolution) but live tracker fires onsets on **tap audio** (48 000 Hz, full quality, overlapping FFT). When encodings diverge enough, prep bias points wrong way.

**Resolved:** 2026-05-07. Runtime recalibration pass: after stem separation completes (≥10 s of tap audio buffered) AND lock has stabilised (`matchedOnsetCount >= 8`), replay the latest 12 s of tap audio through the same `GridOnsetCalibrator` and override the prep-time bias via new `LiveBeatDriftTracker.applyCalibration(driftMs:)`. One-shot per track. Runtime calibration uses the audio the listener actually hears.

**Expected behavior:** All 8 tracks from session `T22-51-36Z` show drift near zero by ~15 s. Tracks that regressed under BUG-007.8 (Around the World, Levitating) recover; tracks that worked stay correct.

**Diagnosis notes:**
- Same calibration algorithm, different audio sources. Runtime always wins because it measures against played audio.
- Prep-time bias still useful for the first ~15 s before runtime fires.
- If runtime calibrator returns 0 (silent intro, no onsets), prep-time bias retained; `runtimeRecalibrationDone` set true regardless to avoid retry storms.
- Stem-separation cadence (5 s) drives the trigger. Recalibration fires on the first stem-sep callback that meets all gates.
- BUG-007.6 `audioOutputLatencyMs` orthogonal.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` MARKs 39–41 — applyCalibration overrides drift, clamps to ±500 ms, currentGrid + matchedOnsetCount accessors.
- [ ] Manual: drift averages near zero within 15 s of lock on all 8 tracks (especially Around the World, Levitating).
- [ ] Manual: no regression on tracks that worked pre-7.9.
- [ ] Manual: `BUG-007.9: runtime recalibration fired` log line in `session.log` once per track.

**Related:** BUG-007.8 (prep-time calibration — kept as initial bias). BUG-007.6 (display shift — orthogonal). BUG-010 (stem-separation audit — separate).

### BUG-007.8 — Per-track grid-vs-onset offset calibration

**Severity:** P1 (visible — visual fires off the beat by track-specific amounts up to ±100 ms; the dominant residual sync issue after BUG-007.4/5/6 landed).
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-07** — manual validation pending.
**Introduced:** Pre-existing in all prior code; surfaced by session `2026-05-07T22-00-00Z` running an 8-track bass-forward playlist (Billie Jean / AOBTD / Seven Nation Army / Around the World / Get Lucky / Superstition / Levitating / bad guy). Drift averages spanned −95 to +96 ms across the playlist — a 191 ms range. The fixed `audioOutputLatencyMs = 50` constant from BUG-007.6 only compensated one direction; positive-drift tracks were over-corrected, negative-drift tracks under-corrected.

**Resolved:** 2026-05-07. New `GridOnsetCalibrator` runs at preparation time alongside `BeatGridAnalyzer`, replaying the preview audio through the live `BeatDetector` offline and computing the median `(gridBeat − onsetTime)` offset. Stored on `CachedTrackData.gridOnsetOffsetMs`. Applied at playback-time `setBeatGrid` as the EMA's initial drift bias. The drift tracker still runs at runtime to fine-tune if conditions differ; calibration just gives it a correct starting point per track.

**Expected behavior:** Visual orb fires on the kick the listener hears, regardless of track-specific differences in Beat This! grid timing vs sub-bass onset detector latency. Drift EMA converges near zero rather than chasing ±100 ms offsets.

**Actual behavior (pre-fix):**
- Drift varies ±95 ms per track on bass-forward playlists.
- Fixed `audioOutputLatencyMs = 50` correction works for some tracks (negative-drift), fails on others (positive-drift).
- User reports visual sync wandering across tracks even when lock state holds.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Spotify-prepared session with mixed-genre playlist (rock + pop + hip-hop).
2. Watch SpectralCartograph drift readout per track.
3. Pre-fix: drift averages vary widely (Billie Jean −77 ms, bad guy +96 ms, AOBTD −95 ms).
4. Visual orb sync varies track-to-track.

**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm` (variable per-track offset between grid timing and onset detector — runtime EMA chases instead of preparation-time calibrating).

**Diagnosis notes:**
- Beat This! is calibrated on broadband perceptual beat; sub-bass onset detector fires on kick spectral peak in the 20–80 Hz band. The two timestamps for "the beat" can differ by track-specific amounts (10–150 ms).
- Sources of variability: kick attack envelope shapes, sub-bass leakage from synth pads / bass guitar, Beat This!'s training-data biases, our onset detector's FFT-window centring.
- Runtime drift EMA does eventually converge to the right offset, but takes ~4 onsets (~2 s) at 120 BPM. During that time the visual is off. Pre-loading the EMA to the calibrated value fixes this.
- This is a *systemic* fix — not patching a symptom. Replaces the BUG-007.6 `audioOutputLatencyMs = 50` heuristic with per-track measured values. The BUG-007.6 constant is retained as a fallback for live-analysis tracks (no preparation-time calibration available).

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: `GridOnsetCalibratorTests` (5 tests) — empty grid, insufficient samples, silence, aligned kicks, offset kicks.
- [x] Automated: `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` MARKs 36–38 — initialDriftMs seeds EMA, clamps to ±500 ms, backward-compat single-arg setGrid defaults to 0.
- [ ] Manual: replay the 8-track bass-forward playlist from session `T22-00-00Z`; drift averages near ±20 ms (down from ±100 ms).
- [ ] Manual: visual orb fires on the kick the listener hears across all tracks.

**Related:** BUG-007.4/5/6 (orthogonal — patch other symptoms). BUG-008 (offline BPM disagreement — also addresses Beat This! limitations but at the BPM level, not timing).

### BUG-007.4 — Beat-counter "1" misaligned with song's actual downbeat on prepared-cache tracks

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-07** — BUG-007.4a (manual `Shift+B`) + BUG-007.4b (single-dominant auto-rotate) + BUG-007.4c (kick-on-1+3 alternating pattern auto-rotate) landed. Manual validation pending.
**Introduced:** Reported 2026-05-07 from manual validation captures (`2026-05-07T14-28-40Z/` and prior). User-observed: when watching the SpectralCartograph beat-in-bar counter and listening to SLTS / Everlong (Spotify-prepared), the visual "1" does not land on the song's actual perceived downbeat — it lands on what feels like beat 2 or beat 3 of the bar.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-07 — two-step fix.

- **BUG-007.4a (`Shift+B` manual rotation, landed earlier today)**: developer-only keybind that cycles `barPhaseOffset` 0..(beatsPerBar−1). Resets on track change. Confirmed in session `T18-21-37Z` that rotation works as designed.
- **BUG-007.4b (auto-rotate via kick density)**: after `matchedOnsets >= 8` (lock has stabilised), the tracker examines per-slot kick-onset histogram in `slotOnsetCounts` and rotates `_barPhaseOffset` so the dominant slot (where kicks land most often) becomes the displayed "1". One-shot per track. Suppressed if user pressed `Shift+B` first (manual intent wins). No-op if no clear winner — leading slot must have ≥ 4 onsets *and* ≥ 1.5× the runner-up's count. Four-on-the-floor electronic (OMT) has equal kick density on all slots → no rotation, manual `Shift+B` remains the fallback. Tracks with kick on a single dominant slot auto-rotate within 4–8 seconds of lock acquisition.

- **BUG-007.4c (kick-on-1+3 alternating pattern, 2026-05-07)**: BUG-007.4b's 1.5× ratio gate rejected the most common rock/hip-hop pattern — kick on 1 *and* 3 with similar densities. Session `T21-35-22Z` showed the user still pressing `Shift+B` "a bunch" because counts ended up like `[4, 0, 4, 0]` (top:runner = 1.0). BUG-007.4c adds a second detection path: if top and runner-up are within 1.25× of each other AND the other slots sum to ≤ 20 % of the top, the alternating pattern is recognised and the slot matching `firstTightOnsetRawSlot` (typically the song's downbeat — first kick after track start) wins the tiebreak. Falls back to dominant if first-onset doesn't match either leader.

Variance ring + slot histogram + auto-rotate flags + first-onset-slot all reset on `setGrid` so each track starts fresh.

**Confirmed root cause (2026-05-07, after 5-track diagnostic A/B):** Spotify preview URLs return a 30-second clip from somewhere in the song — *often the chorus, not the first 30 seconds*. Beat This! analyzes the clip, builds a grid, and labels the first beat in the clip as "beat 1 of bar 1." That beat in the clip is typically beat 2, 3, or 4 of the original song's bar. When playback starts from the song's beginning and we install the grid with `offsetBy(0)`, the clip's "beat 1" maps to playback time 0 — but the song's actual beat 1 of bar 1 is at playback time 0. The two don't agree. Result: bar-phase rotation per track, depending on where in the bar Spotify's clip happens to begin.

This is **not** a flaw in Beat This!'s downbeat detection — Beat This! is correctly identifying the bar phase *of the clip*. The mismatch is between the clip's coordinate system and the live-playback song coordinate system.

**5-track A/B evidence (sessions `2026-05-07T15-50-23Z` + `2026-05-07T15-58-17Z`):**

| Track | Visual "1" lands on song's | Off by | Spotify preview likely from |
|---|---|---|---|
| One More Time (Daft Punk) | beat 4 | +3 | chorus mid-bar |
| Midnight City (M83) | beat 4 | +3 | chorus mid-bar |
| HUMBLE. (Kendrick) | beat 3 | +2 | chorus / verse mid-bar |
| SLTS (Nirvana) | beat 1 ✓ | 0 | first 30 s (intro) |
| Everlong (Foo Fighters) | beat 3 | +2 | chorus / verse mid-bar |

The varying off-by-N (0, 2, 3) per track rules out a constant pipeline rotation bug. SLTS being the only one that worked correlates with SLTS's preview being the song intro (less commercial tracks tend to preview from start; popular dance/pop tracks preview from chorus).

**Expected behavior:** On a 4/4 prepared-cache track, the SpectralCartograph beat-in-bar counter shows "1" exactly when the song's bar starts (the kick drum + accent that listeners hear as the downbeat). For SLTS, that's the kick on the strong beat after each pickup. For Everlong, the same. `is_downbeat=1` rows in `features.csv` should land at song-relative times that match the ear's perception.

**Actual behavior:** User reports visual "1" lands 2–3 beats away from the audio's perceived "1" on at least SLTS and Everlong (planned, prepared cache, drift CSV near zero). Drift `mean ≈ +2.5 ms` on SLTS and lock state holds steady — beat-phase alignment is correct. Bar-phase / downbeat selection appears to be the variable.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Spotify-prepared session containing SLTS + Everlong.
2. Switch to SpectralCartograph (`Shift+→`); press `L` to lock the diagnostic preset.
3. Play SLTS. Watch the beat-in-bar text readout and the BR-panel BAR-φ row.
4. Listen for the song's perceived downbeats and count along.
5. Observe whether "1" on the visual matches the ear's "1".

**Minimum reproducer:** Any Spotify-prepared session on a 4/4 rock track where the user can mentally count beats. SLTS, Everlong are confirmed. May not affect electronic / four-on-the-floor tracks where every beat is a downbeat-feel.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T14-28-40Z/features.csv` — SLTS first observed `is_downbeat=1` at `playback_time=42.96` (during locked window). Earlier downbeats during locking phase. BPM=117.6 → bar period 2.04 s. Observed downbeat distribution across 4 beat-in-bar values is roughly uniform (1461 / 1462 / 1412 / 1442 frames each), consistent with the meter being identified correctly but the *rotation* (which beat is "1") possibly off.
- `2026-05-07T14-33-47Z/features.csv` — reactive Everlong got `meter=2/X` from a half-time grid (`bpm=85.4`) — that's BUG-009, separate from this bug.

**Confirmed failure class:** `calibration` (Spotify clip start-position not on song bar boundary; Beat This! is correctly identifying bar phase *of the clip*, but the clip's bar phase doesn't equal the song's bar phase from start).

**Fix scope (three options, ranked by leverage):**

**(C) — Developer rotation shortcut (FIRST: ship as BUG-007.4a, ~1 hour).** Add `Shift+B` to `PlaybackShortcutRegistry` to cycle `barPhaseOffset` between 0..N-1 (where N = `beatsPerBar`). Apply offset when computing `beat_in_bar` and `barPhase01` for the SpectralCartograph readouts. Does not fix anything automatically — but lets the user confirm the rotation hypothesis in seconds (cycle Shift+B until "1" lands on the audio's downbeat) and provides an escape hatch for the long-tail tracks the auto-fix won't catch. Cheap, fully reversible.

**(A) — Auto-rotate via kick-density heuristic (durable fix; BUG-007.4b, ~80 LOC + tests).** After the grid is installed and the drift tracker has 8+ matched onsets, examine which of the N beat-in-bar slots has the highest kick energy on average. That slot is the actual song downbeat. Rotate `beat_in_bar` numbering accordingly. Doesn't require Spotify metadata; works on prepared and live grids equally; converges in ~5–10 seconds. Beat This! identifies *meter* (correctly); the heuristic identifies *which beat in that meter is "1"*.

**(B) — Pre-rotate at preparation time (alternative to A).** Run the kick-density heuristic on the cached 30-second preview audio at preparation time, before the grid is stored in `StemCache`. Faster lock-in (no live convergence period), but requires re-running an onset detector on the cached audio. Higher complexity; defer unless (A)'s convergence delay is unacceptable.

**Recommended sequence:** (C) first to confirm theory in <1 hour. Then (A) as the durable fix. (B) deferred unless needed. **Both (C) and (A) landed 2026-05-07.**

**Out of scope:**
- Reactive-mode downbeat detection — different code path; live grids will benefit from (A) automatically since the same heuristic applies post-install.
- Time-displacement (visual ahead of / behind audio in absolute time). Drift CSV shows beats are aligned. This bug is about *which* beat gets labelled "1", not about *when* beats fire.
- Asking Spotify for clip-start-time-in-song metadata — not exposed by their API.

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] (C) lands: `Shift+B` cycles bar-phase offset; visual "1" can be aligned to song's "1" on all 5 test tracks within 0..3 presses. Toast/log confirms current offset.
- [ ] (A) lands: visual "1" lands on song's "1" automatically within 10 s of lock-in on OMT, Midnight City, HUMBLE, SLTS, Everlong. No regression on SLTS.
- [ ] On a fully ambient / non-metric track (no obvious kick density per slot): system gracefully holds the Beat This! choice rather than picking a random slot.

**Related:** BUG-008 (offline BPM disagreement — orthogonal), BUG-007 / 007.2 (lock hysteresis — orthogonal), BUG-007.3 (reverted, `78ade5aa`), BUG-007.5 (separately confirmed by Everlong "pulse slightly off" observation in 2026-05-07T15-58-17Z).

### BUG-007.6 — Tap-vs-output audio latency calibration

**Severity:** P2 (visible — visual fires before audio is heard, persistent across all tracks).
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved (calibration constant + dev shortcut landed 2026-05-07)** — manual validation pending.
**Introduced:** Pre-existing in all prior code; surfaced by the 2026-05-07 5-track A/B (sessions `T15-50-23Z`, `T15-58-17Z`, `T18-21-37Z`) which showed systematic negative drift averaging −36 to −76 ms on every prepared-cache track regardless of BPM. Pattern: tap captures audio L ms before the listener hears it (CoreAudio output buffer + DAC + driver). The tracker's drift converges to roughly −L; the visual orb fires at `pt + drift = pt − L`, before the audio reaches the speaker. User-perceived as "beat in SC feels a little bit faster than the song's actual beat."
**Resolved:** 2026-05-07. New `LiveBeatDriftTracker.audioOutputLatencyMs: Float` (default 0 in engine, set to 50 ms in `VisualizerEngine` app-layer init for internal Mac speakers). Applied to the *display path only* — `displayTime = pt + drift + (audioOutputLatencyMs + visualPhaseOffsetMs) / 1000`. Does NOT touch onset matching or drift estimation: those use unmodified `playbackTime` so the matching path is unchanged. Tunable at runtime via `,` (−5 ms) and `.` (+5 ms) developer shortcuts. Persists across track changes (it's a system property, not a per-track property).

**Expected behavior:** With `audioOutputLatencyMs` calibrated to the platform's actual tap-to-speaker delay, the visual orb pulses in sync with the kick the listener hears.

**Actual behavior (pre-fix):** Visual leads audio by ~50 ms on internal Mac speakers (typical CoreAudio output buffer). Up to several hundred ms on Bluetooth/AirPlay output devices.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Spotify-prepared session, internal Mac speakers, any track that locks reliably (SLTS, OMT).
2. Watch the SpectralCartograph beat orb while listening.
3. Pre-fix: orb pulses just before each audible kick.

**Confirmed failure class:** `calibration`.

**Diagnosis notes:**
- Tap captures pre-output-buffer audio. The audio then takes ~10–50 ms (internal Mac speaker), 100–300 ms (Bluetooth), 500–1500 ms (AirPlay) to reach the listener's ears.
- Onset detection in our pipeline also has some processing delay (~50 ms FFT-window center bias). The combined effect of *output latency* + *detection delay* is what the user perceives. The single calibration constant `audioOutputLatencyMs` collapses both into one knob.
- Applying compensation to *matching* (shifting `pt` before grid lookup) cancels itself out on the display side — `pt + drift` is invariant under shifts of `pt`. So compensation must go on display.
- The diagnostic drift readout in SpectralCartograph remains at its raw negative value (e.g. −50 ms) — that's accurate; it represents detection delay, not perceptual sync. Visual sync is fixed by display-side compensation.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Automated: drift convergence is identical with `audioOutputLatencyMs=0` and `audioOutputLatencyMs=50` on the same input (matching path unaffected). Verified by `audioOutputLatencyMs_shiftsDisplayNotMatching`.
- [x] Automated: at the same playback time, `beatPhase01` differs by L/period between latency=0 and latency=L. Verified by the same test.
- [x] Automated: setter clamps to ±500 ms. Verified by `audioOutputLatencyMs_setter_clampsToRange`.
- [x] Automated: persists across `setGrid` and `reset` (system property). Verified by `audioOutputLatencyMs_persistsAcrossSetGrid`.
- [ ] Manual: SpectralCartograph beat orb pulses in audible sync with kick on SLTS, OMT, Midnight City, HUMBLE, Everlong using internal Mac speakers and the default 50 ms calibration.
- [ ] Manual: `,` / `.` shortcuts adjust visual sync ±5 ms per press; user can dial in a per-output-device offset within 1–2 minutes.

**Out of scope:**
- Persisting `audioOutputLatencyMs` across app launches (currently resets on cold start). Will be a settings-panel field in a future increment.
- Per-output-device automatic detection (Bluetooth vs internal). Future increment if needed.
- Variance-adaptive lock-window logic — that's BUG-007.5.

**Related:** BUG-007.3 (reverted), BUG-007.4 (orthogonal — bar phase rotation), BUG-007.5 (orthogonal — lock-release timing), the existing `visualPhaseOffsetMs` (`[`/`]` shortcut, ±10 ms) which is now additive with this constant on the display path.

### BUG-007.5 — Lock hysteresis for asymmetric drift envelopes

**Severity:** P3 (cosmetic — visual flicker between LOCKED and LOCKING; doesn't affect beat-phase)
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved (parts 1 + 2 + 3, 2026-05-07)** — manual validation pending.
**Introduced:** Surfaced 2026-05-07. Pre-exists BUG-007.3 (the reverted attempt). The fixed-window Schmitt hysteresis (`staleMatchWindow=0.060` in commit `94309858`) attempted this and failed because the "right" stale window depends on the drift variance, which differs by track.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-07 — Two-part fix.

**Part 1 (time-based release gate)**: Replaced the count-based `lockReleaseMisses=7` gate with a *time-based* `lockReleaseTimeSeconds=2.5` gate. Lock now drops when 2.5 s of consecutive non-tight matches have elapsed since the last tight hit, regardless of how many onsets occurred in between. Sparse-onset tracks (HUMBLE half-time at 76 BPM = 790 ms beat period) no longer trip the gate accidentally — what matters is the elapsed time, not the count. Diagnostic counter `consecutiveMisses` retained on `LiveBeatDriftTraceEntry` for backward compat.

**Part 2 (variance-adaptive tight gate)**: Replaced the fixed ±30 ms tight-match window during the *retention* phase (after lock acquired) with an adaptive `effectiveTightWindow = clamp(2σ, 30 ms, 80 ms)` derived from the running stddev of the last 16 `instantDrift − drift` values. Acquisition path still uses the fixed 30 ms floor for selectivity. This closes the remaining lock-flicker on tracks where drift envelope is wider than ±30 ms despite small EMA bias (Midnight City: drift envelope ±20 ms with σ ≈ 12 ms → adaptive window ≈ 24 ms; HUMBLE: σ ≈ 25 ms → adaptive window ≈ 50 ms; B.O.B. polyrhythmic noise: σ ≈ 40 ms → adaptive window clamped at ceiling 80 ms).

Variance ring resets on `setGrid` / `reset` so each track starts fresh at the floor.

**Part 3 (BPM-aware time gate, landed same day)**: replaced the fixed 2.5 s `lockReleaseTimeSeconds` with `effectiveLockReleaseSeconds = max(2.5 s, 4 × medianBeatPeriod)`. At 120+ BPM the gate stays at the 2.5 s floor (4 × 0.5 = 2.0 s, below floor). At HUMBLE half-time (76 BPM, 790 ms period) the gate scales to 3.16 s — accommodates 4 consecutive sparse non-tight events without dropping lock. At 60 BPM (period 1.0 s) the gate reaches 4.0 s. This closes the failure mode where HUMBLE drops lock every ~5 seconds despite small per-onset deviations from the EMA — the issue was sparse onsets accumulating to 2.5 s before a tight match arrived.

**Expected behavior:** Once `lock_state` reaches LOCKED on a track with correct grid BPM, it stays there for the duration of the song unless the input goes silent or the BPM is genuinely wrong. Lock should not flicker due to per-onset noise within ±60 ms of the EMA.

**Actual behavior (on Everlong planned, prepared, BPM=157.8):** Drift envelope spans −68 to +25 ms with EMA settling at −41 ms. Many individual onsets fall 50–80 ms from the EMA — outside the fixed ±60 ms gate that BUG-007.3 attempted. Lock drops 14 times in 75 s (sessions `2026-05-07T14-28-40Z`). On SLTS planned (drift envelope ~ ±50 ms with EMA near zero) the same fixed gate worked: only 2 drops in 105 s. The variance is the variable; a one-size-fits-all stale window doesn't fit both.

**Reproduction steps:** Play Everlong from a Spotify-prepared session, watch the SpectralCartograph mode label flicker between `● PLANNED · LOCKED` and `◑ PLANNED · LOCKING` while the beat orb continues to pulse on the kick (beat-phase alignment is fine; only the lock indicator flickers).

**Minimum reproducer:** Any rock track with a dense, slightly-rushed snare-and-cymbal pattern at 150+ BPM. Everlong is the gold reference.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T14-28-40Z/features.csv` — Everlong rows at BPM=157.8: 14 lock drops, drift min/max −68 / +25, drift mean −41 ms.

**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm`.

**Diagnosis notes:**
- BUG-007.3's premise that ±60 ms covers natural tempo variation was correct on SLTS but wrong on Everlong. SLTS's drift std-dev over a 10 s window is roughly half Everlong's.
- Adaptive approach: track the running std-dev of `instantDrift` over the last N onsets. Define `staleMatchWindow = clamp(K × stddev, 30 ms, 120 ms)`. K ≈ 2 sigma. This auto-widens for noisy material and stays tight for clean material.
- Alternative: track per-onset variance via Welford's algorithm (no allocation, lock-friendly).

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] On Everlong planned: ≤ 1 lock drop in 50 s of continuous playback.
- [ ] On SLTS planned: no regression — still ≤ 2 drops in 100 s.
- [ ] On Billie Jean reactive (control): no regression.
- [ ] Automated regression test: synthetic input with 60 ms-stddev jitter at 158 BPM should hold lock for 60 s with ≤ 1 drop.

**Fix scope (~30 LOC + tests):**
1. Add a small running-variance accumulator on per-onset `instantDrift` values to `LiveBeatDriftTracker` (Welford's online variance, ring of last 16 onsets).
2. Compute `staleMatchWindow = clamp(2.0 × stddev, 30 ms, 120 ms)` per onset.
3. Apply the same Schmitt branching as BUG-007.3's Part (a), but with the dynamic gate.

**Out of scope:**
- Replacing `strictMatchWindow` (acquisition selectivity unchanged).
- Touching the slope-detector / wider-window-retry idea from BUG-007.3 Part (b). That belongs to a *future* increment if BUG-009 doesn't subsume it.

**Related:** BUG-007.3 (reverted attempt — fixed gate). BUG-007.4 (downbeat alignment — orthogonal).

### BUG-009 — Halving-correction threshold (160 BPM) too aggressive; halves legitimate fast tempos

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** **Resolved 2026-05-07** — threshold raised 160 → 175 in `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()`. New regression test `halvingOctaveCorrected_fastRockBPM_isNoOp` covers four fixtures (158 / 168 / 172.5 / 175 BPM) and confirms each passes through unchanged. Existing tests updated for the new boundary; the extreme-double-halve fixture moved from 322 → 360 BPM to retain factor-4 thinning coverage. **Manual validation pending** — next reactive Everlong session should install at `bpm=158 ± 8` (not the pre-fix 85.4 half-time alias).
**Introduced:** DSP.3.5 (2026-05-05). `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()` halves any BPM > 160 to the nearest sub-160 value. Threshold chosen at 160 because most pop / rock / electronic music falls below it. Surfaced 2026-05-07 when reactive Everlong (true ≈158 BPM) received a Beat This! raw output > 160, triggering halving down to 85.4 BPM — visibly wrong.

**Expected behavior:** A track with true tempo in [160, 200] BPM (drum'n'bass, fast metal, jungle, fast electronic, "Everlong"-class rock) gets a grid at its true tempo, not the half-time alias. Halving should fire only when the raw analyser output is more than ~10–15 % above the genuine perceptual tempo — i.e. for true double-time errors.

**Actual behavior:** Threshold is fixed at 160 BPM. Beat This! `small0` outputs ranging 165–180 on tracks with true tempo near 158 (off by < 15 %) get halved unconditionally. Result: half-time grid; visual orb pulses at half rate; bar-phase wrong; user listens to a song at 158 BPM but sees animation at 85.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Reactive (ad-hoc) session, no Spotify preparation.
2. Play Everlong (Foo Fighters).
3. Wait for live grid install at ~10 s.
4. Read `session.log`: `BeatGrid installed: source=liveAnalysis, ..., bpm=85.4, beats=443, meter=2/X`.

**Minimum reproducer:** Any track with true BPM in roughly [160, 175] played in a reactive session. Everlong is the canonical case.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T14-33-47Z/session.log` — `bpm=85.4, beats=443, meter=2/X` on Everlong reactive. True ~158 BPM.

**Suspected failure class:** `calibration`.

**Diagnosis notes:**
- 160 BPM is below typical drum'n'bass (170–175), fast metal (180+), and fast indie rock (Foo Fighters, Strokes, Arctic Monkeys typically 155–170). The threshold was chosen for a 30 s offline window where Beat This! is more accurate; the live 10 s window is noisier and pushes more legitimate tracks above 160.
- Two candidate fixes:
  - (a) Raise threshold to 175 (or 180). Captures most fast-rock without re-enabling true-double-time errors. Risk: doesn't catch an actual 90 BPM track that Beat This! reports as 180.
  - (b) Use BPM confidence from the grid output (number of beats supporting the BPM, drift slope, etc.) rather than a hard threshold. Heavier; would land in a follow-up.
- Pyramid Song (true ≈68 BPM) must stay un-corrected — already protected by BPM > 160 condition. (a) preserves this.

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] On Everlong reactive: live grid installs at `bpm=158 ± 8` (within ±5 %).
- [ ] On Pyramid Song (true 68 BPM): grid stays at 68 BPM, not 136.
- [ ] On Money 7/4 (~123 BPM): no regression.
- [ ] On a confirmed-double-time test track (synthetic 80 BPM that triggers Beat This! to output 160+): halving still fires. Find or synthesize a fixture for this.

**Fix scope (likely ~5 LOC + test):** raise threshold to 175 in `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()`. Add regression test on a 158 BPM input that confirms no halving fires (currently halves; post-fix doesn't).

**Out of scope:**
- BPM-confidence-aware correction (option b above). Defer to future work if option (a) leaves residual bad cases.
- Doubling correction for sub-80 BPM tracks (already disabled by design — Pyramid Song would break).

**Related:** DSP.3.5 (introduced halving correction); BUG-008 (offline BPM disagreement — orthogonal). BUG-007.3 (reverted; surfaced this issue but didn't address it).

### BUG-007.3 — Lock hysteresis still oscillates on drift-prone tracks; live BPM resolver fragile on busy mid-frequency content

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Closed (attempt reverted — see commit `78ade5aa`). Replaced by BUG-007.4 + BUG-007.5 + BUG-009.
**Introduced:** Surfaced 2026-05-07 during manual validation of two sessions captured post-QR.2 (`~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-27-14Z/` planned, `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-30-46Z/` reactive). Predates QR.2 (QR.2 did not change drift-tracker semantics). BUG-007.2 widened `lockReleaseMisses` 3 → 7, which closed the 30 s freeze + the 400 ms/487 ms adversarial scenario but left two additional failure modes.
**Reverted:** 2026-05-07. The Schmitt hysteresis (Part a) + drift-slope retry (Part b) implementation in commit `94309858` was reverted in commit `78ade5aa` after manual validation evidence (`2026-05-07T14-28-40Z` + `T14-33-47Z`) showed Everlong planned regressed (14 lock drops vs 5 pre-fix). The fix's premise — that wider stale-OK retention would close natural-tempo-variation drops — held on SLTS but not on Everlong, where the drift envelope is asymmetric around its EMA (−68 to +25 ms with avg −41 ms) and many onsets land outside ±60 ms of the EMA. Net: the fix improved one track and worsened another. User also observed downbeat misalignment ("1" not on song's downbeat) which drift CSV cannot rule in or out — beat phase was correct (drift ≈ 0 on SLTS) but bar-phase / downbeat selection may be wrong. Three follow-up bugs scoped (BUG-007.4 / 007.5 / 009).

**Expected behavior:** On any track where the offline/live BPM is within ±1 % of true tempo, `lock_state` reaches `2` (LOCKED) and stays there for the duration of the track, with `drift_ms` settling into a band whose `stddev` over a 10 s window is below ~25 ms. On busy mid-frequency tracks (rock, power chords) where the live 10 s window is insufficient, the system either widens its analysis window or surfaces a warning, but does not silently lock to a 4 % wrong BPM.

**Actual behavior:** Two distinct mechanisms.

- **Mechanism C — natural-music tempo variation drops lock under correct BPM.** Smells Like Teen Spirit (planned, prepared cache, `grid_bpm=117.6`, true ≈117) held lock for 80 s straight but `drift_ms` walked from +15 → −90 over 90 s. Everlong (planned, prepared, `grid_bpm=157.8`) dropped lock 5 times in 50 s with drift in the −30 to −68 ms band, even though BPM was correct. The drops were caused by individual onsets falling outside `abs(instantDrift − drift) < strictMatchWindow=30 ms` for ≥ 7 consecutive onsets. At ≈158 BPM that is a 2.7 s window, and noisy onsets (harmonics, reverb tail, snare bleed) cluster easily. The 30 ms tight-match gate is too strict for the natural micro-timing variation of real performances.

- **Mechanism D — live BPM resolver returns 4 % low on busy mid-frequency content.** Reactive Everlong gave `grid_bpm=151.9` (true ≈158, 3.86 % low). Drift went from 0 → −358 ms over 75 s — roughly one full beat. Billie Jean (synth pop, kick on the beat) gave `grid_bpm=117.1` (true ≈117) and drift stayed bounded ±90 ms. The 10 s live window at busy power-chord-guitar onset density does not give Beat This! enough evidence to nail the BPM within 1 %.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Start a Spotify-prepared session containing Smells Like Teen Spirit and Everlong.
2. Play SLTS → Everlong while Phosphene runs.
3. Observe: `lock_state` reaches 2 on both, but Everlong drops 5+ times; both walk negative drift.
4. Then start an ad-hoc (reactive) session and play Everlong.
5. Observe: `grid_bpm=151.9`, drift goes to −358 ms by ~75 s.

**Minimum reproducer:**
- Mechanism C: any prepared-cache session on a track with natural human tempo variation > 0.3 % over 60 s. SLTS, Everlong, and most rock/indie material qualify.
- Mechanism D: any reactive session on Everlong (or comparable busy mid-frequency content). Quiet-intro tracks (SLTS) recover via the 20 s retry path; high-onset-density tracks do not.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-27-14Z/features.csv` — SLTS held LOCKED 4806 frames (80 s); Everlong dropped 5 times. Drift slopes documented in chat analysis 2026-05-07.
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-07T13-30-46Z/features.csv` — Reactive Everlong drift 0 → −358 ms over 75 s; reactive Billie Jean drift bounded ±90 ms (control case).

**Confirmed failure class:** `algorithm` (Mechanism C — over-strict tight-match gate without asymmetric hysteresis) + `calibration` (Mechanism D — 10 s live window insufficient for busy mid-freq onset density).

**Diagnosis notes:**
- Mechanism C is *not* solved by raising `lockReleaseMisses` further. With the gate already at 7, raising it to 12 just delays inevitable drops on tracks with > 7-onset stretches of natural micro-timing variation. The fix is asymmetric hysteresis: keep the 30 ms gate for *entering* lock (selectivity), use a wider gate (e.g. 60 ms) for *staying* locked (stickiness). This is the standard Schmitt-trigger pattern.
- Mechanism D cannot be solved by lock hysteresis at all — the BPM itself is wrong. The fix is at the resolver layer: wider live window (10 s → 20 s) on retry, and a drift-slope detector that re-triggers live analysis when sustained drift slope exceeds a threshold for ≥ 10 s.
- Drift sign is consistently negative across all tracks, suggesting a small constant tap-output latency contribution (~10–15 ms) on top of any BPM error. Not addressed by this bug — would be a separate calibration constant if pursued.

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] On SLTS planned (prepared cache, BPM=117.6): `lock_state == 2` for ≥ 95 % of frames after first lock; `stddev(drift_ms over 10 s window) < 25 ms`.
- [ ] On Everlong planned (prepared cache, BPM=157.8): ≤ 1 lock drop in 50 s of continuous playback.
- [ ] On Everlong reactive: either grid BPM converges to within ±1 % of 158 within 30 s of playback (via wider retry window), or `WARN: live BPM credibility low` is logged and the system stays in LOCKING rather than locking to a wrong grid.
- [ ] On Billie Jean reactive (control): no regression — drift stays bounded ±90 ms, lock holds.
- [ ] Automated: a deterministic regression test in `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` simulating an outlier-onset stream within a 30 ms-EMA-correct grid demonstrates Mechanism C is closed (≤ 1 lock drop per 60 s of synthetic input where current code drops ≥ 4).
- [ ] Manual: drift readout in SpectralCartograph stays close to zero on SLTS and Everlong (planned). Beat orb pulse sits exactly on the kick across both tracks.

**Fix scope (BUG-007.3 — one increment, two parts):**

**Part (a) — Asymmetric Schmitt-style hysteresis (small, ~15 LOC + tests).** In `LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift`:

```swift
// New constant:
private static let staleMatchWindow: Double = 0.060   // ±60 ms — once locked, stay locked

// In update(), replace the single isTight gate with:
let isTight = abs(instantDrift - drift) < Self.strictMatchWindow
let isStaleOK = abs(instantDrift - drift) < Self.staleMatchWindow
let alreadyLocked = (matchedOnsets >= Self.lockThreshold) && (consecutiveMisses < Self.lockReleaseMisses)

if isTight {
    matchedOnsets = min(matchedOnsets + 1, Int.max - 1)
    consecutiveMisses = 0
} else if alreadyLocked && isStaleOK {
    // While locked, a "stale-OK" onset doesn't increment matchedOnsets but
    // also doesn't increment consecutiveMisses — preserves lock under natural
    // tempo variation without making lock easier to acquire initially.
    // matchedOnsets unchanged
} else {
    consecutiveMisses += 1
}
```

This keeps lock-acquisition selectivity (still need 4 ±30 ms hits) but raises lock-retention stickiness to ±60 ms.

**Part (b) — Live-BPM credibility gate + retry with wider window (medium, ~50 LOC + tests).** Two pieces:

1. **Drift-slope detector** in `LiveBeatDriftTracker`: maintain a small ring of `(playbackTime, drift)` samples (~30 entries, ~3 s at 10 Hz onset rate). Expose `currentDriftSlope() -> Double?` returning ms/sec when ≥ 5 samples cover ≥ 5 s; nil otherwise. Called from `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector` once per frame; result published on a new `latestDriftSlope` property.

2. **Retry trigger** in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded()`: in addition to the existing two-attempt schedule (10 s, 20 s on empty grid), add a third condition — if `liveDriftTracker.hasGrid && abs(currentDriftSlope) > 5.0 ms/sec` sustained for ≥ 10 s, and at least 30 s have passed since the last attempt, trigger a re-analysis with a 20 s window (vs the standard 10 s). Cap retries at 3 per track. Log `WARN: live BPM credibility low (slope=Xms/s) — retrying with 20 s window`.

If the wider window also produces an out-of-band BPM estimate (slope still > 5 ms/sec after the retry), log `WARN: live BPM unstable on this track` and *retain the previous grid* rather than installing a new wrong one — better to keep visuals close-but-drifting than to thrash through three different wrong grids.

**Out of scope for this increment:**
- Fixing the consistent ~10–15 ms negative-drift offset (likely tap-output latency calibration). Tracked separately if pursued.
- Replacing the offline Beat This! resolver (BUG-008 — independent).
- Changes to `strictMatchWindow` itself. Selectivity at acquisition time stays at ±30 ms.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day. Part (a) is ~half a day including the deterministic regression test; part (b) is ~half a day including the 20 s window retry path and the slope-detector unit test.

**Related:** BUG-007.2 (resolved upstream — covers Mechanism A + B; this bug covers Mechanisms C + D), BUG-008 (offline BPM disagreement — independent), DSP.3.4 (sample-rate fix on live path), DSP.3.5 (octave correction + retry — already established the multi-attempt pattern this fix extends), QR.1 (touched the file but did not change lock semantics).

### BUG-003 — DSP.3.6 / DSP.3.7 tests not yet implemented

**Severity:** P3
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** DSP.3 planning (gap in coverage)
**Resolved:** 2026-05-07 by QR.3 (`LiveDriftValidationTests.swift` lands the DSP.3.7 surface; DSP.3.6 was previously closed by `PreparedBeatGridAppLayerWiringTests`, BUG-006.2).

**Expected behavior:** App-layer wiring integration test verifies the full chain `SessionPreparer.prepare() → StemCache.store() → resetStemPipeline(for:) → mirPipeline.liveDriftTracker.hasGrid == true`. Live drift validation replay test verifies LOCKED within 5 s, drift < 50 ms, and beat phase zero-crossings within ±30 ms on Love Rehab.

**Actual behavior:** These tests do not exist. The wiring is tested indirectly via DSP.2 S6 integration tests, but the app-layer chain from session preparation through to drift tracker activation is not explicitly asserted.

**Minimum reproducer:** Review `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` DSP.3.6 and DSP.3.7 status.

**Session artifacts:** n/a

**Suspected failure class:** documentation-drift (gap in test coverage, not a behavioral bug)

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] DSP.3.6 test file exists and passes: `swift test --filter BeatGridAppLayerWiringTests` — landed as `PreparedBeatGridAppLayerWiringTests` (BUG-006.2, 2026-05-06). Six cases, all pass.
- [x] DSP.3.7 test file exists and passes: `swift test --filter LiveDriftValidation` — landed as `LiveDriftValidationTests` (QR.3, 2026-05-07). Drives the production tracker against love_rehab.m4a; observed lock at 6.55 s, max drift 14 ms, alignment 90 %.

**Fix scope:** Two new test files in `Tests/Integration/`. No production code changes anticipated. Both landed.

**Related:** DSP.3.6, DSP.3.7, QR.3, D-090.

### BUG-006 — Spotify-prepared session does not install prepared BeatGrid (falls through to liveAnalysis)

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved (wiring — downstream BUG-007 / BUG-008 prevent full LOCKED but the prepared-grid path itself is wired correctly end-to-end)
**Introduced:** Unknown — first observed during QR.1 manual validation 2026-05-06; predates QR.1 (QR.1 did not touch the prepared-grid wiring path).
**Resolved:** 2026-05-06 (BUG-006.2, wiring path validated end-to-end via session capture `2026-05-06T20-11-46Z`. Two downstream issues — BUG-007 lock-hysteresis, BUG-008 offline BPM accuracy — prevent SpectralCartograph from reaching `● PLANNED · LOCKED` but are independent of BUG-006 and tracked separately).

**Expected behavior:** When a Spotify playlist is loaded and `SessionPreparer` completes preparation, each track's `CachedTrackData.beatGrid` is non-empty. On track change in playback, `resetStemPipeline(for: identity)` finds the cache entry and emits `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL: source=preparedCache, track=…, bpm=…, beats=…` to `session.log`. SpectralCartograph displays `◐ PLANNED · UNLOCKED` immediately on first audio, then advances to `● PLANNED · LOCKED` within the first bar or two.

**Actual behavior:** SpectralCartograph mode label stays at `○ REACTIVE` for the entire opening of the track. `session.log` contains zero `source=preparedCache` install entries. Eventually `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL: source=liveAnalysis` fires once the live Beat This! trigger reaches its 10 s window — but only because the prepared cache returned nil and the live fallback was permitted. The mode label only advances past `REACTIVE` after the live grid lands.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Launch Phosphene fresh.
2. Connect a Spotify playlist that includes Love Rehab (Chaim).
3. Wait for `.ready`. Press play in Spotify.
4. Press `Shift+→` to advance to Spectral Cartograph.
5. Watch the mode label and `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/<latest>/session.log`.

**Minimum reproducer:** Any Spotify playlist on a fresh launch.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-06T14-14-22Z/session.log` — zero `source=preparedCache` entries; first `source=liveAnalysis` entry at `14:16:58Z` for Pyramid Song (~2 minutes after `track → Love Rehab`).
- `features.csv` from the same session — `lock_state` and `grid_bpm` columns presumably zero throughout the early playback window.

**Suspected failure class:** `pipeline-wiring`

**Evidence:**
- `VisualizerEngine+InitHelpers.swift:85–98` correctly wires `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` into `SessionPreparer`.
- `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:354 resetStemPipeline(for:)` correctly checks `stemCache?.loadForPlayback(track: identity)` and logs both branches (`source=preparedCache` on hit, `source=none` on miss).
- The session log shows neither branch fired for Love Rehab, which means `resetStemPipeline(for:)` was not called for the track *or* the `stemCache` was nil at the call site.
- DSP.3.1/3.2 added a pre-fire call to `resetStemPipeline(for: plan.tracks.first?.track)` at the end of `_buildPlan()` (D-078). If `_buildPlan()` did not run, this pre-fire never happened. Hypothesis: planned-session path is not being entered when Spotify playlist preparation completes, falling through to ad-hoc reactive behaviour despite the user thinking they used the playlist flow.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Loading a known-prepared Spotify playlist produces at least one `BEAT_GRID_INSTALL: source=preparedCache` entry in `session.log` per track played. **Confirmed in capture `2026-05-06T20-11-46Z`** — 6 tracks prepared with non-empty grids; 2 tracks played (Love Rehab, Money) and both produced `source=preparedCache` install lines on track-change.
- [ ] On Love Rehab specifically: SpectralCartograph mode label transitions `◐ PLANNED · UNLOCKED → ● PLANNED · LOCKED` within 5 s of audio. **Blocked by BUG-008** (Love Rehab prepared grid is 5.5% slow → drift accumulates beyond search window) and **BUG-007** (lock hysteresis fails even with correct drift).
- [x] `features.csv` `grid_bpm` column non-zero from frame 1 of the track. **Confirmed**: Love Rehab `grid_bpm=118.126`, Money `grid_bpm=123.232` — non-zero from frame 1 in `2026-05-06T20-11-46Z` capture. Accuracy issue tracked separately as BUG-008.
- [ ] Manual: drift readout (Δ) settles near zero (±20 ms) within the first bar. **Blocked by BUG-007 + BUG-008.**
- [x] Six new automated regression tests in `PreparedBeatGridAppLayerWiringTests` close the BUG-003 coverage gap that let this ship.

**Resolution (BUG-006.2, 2026-05-06):** Two coordinated fixes. **(Cause 1)** `engine.stemCache` is now wired to `sessionManager.cache` in `VisualizerEngine.init` immediately after `makeSessionManager` returns. Both references point to the same `StemCache` instance — `SessionPreparer` writes fill the cache as preparation completes; the engine reads them on track-change without any explicit hand-off. The field had been declared at `VisualizerEngine.swift:171` since the original session-preparation work but was never assigned anywhere, so `resetStemPipeline(for:)` always took the cache-miss branch. **(Cause 2)** `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift` now resolves the canonical `TrackIdentity` from `livePlan` via the new `PlannedSession.canonicalIdentity(matchingTitle:artist:)` helper. Streaming metadata (Apple Music / Spotify Now Playing AppleScript) only carries title+artist; the planner stored full identities (duration + spotifyID + spotifyPreviewURL hint). The pure-function helper in the Orchestrator module is testable from `PhospheneEngineTests`. Falls back to the partial identity when `livePlan` is nil (preserving ad-hoc reactive behaviour) or when more than one planned track shares the same title+artist pair (preserves conservative behaviour over the wrong cache hit).

New tests: `PreparedBeatGridAppLayerWiringTests` (6 cases) — `engineStemCache_isWiredAfterSessionPrepare`, `trackChangeIdentity_matchesPlannedIdentity`, `ambiguousMatch_returnsNil_partialFallback`, `noMatch_returnsNil`, `endToEndProduces_preparedCacheInstall`, `partialIdentity_withoutCanonicalResolution_missesCache` (negative control pinning the regression direction). All pass. Full engine suite green modulo two documented pre-existing flakes (`MetadataPreFetcher.fetch_networkTimeout`, `MemoryReporter.residentBytes growth`).

The `WIRING:` instrumentation from BUG-006.1 stays in place — it costs nothing at runtime, validates the fix in any session capture, and will catch future regressions. Removal deferred to QR.5 cleanup once the fix has stabilized across multiple sessions.

### BUG-007 — LiveBeatDriftTracker loses lock under stable real-music input (LOCKING ↔ LOCKED oscillation)

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved (BUG-007.2, 2026-05-06)
**Introduced:** Unknown — first observed during QR.1 manual validation 2026-05-06; predates QR.1 (QR.1 did not change drift-tracker lock semantics — only widened `playbackTime` to `Double`).
**Resolved:** 2026-05-06 (BUG-007.2). Fix A: `mirPipeline.setBeatGrid(cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0))` in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift resetStemPipeline(for:)` — eliminates Mechanism B (horizon exhaustion) on all prepared-cache sessions. Fix B: `lockReleaseMisses = 7` (was 3) in `LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift` — eliminates Mechanism A oscillation on cadence-mismatch input; note the implemented value is 7, not the 5 in the diagnosis document, because the deterministic 400 ms/487 ms adversarial test scenario produces exactly-5 consecutive miss runs that trip the threshold at 5 (7 × 400 ms = 2.8 s hysteresis window; well within spec intent). Diagnostic test `test_mechanismB` updated from raw-grid bug-documenter to extrapolated-grid fix-verifier (test setup changed; `#expect` assertion unchanged). Three regression gates in `LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` (tests 16–18).

**Expected behavior:** Once `LiveBeatDriftTracker.computeLockState()` returns `.locked` (after `matchedOnsets ≥ lockThreshold`), the tracker remains `.locked` for the duration of the track unless the input has gone genuinely silent for ≥ 2 × medianBeatPeriod. Onset-time drift settles into a band ±30 ms wide (the `strictMatchWindow`) and stays there.

**Actual behavior:** Two independent mechanisms prevent lock from holding:

- **Mechanism B (primary — plateau/freeze after ~30 s):** The prepared-cache install path (`resetStemPipeline(for:)`) calls `mirPipeline.setBeatGrid(cached.beatGrid)` without `offsetBy()`. The prepared grid covers only the 30-second Spotify preview. Once `playbackTime` exceeds ~30 s, `nearestBeat()` returns nil for all subsequent onsets. `consecutiveMisses` reaches `lockReleaseMisses=3` after 3 × 400 ms = 1.2 s, lock drops to `.locking`, and never recovers. Drift EMA freezes at its last-update value permanently.

- **Mechanism A (secondary — oscillation in 0..30 s window):** Sub_bass BeatDetector cooldown is 400 ms; Money's beat period is 487 ms. These cadences produce a ~71 % miss rate (44 of 62 onsets in the session capture). With `lockReleaseMisses=3`, 3 consecutive misses (~1.2 s) drop lock; the next hit (~400 ms later) re-acquires. Net: lock oscillates at ~1–2 s frequency throughout the 30-second live window.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Start a Spotify-prepared session for a playlist containing Money (Pink Floyd).
2. Play Money in Spotify while Phosphene is running.
3. Switch to Spectral Cartograph (`Shift+→`).
4. Observe mode label: oscillates `◑ PLANNED · LOCKING` ↔ `● PLANNED · LOCKED` in 0..30 s, then drops permanently to `◑` after ~30 s.

**Minimum reproducer:** Any Spotify-prepared session where `playbackTime > 30 s`. The 30-second Spotify preview always produces a grid of ~30 s coverage; without `offsetBy()`, every track freezes at ~30 s.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-06T20-11-46Z/` — Money 7/4, prepared grid bpm=123.2.
  - 62 onsets, 18 hits (71 % miss rate).
  - Last match: t=29.8121 s, drift=+14.396 ms.
  - Lock dropped to LOCKING: t=31.0949 s (frame 5459), drift frozen at +14.396 ms permanently.
- Diagnosis document: `docs/diagnostics/BUG-007-diagnosis.md`.
- Diagnostic test suite: `PhospheneEngine/Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Diagnostics/LiveDriftLockHysteresisDiagnosticTests.swift` (gated: `BUG_007_DIAGNOSIS=1`).

**Confirmed failure class:** `api-contract` (BUG-R001 fix applied to live Beat This! path in DSP.3.4 but not to the prepared-cache path) + `algorithm` (lock-hysteresis `lockReleaseMisses=3` too small for 71 % miss-rate input).

**Diagnosis notes:**
- The plateau at −90.490 ms on Love Rehab is the same Mechanism B. Love Rehab's plateau is negative (BUG-008: grid BPM 5.5 % too slow → drift walks negative) rather than positive, but the freeze mechanism is identical.
- Check 2 (sensitivity sweep): widening `strictMatchWindow` from 30 ms to 50 ms would make ~83 %→100 % of the 18 hits count as tight, but does NOT reduce the 71 % nil-return miss rate. Not the fix.
- Check 3 (decay path): inter-onset gap 400 ms < 2 × 487 ms = 974 ms decay threshold → decay path never fires. Not the cause of the plateau.

**Verification criteria:**
- [ ] Once `lock_state` reaches `2` (locked) on a stable track, it stays at `2` for ≥ 30 s of continuous playback at the same tempo. (**Manual validation pending — blocked by BUG-008 on Love Rehab; automated gate passes.**)
- [ ] `drift_ms` values in `features.csv` settle into a ±30 ms band and the standard deviation over a 10-s window is < 15 ms. (**Blocked by BUG-008 on Love Rehab; independent of this fix.**)
- [ ] Manual: orb pulse sits exactly on the kick (not "mostly in time"), and the BR-panel beat-phase tick lines up with the beat orb's flash.
- [x] `BUG_007_DIAGNOSIS=1 swift test --filter test_mechanismB` prints a lock_state of `2` at t=40 s — **passes** (was: `1`).
- [x] `BUG_007_DIAGNOSIS=1 swift test --filter test_mechanismA` prints ≤ 2 oscillations in 60 s — **passes with 0 oscillations** (was: multiple per minute).
- [x] `swift test --filter LiveBeatDriftTrackerTests` — all 18 tests pass.

**Fix scope (BUG-007.2 — one increment):**

Fix A (primary, 1 line — eliminates Mechanism B entirely):
```swift
// In VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift resetStemPipeline(for:), prepared-cache branch:
mirPipeline.setBeatGrid(cached.beatGrid.offsetBy(0))   // was: no offsetBy()
```

Fix B (secondary, 1 line — eliminates Mechanism A oscillation):
```swift
// In LiveBeatDriftTracker.swift:
private static let lockReleaseMisses: Int = 7   // was: 3
```
Note: the diagnosis document stated 5; the implemented value is 7. The deterministic 400 ms/487 ms adversarial regression test produces exactly 5 consecutive miss runs that trip a threshold of 5 on every other cycle; 7 clears the worst-case gap (7 × 400 ms = 2.8 s hysteresis, in line with the spec intent of "multiple non-detections required").

Fix A closes the primary issue on all tracks (prepared-cache sessions, playback > 30 s). Fix B eliminates oscillation on any cadence-mismatch scenario. Both shipped in one increment. Widening `strictMatchWindow` is explicitly NOT needed.

**Related:** DSP.2 S7, DSP.3.4 (fixed the same issue on live path — prepared-cache path missed), D-077, D-079 (touched file but did not change lock semantics), BUG-008 (Love Rehab has an additional BPM-offset symptom on top of this bug). Commits: BUG-007.1 diagnosis `f616bdb1`; BUG-007.2 fix `4fc58bdf` + SwiftLint cleanup `3a5c9a86`.

### BUG-008 — Offline BeatGrid disagrees with MIR BPM estimator on some tracks

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved (BUG-008.2, 2026-05-06) — disagreement is now logged at preparation time. Underlying upstream-model behaviour unchanged by design; neither estimator is mechanically "right" per BUG-008.1 diagnosis.
**Introduced:** Surfaced by BUG-006.2 fix on 2026-05-06; predates BUG-006.2 (the offline analyzer has been producing this output since DSP.2 S5 landed — was previously masked because `engine.stemCache` was never assigned, so the prepared grid was never actually used at runtime). Diagnosis (BUG-008.1) traces the disagreement to genuine musical interpretation differences between the two estimators, *not* to any Phosphene code path.
**Resolved:** 2026-05-06 (BUG-008.2 — `BPMMismatchCheck.swift` + wiring in `SessionPreparer+WiringLogs.swift`. Disagreement now surfaces as a `WARN: BPM mismatch` line in `session.log` whenever the offline grid and MIR estimator differ by more than 3 %. No runtime behaviour change — `LiveBeatDriftTracker` continues to consume the offline grid).

**Expected behavior:** Two BPM estimators run during preparation — `TrackProfile.bpm` (MIR / DSP.1 trimmed-mean IOI on sub_bass kicks) and `CachedTrackData.beatGrid.bpm` (Beat This! transformer). When they disagree by more than 3 %, the disagreement is surfaced in `session.log` so future per-track judgment can be informed by data rather than tags. Phosphene does not assert which estimator is "correct"; both are valid interpretations of the same audio.

**Actual behavior (pre-BUG-008.2):** The disagreement was silent. Love Rehab specifically reports MIR=125.0 / grid=118.1 (5.5 % delta), Beat This! locks to the perceptual beat (broader-spectrum accent integration, what the model was trained to predict on human tap annotations) while the kick-rate IOI estimator locks to the kick interval. Money 7/4 (1.4 %) and Pyramid Song 16/8 (2.86 %) fell within the threshold and would not warn. The `LiveBeatDriftTracker` consumes the offline grid; on Love Rehab specifically this drives `drift_ms` linearly negative against the live tap (which corresponds to the kick rate), pegging at the −90 ms search-window edge by 31 s. **That secondary symptom is BUG-007** — independent and not addressed by this fix.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. Connect a Spotify playlist that includes Love Rehab (Chaim).
2. Wait for `.ready`. Inspect `WIRING: SessionPreparer.beatGrid track='Love Rehab'` in `session.log`.
3. Confirm `bpm=118.1` (or thereabouts — re-check determinism on repeated preparations).
4. Play the track. Observe `features.csv`: `grid_bpm` column reads `118.126`, `drift_ms` walks negative, lock_state never reaches 2 stably.

**Minimum reproducer:** Any Spotify preparation of Love Rehab with the post-BUG-006.2 wiring active.

**Session artifacts:**
- `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/2026-05-06T20-11-46Z/session.log` lines 5–10 — all six tracks' offline BPMs:
  - Blue in Green (true ~70 swing): bpm=56.1
  - Love Rehab (true 125): **bpm=118.1**
  - Mountains: bpm=96.1
  - Pyramid Song (true ~68): bpm=70.0
  - Money (true ~120 in 7/4): bpm=123.2
  - If I Were with Her Now: bpm=103.7
- `features.csv` from the same session — Love Rehab `drift_ms` column walks −20 → −90 → plateau at −90.490 by frame 2398 (31 s in).

**Suspected failure class:** `algorithm` (Beat This! accuracy on this audio file). **Confirmed by BUG-008.1 diagnosis** — `calibration` and `pipeline-wiring` are ruled out.

**Diagnosis (BUG-008.1, 2026-05-06):** See `docs/diagnostics/BUG-008-diagnosis.md` for the full writeup. Summary:

- The vendored PyTorch reference fixture `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Fixtures/beat_this_reference/love_rehab_reference.json` was generated by running the official Beat This! Python implementation (commit `9d787b97`) on the same `love_rehab.m4a` audio file. It reports `bpm_trimmed_mean = 118.05` — **the upstream model itself produces 118 BPM on this audio.** The fixture's `description` field already used the qualifier "**~**125 BPM" — the fixture author knew the model was producing 118.
- The Phosphene Swift port returns 118.10 BPM (within rounding of the upstream).
- Three already-committed regression tests (`BeatThisPreprocessorTests.test_loveRehab_goldenMatch` at 1e-3 tolerance on the spectrogram, `BeatThisModelTests.test_loveRehab_endToEnd_producesBeats` on layer-by-layer activations, `BeatGridResolverGoldenTests.test_bpm_withinTolerance` at ±0.5 BPM) prove the entire port chain is faithful to the PyTorch reference end-to-end.
- The preprocessor's spectrogram match against the Python reference at `max|Δ| ≈ 3e-5` is dispositive evidence that AVAudioConverter resampling is correct — any ratio drift would fail that gate.
- DSP.1 baseline data (`docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-baseline-love_rehab.txt`) shows two of three independent estimators on the same audio agree with Beat This!: autocorrelation produces 117.45 BPM stable, and only the kick-only sub_bass IOI trimmed-mean produces 124–129. The kick is on every quarter note in this track; the broader-spectrum detectors are seeing accent structure that places the perceptual beat 2.5 % wider than the kick interval. **This is a model-level disagreement about what "the beat" is, not a Phosphene bug.**

**Diagnostic test added:** `Tests/PhospheneEngineTests/Diagnostics/BeatGridAccuracyDiagnosticTests.swift` — two tests:
- `test_loveRehab_portMatchesPyTorchReference_notMetadataTag` runs `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` end-to-end on the vendored fixture and asserts the produced BPM matches the PyTorch reference (118.05 ± 0.5) and is NOT within ±3 BPM of the metadata-tag tempo (125). Permanent tripwire on port-fidelity to upstream.
- `test_synthesizedKick_modelRecoversKnownBPM` (parametrized at 120/125/130 BPM) feeds a synthetic 60 Hz exponentially-decaying kick on every quarter note through the full analyzer at 44.1 kHz native (resamples to 22.05 kHz internally). **Result: 125.0 BPM input → 125.00 BPM produced exactly; 130.0 → 130.09 (essentially exact); 120.0 → 117.97 (-1.7 %, small tempo-specific artifact).** This conclusively settles that the model is *capable* of returning 125 BPM at this tempo on machine-quantized input — so the 118 it produces on Love Rehab reflects the track's actual perceptual-beat structure, not an accuracy ceiling. Both tests pass today; the printed numbers are the deliverable.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] `DefaultBeatGridAnalyzer` BPM matches the upstream PyTorch reference within ±0.5 BPM. **Confirmed** by `BeatGridAccuracyDiagnosticTests` (passing).
- [x] Phosphene preprocessing chain pinned to upstream reference at 1e-3 spectrogram tolerance. **Confirmed** by existing `BeatThisPreprocessorTests.test_loveRehab_goldenMatch`.
- [x] Phosphene model output pinned to upstream reference at layer-by-layer tolerance. **Confirmed** by existing `BeatThisLayerMatchTests` + `BeatThisBugRegressionTests`.
- [x] Beat This! is accurate at 125 BPM on machine-quantized input. **Confirmed** by `test_synthesizedKick_modelRecoversKnownBPM` (125.0 BPM input → 125.00 produced exactly). The 118 BPM on Love Rehab reflects the track's perceptual-beat structure, not a model accuracy ceiling.
- [x] Disagreement between MIR and offline-grid BPM is surfaced in `session.log` when delta > 3 %. **Confirmed** by `BPMMismatchCheckTests` (7 pure-function tests) and `bpmMismatch_wiring_doesNotCrash_andGridReachesCache` (integration smoke).
- [ ] `drift_ms` stays inside ±30 ms for the duration of a 60-second segment on Love Rehab. **Tracked under BUG-007** — the drift-tracker lock-hysteresis bug is independent of which BPM is "correct" and must be closed first before this can be re-evaluated meaningfully.

**Fix proposal (BUG-008.2 scope):** The fix is *not* a port-fix. Three options in increasing scope:

1. **Documentation + verification gate (recommended for BUG-008.2).** Add a smoke-test on the reference fixture set that prints the offline BPM alongside the metadata-tag BPM for each track. When they disagree by > 3 %, log a `WARN` to `session.log`. No runtime behaviour change. Surfaces the upstream-model failure mode without acting on it.
2. **Cross-validation layer.** Run a second, independent BPM estimator (Phosphene's existing DSP.1 trimmed-mean IOI on sub_bass) over the preview audio at preparation time. When the two estimators disagree by > 3 % AND the IOI estimator's confidence is high, prefer the IOI estimate. Adds ~5 ms per track and a knob (the agreement threshold). Does not fix the structural problem (still one BPM for the whole track).
3. **Drift tracker re-estimates BPM.** Modify `LiveBeatDriftTracker` so accumulated drift over N consecutive beats triggers a beat-period re-estimate from the live onset stream. Structurally correct but a non-trivial change to S7 invariants. Should not be folded into BUG-008; track separately.

Recommended for BUG-008.2: option (1) only. Defer (2)/(3) until **BUG-007** (lock-hysteresis) is closed — drift behaviour is hard to reason about on top of a separate lock bug. With BUG-007 closed and option (1) active, manual validation on Love Rehab will tell us whether the upstream-model BPM is "wrong enough that lock fails" or "merely qualitatively different from the metadata tag in a way that doesn't affect lock."

**Related:** BUG-006.2 (exposed this latent issue end-to-end), DSP.2 S5 (introduced offline BeatGrid resolver), BUG-007 (compounds with — even a perfectly accurate grid wouldn't lock cleanly while BUG-007 is open), Failed Approach #52 (sample-rate plumbing — explicitly ruled out by this diagnosis; the 22050 Hz literal in `BeatThisPreprocessor` is the model's training rate, correctly allowlisted).

### BUG-004 — All production presets have `certified: false`

**Severity:** P3
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** V.6 (certification pipeline introduced; no presets had passed M7 yet)
**Resolved:** 2026-05-12 — Phase LM (Lumen Mosaic cert flip at LM.7) + BUG-004 closure increment (this commit)

**Root cause:** Quality bar — not a code defect. The certification rubric (V.6 / D-067) and orchestrator filter (`includeUncertifiedPresets: false` default) were correct; no preset had yet survived a Matt M7 visual review against its curated reference set.

**Fix:** Two-part landing.

1. **Cert flip (Phase LM, LM.7 — 2026-05-12).** Lumen Mosaic's LM.4.6 + LM.6 + LM.7 final shape (pure uniform random RGB per cell + cell-depth gradient + per-track chromatic-projected RGB tint) cleared the rubric with **10.5 / 15** (mandatory 7/7 + expected 2.5/4 + preferred 1/4). Matt M7 sign-off recorded against real-music session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`: *"Fix has achieved the desired effect — each track now has a visually distinct color palette ... I think we can move to certify this preset."* `LumenMosaic.json` flipped to `"certified": true`. `"Lumen Mosaic"` added to `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`. Phosphene's **first production certified preset** — Milestone D progresses to **1 / 22+**.
2. **Closure verification (BUG-004 commit, this session).** Three follow-up items addressed:
   - **`GoldenSessionTests.makeRealCatalog()` expanded 11 → 15 production presets.** Pre-closure the fixture was a stale subset that didn't include Lumen Mosaic, Arachne, Gossamer, or Staged Sandbox. Now mirrors every production sidecar. Spectral Cartograph + Staged Sandbox carry `isDiagnostic: true` per D-074 so the orchestrator excludes them categorically. Session C track 5 moved Plasma → Ferrofluid Ocean post-expansion (Plasma's high `fatigue_risk` cooldown extends past track 5's start; FO is the next-best high-energy candidate). Sessions A + B unchanged.
   - **Session D added** — a single-track 180 s fixture with BPM=75 / valence=0.0 / arousal=+0.30 (LM-favourable mood profile). New test `sessionD_lumenMosaicWinsFirstSegment` regression-locks LM winning track 0 / segment 0 under that mood; scoring trace documents LM at total ≈ 0.868 vs Gossamer 0.830 / Arachne 0.818 / Plasma 0.796 / GB 0.787. Demonstrates the cert is end-to-end exercised, not just structurally present.
   - **MatIDDispatch test fixture stale-constant fix.** `MatIDDispatchTests.kLumenEmissionGain` updated 4.0 → 1.0 to match the LM.3.2 round-4 emission-gain reduction (2026-05-10). All 3 MatIDDispatch tests now pass.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] **Manual:** Matt M7 review approved Lumen Mosaic at LM.7 (session `2026-05-12T17-15-14Z`).
- [x] **Automated:** `GoldenSessionTests` (13 tests, including Session D) passes with at least one certified preset (Lumen Mosaic) producing non-zero orchestrator selections under a plausible mood profile.

**Carry-forward:**
- Phosphene now runs with one certified preset by default. The orchestrator no longer requires `includeUncertifiedPresets: true` for sessions to produce non-empty plans, but the catalog still has 14 uncertified production presets. Watch for over-/under-selection of Lumen Mosaic in real-use sessions — that would indicate a scoring-rebalance follow-up (QR.2-class), not a cert-flip defect.
- Next cert candidates per CLAUDE.md ordering: Arachne V.7.10 (blocked on V.7.7C.5.2 manual smoke + V.7.7C.6 spider movement + BUG-011 perf capture); Aurora Veil (Phase AV — design + references ready, sequenced behind Arachne).

**Related:** V.6, V.7.10, D-067 (cert pipeline), LM.7 sign-off in `docs/presets/LUMEN_MOSAIC_DESIGN.md §10`, D-074 (diagnostic exclusion).

### BUG-R001 — BeatGrid finite horizon caused PLANNED·LOCKED never reached

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** DSP.2 S7 (BeatGrid first used without horizon extrapolation)
**Resolved:** DSP.3.4 — commit `7033ad09`

**Root cause:** `BeatGrid.offsetBy` only shifted the ~10 recorded beats. Past the last beat, `computePhase` clamped `beatPhase01=1.0` permanently and `nearestBeat` returned nil → `consecutiveMisses` incremented every onset → `matchedOnsets` never reached `lockThreshold=4`. Diagnostic evidence: session `2026-05-05T21-13-05Z` showed 12,509 frames in LOCKING, 0 in LOCKED.

**Fix:** `offsetBy(seconds:horizon:)` now appends extrapolated beats at `period=60/bpm` up to a 300-second horizon.

### BUG-R002 — Hardcoded 44100 Hz sample rate in Beat This! call

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** DSP.2 S9 (live Beat This! trigger)
**Resolved:** DSP.3.4 — commit `7033ad09` (Beat This! site only)
**Generalized:** QR.1 (D-079) — every remaining live-tap consumer threaded; literal `44100` CI-banned via `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh`; `tapSampleRate` now NSLock-guarded for cross-core visibility.

**Root cause:** `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded` passed `sampleRate: 44100` to `analyzeBeatGrid` regardless of actual tap rate (48000 Hz). The mel spectrogram covered the wrong time range; BPM resolved as ~216 instead of ~125. The QR.1 multi-agent review (Architect H1; Audio+DSP D1; ML #1+#2) found four more live-tap consumers with the same bug pattern (stem separator dispatch, per-frame stem analysis sample rate, StemSampleBuffer init, StemAnalyzer init default).

**Fix:** DSP.3.4 fixed the Beat This! call site. QR.1 closes the bug class by threading `tapSampleRate` through every live-tap consumer in `PhospheneApp`, NSLock-guarding the field, allowlisting legitimate `44100` literals (StemSeparator.modelSampleRate, BeatThisPreprocessor.sourceSampleRate, default-arg boilerplate), and adding `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` to fail loud on any future regression.

---

### BUG-R003 — StemSampleBuffer snapshot undersized at 48000 Hz

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** DSP.2 S9
**Resolved:** DSP.3.4 — commit `7033ad09` (Beat This! call site only)
**Generalized:** QR.1 (D-079) — added `rms(seconds:sampleRate:)` overload; both rate-aware overloads now used at every consumer; covered by `TapSampleRateRegressionTests` so the buffer never silently falls back to its stored default again.

**Root cause:** `snapshotLatest(seconds:)` computed sample count using stored 44100 Hz init rate — a 10-second request retrieved only 9.19 s of real audio. DSP.3.4 added the rate-aware `snapshotLatest(seconds:sampleRate:)` overload but only used it at the Beat This! call site; `performStemSeparation` still used the no-rate overload.

**Fix:** DSP.3.4 added the rate-aware snapshot overload. QR.1 added a matching `rms(seconds:sampleRate:)` overload, threaded both through `performStemSeparation`, and added `TapSampleRateRegressionTests` proving the rate-aware paths return the correct sample count on a 48 kHz tap regardless of buffer init rate.

### BUG-R004 — Live Beat This! returns double-time BPM on short window

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** DSP.2 S9 (live Beat This! trigger — no octave correction)
**Resolved:** DSP.3.5 — commit `eac2e140`

**Root cause:** 10-second window at 125 BPM gives ~20 beats. Beat This! correctly detected the density but measured the doubled onset pattern, returning 244.770 BPM.

**Fix:** `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()` halves BPM > 160 and drops every other beat recursively; applied before `offsetBy()`.

---

### BUG-R005 — IOI band fusion and histogram-mode picking biased tempo high

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Original `BeatDetector` implementation
**Resolved:** DSP.1 — commit `bbad760f`

**Root cause:** Two independent bugs: (a) `recordOnsetTimestamps` fused sub_bass + low_bass onset events, producing frame-aliased alternating 18/19-frame IOIs for a true 441 ms beat; (b) histogram-mode BPM picking used integer-rounded buckets with non-uniform widths in period space, biasing toward faster BPMs. See Failed Approaches #50 and #51.

**Fix:** Single-band sourcing from `result.onsets[0]` only; replaced histogram-mode with trimmed-mean IOI in `computeRobustBPM`.

### BUG-R006 — Sample-rate plumbing audit (QR.1)

**Severity:** P1
**Domain tag:** dsp.audio
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Multi-source — DSP.2 S9 added new sites; DSP.3.4 fixed only the Beat This! call site, leaving four other live-tap consumers using the literal `44100`.
**Resolved:** QR.1 — D-079, commits `(see git log [QR.1])`.

**Root cause:** Failed Approach #52: five `PhospheneApp` sites consumed live tap audio at the literal `sampleRate: 44100`. On a 48 kHz tap (the macOS Audio MIDI Setup default) every site silently produced wrong-rate data — stems were 8.8 % time-stretched and pitch-shifted before separation, biasing every downstream stem-feature analysis. Compound with `tapSampleRate` mutated from the audio thread without a synchronization barrier — cross-core visibility for an unsynchronized 8-byte field is not guaranteed on Apple Silicon, producing wrong-tempo grids ~1-in-1000 sessions invisible in tests.

**Fix:** (1) Captured `tapSampleRate` once per tap install through an NSLock-guarded accessor (`updateTapSampleRate(_:)` writer, `tapSampleRate` reader). (2) Threaded `tapSampleRate` through every live-tap consumer (`performStemSeparation` snapshot/rms/separate, live Beat This! snapshot — already DSP.3.4-fixed). (3) Replaced literal `44100` in non-tap-consuming code with `StemSeparator.modelSampleRate`. (4) Added `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` to fail loud on any future regression. (5) Added `TapSampleRateRegressionTests` covering the rate-aware `StemSampleBuffer` API.

**Verification:** `swift test --filter TapSampleRateRegression` passes. `bash Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` exits 0.

### BUG-R007 — Tempo octave correction policy split between halving-only and halving+doubling

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** dsp.beat
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Original `BeatDetector+Tempo.swift` implementation
**Resolved:** QR.1 — D-079, commits `(see git log [QR.1])`.

**Root cause:** `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected()` (DSP.3.5) is halving-only by design — Pyramid Song genuinely runs at ~68 BPM and any track in [40, 80) BPM must survive. But `BeatDetector+Tempo.computeRobustBPM` and `BeatDetector+Tempo.estimateTempo` retained `if bpm < 80 { bpm *= 2 }` branches that doubled any sub-80 estimate to 150. The split policy meant a track resolving to 70 BPM via the IOI path got reported as 140 BPM in `instantBPM`/`estimatedTempo` while the prepared-grid path (when available) stayed correct at 70.

**Fix:** Deleted the sub-80 doubling branch in both `computeRobustBPM` and `estimateTempo`. Halving (`bpm > 160 → /2`) preserved. Added `tempo_75BPMKick_returnsNear75_notDoubled` and `tempo_68BPMKick_pyramidSongPreservedNotDoubled` to `BeatDetectorTests`.

**Verification:** `swift test --filter "tempo_75BPM|tempo_68BPM"` passes.

### BUG-R008 — `MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` Float-precision long-session drift

**Severity:** P3
**Domain tag:** dsp.audio
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Original `MIRPipeline` implementation
**Resolved:** QR.1 — D-079, commits `(see git log [QR.1])`.

**Root cause:** `elapsedSeconds: Float` was incremented by `+= deltaTime` every frame. After 30 minutes of accumulation, ULP ≈ 240 µs — smaller than the ±30 ms tight-match window in `LiveBeatDriftTracker` but a guaranteed monotonic drift over hours of listening. Pre-existing, never observed in production because session lengths in test fixtures are < 1 minute.

**Fix:** `elapsedSeconds` (and `lastOnsetRateTime` / `lastRecordTime`) promoted to `Double`. Consumers cast to `Float` once at the FeatureVector / CSV write site. `LiveBeatDriftTracker.update(playbackTime:)` parameter widened to `Double`. New `elapsedSeconds_typeIsDouble` and `elapsedSeconds_accumulatesAsDouble_isMoreAccurateThanFloat` tests in `MIRPipelineUnitTests`.

**Verification:** `swift test --filter elapsedSeconds_` passes.

### BUG-R009 — KineticSculpture sminK violated D-026 (raw AGC-energy thresholding)

**Severity:** P3
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Original `KineticSculpture.metal` implementation
**Resolved:** QR.1 — D-079, commits `(see git log [QR.1])`.

**Root cause:** Mercury melt smooth-union radius read `0.06 + f.sub_bass * 0.28 + f.bass * 0.10` — raw AGC-normalized energy with an arbitrary 2.8× weight on a sub-band that is rarely populated in real tracks. Failed Approach #31 / D-026.

**Fix:** Replaced with `0.06 + f.bass * 0.16 + f.bass_dev * 0.05` — continuous bass band (Layer 1) drives the baseline; bass deviation adds the per-onset accent. Stays within the "beat ≤ 2× continuous" rule from `PresetAcceptanceTests`. Golden hashes regenerated; original steady/quiet hashes unchanged within dHash tolerance, beatHeavy shifted slightly (deviation now contributes a small `+0.06` to sminK).

**Verification:** `swift test --filter "PresetAcceptance|PresetRegression"` passes.

### BUG-R010 — PitchTracker `vocalsPitchConfidence` structurally 0 due to live-path zero-padding (PT.1 retroactive)

**Severity:** P1 (visible — Aurora Veil's vocals-pitch route had 0% firing across every session for ~5 months; same root cause would have affected any future vocals-pitch preset).
**Domain tag:** dsp.pitch
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Original `PitchTracker.swift` implementation (MV-3c, D-028, 2026-04-17).
**Resolved:** PT.1, 2026-05-19 (logged in `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` `[PT.1]` block + Aurora Veil AV.2 closeout narrative). **Retroactive `Resolved` entry filed by Phase CA.1 audit on 2026-05-20** per CLAUDE.md Defect Handling Protocol obligation that every fix increment update `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. The PT.1 increment shipped without a `BUG-` entry — this row closes that gap.

**Root cause:** The live caller (`StemAnalyzer`) passes 1024-sample windows to `PitchTracker.process(_:)`. The pre-fix implementation copied the input into the first half of an internal 2048-sample buffer and zero-padded the second half. The YIN difference function is `d[τ] = vDSP_dotpr(x[0..1024], x[τ..τ+1024])` — with the second half all zeros, the cross-correlation was structurally zero for every τ, the CMNDF never dipped below the 0.15 threshold, `findMinimum` always returned -1, and the method always returned `(hz: 0, confidence: 0)`.

**Why it survived ~5 months undetected.** `PitchTrackerTests` passes full 2048-sample windows directly to `process`, so the test never exercised the live-incremental code path. Same test/prod parity failure mode that the Aurora Veil AV.1 / AV.2 / AV.2.1 cascade hit (CLAUDE.md: "Test in the production-grade rendering pipeline. No shortcuts"). Pre-PT.1 closeouts that asserted Aurora Veil's vocals-pitch route was working were citing self-judgment, not measured route-firing rates — the diagnostic infrastructure to verify the claim (now `PresetSessionReplay` / SR.1) did not exist.

**Fix:** `PitchTracker.swift` rewritten to (a) maintain a 2048-sample ring buffer via `appendToRingBuffer(_:)` (lines 178–212), (b) track `samplesAccumulated` and only run YIN once it reaches `windowSize` (guard at lines 137–139), (c) shift the ring left and append for sub-window inputs. Live 1024-sample inputs now accumulate across two consecutive calls before YIN runs, instead of being zero-padded.

**Expected behavior:** On real vocals input, `vocalsPitchConfidence > 0.5` fires at a non-trivial rate (~20–25 % of frames per Aurora Veil session data). On silence, returns `(0, 0)` correctly.

**Actual behavior post-fix:** `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md:3858` records "Route 1 vocals melody → hue ... 23.28 % (was 0 % pre-PT.1)" — measured from `features.csv` across a real Aurora Veil session.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] Source-level: ring-buffer fill guard at `PitchTracker.swift:137-139`; incremental append at `:178-212`.
- [x] Empirical: Route-firing rate ≥ 5 % on a real vocals-bearing track (Aurora Veil session log).
- [ ] **Test-surface gap (acknowledged):** existing `PitchTrackerTests` still pass full 2048-sample windows directly. A live-incremental-path regression test that exercises the 1024-sample append behavior end-to-end has not yet been written. Filing as follow-up work; not a blocker for this entry's `Resolved` status because empirical evidence from production replay covers the gap.

**Confirmed failure class:** `pipeline-wiring` (zero-padding instead of accumulating across calls).

### QR.2 — Stem-affinity scoring AGC saturation + reactive-mode TrackProfile adversarial penalty

**Severity:** P2 (orchestrator correctness; affected every Spotify/Apple Music session)
**Domain tag:** orchestrator
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** Increment 4.1 (PresetScorer original implementation)
**Resolved:** QR.2 (D-080) — 2026-05-06.

**Root cause (Issue #1):** `stemAffinitySubScore` accumulated raw AGC-normalized energies across declared affinities (`clamp(sum(stemEnergy[i]))`) and clamped to [0,1]. AGC centers each energy field at ~0.5; any preset declaring 2+ stems trivially saturated at ~1.0 on most music. Two presets with disjoint affinities ("drums" vs "vocals") both scored ~1.0 on a track where only drums were active. The 25% stem-affinity weight did no discriminative work.

**Root cause (Issue #2):** `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` built scoring contexts with `TrackProfile.empty`, whose `stemEnergyBalance == StemFeatures.zero`. Under the deviation formula, zero balance → devSum = 0 → score = 0 for ALL stem-affinity-bearing presets. Neutral presets (no affinities declared) scored 0.5 always. The most musically-engaged catalog members were adversarially penalized in the most common use case (reactive ad-hoc listening since U.3). Failed Approach #54.

**Fix:** `stemAffinitySubScore` rewritten to use `stemEnergyDev[stem]` (deviation primitives, D-026/MV-1) and compute `mean(max(0, dev))` over declared stems. Zero-balance guard returns neutral 0.5 when `stemEnergyBalance == .zero`. `DefaultLiveAdapter` converted to class with 30 s per-track mood-override cooldown. Boundary-switch gate tightened with `minBoundaryScoreGap = 0.05`. `cutEnergyThreshold` raised 0.7 → 0.85. `recentHistory` capped at 50. Live `StemFeatures` wired into reactive mode after 10 s. D-080.

**Consequence for planned sessions:** Pre-analyzed `TrackProfile.stemEnergyBalance` has dev≈0 (EMA converged over 30-second preview); stem affinity is neutral (0.5) for all presets in planned-session scoring. Golden session sequences updated in `GoldenSessionTests.swift` — VL no longer wins on a stem bonus.

**Verification:** `swift test --filter StemAffinityScoring && swift test --filter GoldenSession && swift test --filter LiveAdapter` — all pass. 1084 total engine tests, 1 pre-existing flake (MetadataPreFetcher network timeout).

### BUG-002 — PresetVisualReviewTests PNG export broken for staged presets

**Severity:** P2
**Domain tag:** preset.fidelity
**Status:** Resolved
**Introduced:** V.7.7A (staged-composition scaffold)
**Resolved:** 2026-05-07 by QR.3 (commit on `[QR.3] tests: integration / connector / ML golden + docs`).

**Note:** Moved from Open section to Resolved section by `[V.7.7B prep]` 2026-05-07 — entry was already marked Resolved but physically remained in Open, the documentation drift the V.7.7B prep prompt corrected.

**Expected behavior:** `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter PresetVisualReviewTests` produces per-stage PNG contact sheets for Arachne (and any other staged preset) under `/tmp/phosphene_visual/<timestamp>/`.

**Actual behavior:** The export throws `cgImageFailed` for any staged preset's PNG output. Non-staged presets are unaffected.

**Reproduction steps:**
1. `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter PresetVisualReviewTests`
2. Observe `cgImageFailed` error for Arachne (staged); other presets export normally.

**Minimum reproducer:** Any staged preset under `RENDER_VISUAL=1`.

**Session artifacts:** Console output from the test run.

**Suspected failure class:** pipeline-wiring
**Evidence:** `PresetVisualReviewTests.makeBGRAPipeline` calls `Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Shaders")` from the test target bundle (which has no Shaders resource). Staged presets require the `arachne_world_fragment` and `arachne_composite_fragment` functions which live in `Bundle(for: PresetLoader.self)`. The source lookup fails before the pipeline is built.

**Verification criteria:**
- [x] `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter PresetVisualReviewTests` produces at least one PNG per stage for Arachne without `cgImageFailed` — verified at QR.3 land time, 16 PNGs across 5 preset cases (Arachne / Gossamer / Volumetric Lithograph non-staged + Staged Sandbox + Arachne staged).
- [x] Per-stage tiles emitted: `Arachne_silence_world.png`, `Arachne_silence_composite.png`, etc.

**Fix scope:** Initial plan was `Bundle(for: PresetLoader.self)` but that does not work in SPM (library targets statically link into the test executable, so `Bundle(for:)` resolves to the test bundle, not the Presets bundle). Resolved by adding `public static var PresetLoader.bundledShadersURL: URL?` that returns `Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Shaders", ...)` from inside the Presets module (where `Bundle.module` resolves correctly), and pointing `makeBGRAPipeline` at it.

**Related:** V.7.7A, D-072, D-090.
