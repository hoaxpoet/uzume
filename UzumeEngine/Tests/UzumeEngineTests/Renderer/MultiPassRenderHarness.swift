// MultiPassRenderHarness — the shared headless render of every certified preset's REAL
// multi-pass / feedback / follower path, driven by an INJECTED per-frame train and a
// generic per-frame pixel reducer.
//
// Extracted from MultiPassFlashHarnessTests (CLEAN.7.6c) at QG.3.1 so two consumers share
// ONE faithful render (FA #66 — drive the live paths, never reimplement):
//   - the photosensitivity flash gate drives a synthetic worst-case beat train and reduces
//     each frame to WCAG relative luminance (flash-rate analysis);
//   - the QG.3 coupling report drives the REAL reconstructed-fixture train (FA #27) and
//     reduces each frame to a luma field (frame-to-frame visual delta vs. energy).
//
// The render bodies are byte-identical to the pre-extraction flash harness — the mv_warp
// feedback swap, the rayMarch 128-step budget, the ticked followers, the settle windows.
// A change here changes BOTH gates; keep the live-path fidelity notes intact.
