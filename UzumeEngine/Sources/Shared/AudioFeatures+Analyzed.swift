// MARK: - FeatureVector

/// Packed per-frame audio features for GPU uniform upload.
///
/// This is the primary struct that shaders receive every frame, bound at `buffer(0)`.
/// 52 floats = 208 bytes. Fields follow the
/// audio data hierarchy: continuous energy first, spectral features second, onset pulses
/// third, deviation primitives fourth.
///
/// **ORDER IS THE CONTRACT, and it is stated in exactly three places — none of them here.**
/// This doc comment used to carry a fourth copy of the MSL struct; it had drifted to "48
/// floats = 192 bytes" and listed fields only through 48, i.e. it was wrong by two
/// increments and nothing caught it, because no gate reads prose. Removed at FTR.6 rather
/// than re-synced. The authoritative declarations are:
///
/// - this Swift struct;
/// - `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift` (runtime-compiled preset shaders);
/// - `Renderer/Shaders/Common.metal` (engine-library shaders).
///
/// `CommonLayoutTest` parses the latter two and asserts they agree with each other AND with
/// `MemoryLayout<FeatureVector>.size`, field name by field name. Append only, keep the
/// stride a multiple of 16, and update all three in one commit.
