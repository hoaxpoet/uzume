# Uzume — Runbook

## Preconditions

- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Apple Silicon Mac (M1+)
- **Xcode 26.5** with Command Line Tools — pinned in [`.xcode-version`](../.xcode-version) (CLEAN.5.4a); CI selects this exact version, not "newest installed". The real floor is the **Xcode 26 SDK**, not the OS: it marks the Metal protocol types (`MTLDevice`/`MTLCommandQueue`/`MTLRenderPipelineState`) `Sendable`, which the codebase stores in `Sendable` types; Xcode 16 does not (build SDK ≠ deployment target — the 26 SDK still targets macOS 14.0). Bump location: `.xcode-version` + the CI `runs-on` image.
- **SwiftLint 0.63.2** — pinned in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`SWIFTLINT_VERSION`; CLEAN.5.4b). Match it locally; `brew install swiftlint` floats to latest (0.63.3 drifted the `force_unwrapping` rule and red-built CI). Bump both together.
- Screen capture permission for live audio capture
- Swift 6.0 language mode (Xcode 26.5 toolchain ships Swift 6.3.x), Metal 3.1+

> **Security posture & local threat model:** [`SECURITY_POSTURE.md`](SECURITY_POSTURE.md) — why the app is un-sandboxed, the system-audio tap scope + consent gate, hardened-runtime/notarization status (filed CLEAN.2.5 for distribution), the `uzume://` OAuth callback, the local-file parsing surface, and the no-telemetry posture. Read it before changing any signing/entitlement/tap setting.

## Spotify connector setup (U.11 — OAuth PKCE)

Uzume uses Spotify's Authorization Code + PKCE flow (user-level OAuth). The user logs in once via their system browser; the refresh token is stored in the macOS Keychain and used silently on subsequent launches.

**One-time developer setup:**

1. Go to [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.
2. Click **Create app**. Name it "Uzume". Add redirect URI: **`uzume://spotify-callback`** (exact, required). Check **Web API**. Accept terms.
3. Copy the **Client ID** from the app dashboard. (No client secret is needed for PKCE.)
4. Create `UzumeApp/Uzume.local.xcconfig` (gitignored) with:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = your_client_id_here
   ```
5. Build. No Xcode configuration change is needed: both `Debug` and `Release` already point at `Uzume.xcconfig` (`baseConfigurationReference`, `UzumeApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`), and that file ends with `#include? "Uzume.local.xcconfig"` — creating the file is sufficient.

The app reads `SpotifyClientID` at runtime via `Bundle.main.infoDictionary`. An empty or missing Client ID causes every Spotify connect attempt to throw `.spotifyAuthFailure` immediately.

**`Uzume.local.xcconfig` is gitignored, so it does not survive `git clean -fdx`, a fresh clone, or a new worktree.** Re-create it (step 4) whenever Spotify connect starts failing in a tree that used to work. In a DEBUG build the connector says so directly — "No Spotify Client ID in this build…" — rather than the generic auth-failure copy a shipped build shows.

**User flow (end-user, one-time):**

1. Paste a Spotify playlist URL in the connector view.
2. Uzume shows "Log in with Spotify" if not yet authenticated.
3. Tap "Log in with Spotify" → system browser opens `accounts.spotify.com/authorize`.
4. User approves → browser redirects to `uzume://spotify-callback?code=…`.
5. Uzume exchanges the code for tokens; refresh token stored in Keychain.
6. Future sessions skip the login step (silent token refresh).

**Logout:** Not yet exposed in the Settings UI. Developer workaround: delete the Keychain item via Keychain Access.app → search "io.uzume.spotify".


### Spotify connector gotchas — relocated from CLAUDE.md §Failed Approaches (DOC.3b, 2026-05-13)

Three connector-implementation lessons relocated to live next to the Spotify setup instructions. Original CLAUDE.md numbering preserved for cross-reference.

**CLAUDE.md #45 — Assuming the Spotify `/items` response JSON schema is unchanged from `/tracks`.** The Spotify Web API documentation is authoritative. When `/tracks` was deprecated and replaced by `/items`, the response schema changed: each `PlaylistTrackObject` now uses `"item"` as the key for the track/episode object. The old `"track"` key is deprecated. Code that reads `item["track"]` from `/items` responses returns `nil` for every item and silently produces an empty track list. Always check current Spotify Web API reference docs before implementing or modifying connector parsing logic. Confirmed by console log: `hasItem=true hasTrack=false`. **Note (QR.3, 2026-05-07):** `SpotifyItemsSchemaTests` regression-locks this against an on-disk fixture (`Fixtures/spotify_items_response.json`) — if the parser ever falls back to reading only `"track"`, the test fails with `Track A`/`B`/`C` count = 0.

**CLAUDE.md #46 — Using the `fields` query parameter on Spotify's `/items` endpoint.** Field filtering (`fields=items(track(name,artists,...))`) causes the `/items` endpoint to silently return empty dictionaries `{}` for any item whose track data does not exactly match the filter. The result: `items` is a non-empty array of `{}` objects, `compactMap` returns zero tracks, and the session falls back to reactive mode with no error. The root cause is invisible — the API responds 200 with correct `total` and item count but empty item bodies. Fix: omit the `fields` parameter entirely. Use `market=from_token` instead to handle region-restricted tracks, which can otherwise return null track objects.

**CLAUDE.md #47 — Discarding the Spotify `preview_url` field and then calling iTunes Search API to find it.** Spotify's `/items` response includes `preview_url` directly in each `TrackObject` — a CDN URL for the 30-second MP3 preview. Throwing this away and then querying iTunes Search API to find the same URL (at 20 req/min, with fuzzy text matching that can miss tracks) wastes a round-trip and causes false "Preview not available" results. Store `preview_url` on `TrackIdentity` as a hint field excluded from `Equatable`/`Hashable`/`Codable`, and short-circuit `PreviewResolver` when it is present. Tracks where Spotify returns `null` for `preview_url` (rights-restricted, like some Mclusky tracks) genuinely have no preview — fall through to iTunes for those.

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build

# Package tests (UzumeEngine SPM target)
swift test --package-path UzumeEngine

# App tests (app test target only — engine tests run via swift test above)
xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp -destination 'platform=macOS' test

# Lint
swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml
```

**The app scheme's test action runs only `UzumeAppTests` (BUG-048).** From U.1 until 2026-06-11 it also ran the engine test bundle, which fails under xcodebuild's test-runner context on environment, not code: ffmpeg subprocess spawning and repo-relative file reads are denied ("Operation not permitted"), audio-device tests die instantly, and only ~440 of the engine suite's 1439 tests even load. The engine suite's canonical runner is `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine`, where all of those pass. `SchemeTestActionRegressionTests` (engine suite) fails loudly if the engine bundle is re-added to the scheme's test action.

**Quit Uzume before running the app test suite (BUG-072).** The test *host* is `Uzume.app` itself, and `Info.plist` sets `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` (U.11, for OAuth callback routing) — so while any `io.uzume.mac` process is running, LaunchServices refuses the host launch and the whole run fails at exit 65 with "Could not launch “UzumeAppTests”", zero tests executed. It survives every build-side remedy (clean, `lsregister`, bundle delete, a different worktree or DerivedData path) because the blocker is a *running process*, not a build product. Fix:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application id "io.uzume.mac" to quit'; pkill -x Uzume
```

Address it **by bundle id**. At RN.1 the product became `Uzume.app` with executable
`Uzume`, so the pre-rename incantations (`tell application "PhospheneApp"`,
`pkill -x PhospheneApp`) silently match nothing and leave the blocker running — the
next test run then fails for a reason the command you just ran appeared to rule out.
If a wedged instance ignores `quit` outright, `kill -9 <pid>` from
`pgrep -f 'Uzume.app/Contents/MacOS'` is the escape hatch.

`Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` annotates the evidence block when it sees this signature, so it is never mistaken for a real app-test regression.

### After the Uzume rename (RN.1) — one-time, per machine

The bundle identifier changed from `com.phosphene.app` to `io.uzume.mac`. macOS keys
several things to that identifier, so a machine that ran the pre-rename build needs
three one-time steps. Everything else migrates itself on first launch.

**1. Re-grant Screen Recording.** TCC grants belong to the old identifier and cannot be
transferred — the old grant is orphaned, which is expected, not a bug. Without this the
tap installs and delivers silent zeros with no error (the §"App captures silence" trap).
Reset both identifiers so no stale row shadows the new one, then relaunch and grant when
prompted:

```bash
tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.phosphene.app; tccutil reset ScreenCapture io.uzume.mac
```

Confirm `Signal: Active` in the debug overlay within 1.5 s of audio starting. Apple
Events and Apple Music prompts re-appear on first use for the same reason.

**2. Reconnect Spotify.** The OAuth refresh token stays in the login keychain under
`com.phosphene.spotify`, and the new code identity has no ACL on it. Adopting it was
tried and reverted: reading another identity's item raises a modal `SecurityAgent`
prompt, and because the store is built from a stored-property initializer that
**blocks app launch** — the app wedges before `init()` runs and the XCTest runner never
connects. One OAuth click is the cheaper trade. Reconnect in Settings → Connectors.

If a stale `io.uzume.spotify` item exists from an earlier experiment, delete it or every
launch will hang on that dialog:

```bash
security delete-generic-password -s io.uzume.spotify ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

**3. Update the Spotify redirect URI — on Spotify's side.** This one is not in the repo and
no sweep can fix it. The app now sends `uzume://spotify-callback`, but an app registration
created before the rename still whitelists `phosphene://spotify-callback`, and Spotify rejects
the login with **"redirect_uri: Not matching configuration"** *after* the user has already typed
their password — so it reads like a credentials failure rather than a config one. On
developer.spotify.com/dashboard → your app → Settings → Redirect URIs, add
`uzume://spotify-callback`. Leaving the old entry alongside it is harmless and keeps a
pre-rename build working.

**4. Nothing to do for settings or the stem cache.** `IdentityMigrator` runs at launch and
carries the UserDefaults domain plus `~/Library/Application Support/Phosphene` →
`.../Uzume` (the stem cache — hundreds of MB, each entry an ML separation pass). It is
idempotent and never overwrites a value already set under the new identity.

### After the internal rename (RN.2) — one-time, per checkout

RN.2 renamed the directories, so anything holding an absolute path into the old tree is
stale. None of this migrates itself.

**1. Delete the SPM build caches.** `git mv` moves untracked files too, so
`UzumeEngine/.build` arrived under the new name still recording the old one. The symptom is
`precompiled file … was compiled with module cache path …/PhospheneEngine/.build/…, but the
path is currently …/UzumeEngine/.build/…` followed by `missing required module 'SwiftShims'`.

```bash
rm -rf UzumeEngine/.build UzumeTools/.build
```

**2. Expect a new DerivedData directory.** Xcode hashes it from the project path, so the build
lands in `UzumeApp-<newhash>` and the old `PhospheneApp-*` directories are dead weight. Prune
them — and never glob `DerivedData/*App-*` when launching a built app, or you will run a stale
binary (memory `feedback_never_glob_deriveddata`).

**3. Worktrees created before RN.2 cannot be served fixtures.**
`Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` resolves the gitignored trees against the **primary** checkout by
path, so while `main` still holds `PhospheneEngine/`, a renamed worktree asks for
`UzumeEngine/Tests/Fixtures` and gets a hard `required tree is EMPTY in the primary checkout`
error. This clears the moment RN.2 lands on `main`; until then a worktree that was renamed by
`git mv` already carries its fixtures and needs no linking.

**4. Recreate `UzumeApp/Uzume.local.xcconfig`** if Spotify connect starts failing — it is
gitignored, and the file you had was named `Phosphene.local.xcconfig`. Same contents (see
§Spotify connector setup step 4).

### Renaming the checkout directory itself — `Projects/phosphene` → `Projects/uzume`

Not done by RN.2 or RN.3, and **not a repository operation**: nothing tracked in
either repo depends on the directory name (the only absolute-path references are
in `docs/diagnostics/` and `prompts/`, which are frozen captures of past runs).
It is a workstation migration, and it cannot be run from a shell whose working
directory is inside the tree being moved.

Three things break, and the second one is the expensive surprise:

1. **Every worktree's git linkage.** Each worktree's `.git` file holds an
   absolute `gitdir:` into `Projects/phosphene/.git/worktrees/<name>`, and each
   admin `gitdir` file points back out at the worktree. There were 11 worktrees
   at RN.3, and **two live outside the tree** (`~/.claude-worktrees/…`,
   `~/.codex/worktrees/…`) so they do not move with it. `git worktree repair`
   fixes both directions but must be told about the external ones.
2. **Claude Code's per-project state.** Session transcripts and the project
   memory store live in `~/.claude/projects/<slugified-cwd>/`. At RN.3 that was
   25 directories rooted at `-Users-braesidebandit-Documents-Projects-phosphene`,
   including `…/memory/` with the whole memory index. Rename the checkout without
   renaming these and a new session looks for a `…-uzume` slug, finds nothing, and
   **silently loses all project memory and history** — no error, just an empty
   store. Rename them in the same sitting.
3. **DerivedData** re-hashes to a new `UzumeApp-*` directory. Harmless; prune the
   orphan.

Sequence — from a shell **outside** the tree, with no Claude Code or Xcode
sessions open on it:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Projects
mv phosphene uzume
git -C uzume worktree repair
git -C uzume worktree repair ~/.claude-worktrees/meniscus-2a ~/.codex/worktrees/85ac/phosphene
git -C uzume worktree list          # every path resolves, no "prunable" entries
```

Then migrate Claude Code's per-project state. **Do not blind-`mv`:** the harness
creates the new-slug directory as soon as a session opens in the renamed tree, so
`mv old new` would nest the old directory *inside* the new one instead of
replacing it. **Copy the memory store, verify, then remove the old** — memory is
the irreplaceable part:

```bash
P=~/.claude/projects
O=$P/-Users-braesidebandit-Documents-Projects-phosphene
N=$P/-Users-braesidebandit-Documents-Projects-uzume
mkdir -p "$N/memory"
cp -Rn "$O/memory/." "$N/memory/"        # -n: never clobber a newer file
for f in "$O"/*.jsonl; do cp -n "$f" "$N/"; done
diff -r "$O/memory" "$N/memory" && echo IDENTICAL
```

Only after `IDENTICAL` should the old directory go. The per-worktree slugs
(`…-phosphene--claude-worktrees-*`) hold **session transcripts only, no memory**;
renaming them just preserves `/resume` for those worktrees and is optional.

**Repoint the fixture/weight symlinks — the step that actually fails the gate.**
`Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` populates a worktree's gitignored assets as **absolute**
symlinks into the primary checkout. Renaming the checkout dangles every one of
them, and the failure does not look like a path problem: `swift test` reports
dozens of *test failures* (`StemModelTests` cannot load weights, tempo fixtures
"do not exist"), which reads as a code regression. `link_fixtures.sh` cannot
repair it either, because after RN.2 it looks for `UzumeEngine/…` in a primary
still on pre-rename `main`. Repoint them in place:

```bash
OLD=/Users/braesidebandit/Documents/Projects/phosphene/PhospheneEngine
NEW=/Users/braesidebandit/Documents/Projects/uzume/PhospheneEngine
while IFS= read -r l; do t=$(readlink "$l"); case "$t" in "$OLD"*) ln -sfn "$NEW${t#$OLD}" "$l";; esac; done < <(find . -type l)
find . -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -print   # expect only .claude/skills/* (pre-existing)
```

That was 961 links in the RN.3 worktree. Adjust `NEW` to wherever the primary's
engine directory actually is — it stays `PhospheneEngine/` until RN.2 merges.

Finally: delete the stale `PhospheneApp-*` / `UzumeApp-*` DerivedData, and re-run
`Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` once from the renamed tree.

**Verified in practice, 2026-08-31.** The move was run without the repair step and
without the state migration. Consequence: all 8 nested worktrees plus the 2
external ones reported **`prunable`** in `git worktree list` — a `git worktree
prune` at that moment would have dropped every admin record. `git worktree repair`
with explicit paths fixed all 11; no commits were ever at risk (they live in the
main object store). The 84-file memory store was stranded under the old slug while
a fresh, empty `memory/` had already been created under the new one.

**Nothing changed about identity.** `PRODUCT_NAME` is still `Uzume`, the bundle is still
`Uzume.app` with bundle ID `io.uzume.mac`, and TCC grants, the keychain and the Spotify
redirect URI are untouched by RN.2 — the RN.1 steps above are not repeated.

**Do NOT pass `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES` on the command line.** It propagates to SPM dependencies and conflicts with `-suppress-warnings`. The flag is enforced per-target via `UzumeApp/Uzume.xcconfig`.

### Fast local tier — `Scripts/test_fast.sh` (CLEAN.7.2a)

For the inner dev loop, `Scripts/test_fast.sh` runs the pure-logic core — ~978 of the ~1,524 engine tests (DSP / Orchestrator / Shared / Session-logic / Audio-core / Doc gates) in ~13 s — skipping the GPU / ML / audio-fixture / visual / perf / integration / soak suites. It is **green in a worktree**: it excludes exactly the gitignored-fixture suites that fail loud when fixtures are absent, so it's the quickest "did I break the core logic" signal *without* running `fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh`.

It is **not the gate** — it's the local mirror of the CI fast gate (below). The full `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine` via `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` stays the merge/closeout gate and runs everything (GPU, ML, fixture, perf). For a tighter targeted loop, `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter <SuiteName>` runs exactly one suite. The skip-list is curated (exclusion by `--skip` regex, so a *new* heavy suite is not auto-skipped) — when you add a heavy GPU/ML/fixture/visual suite, add its name fragment to the relevant group in the script.

### Gate structure — CI fast gate vs manual closeout (CLEAN.5)

Two gates, deliberately split (Matt, 2026-06-15). Know which one enforces what:

**CI fast gate — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, automatic on push-to-`main` + every PR** (`runs-on: macos-26`). Required-green on `main`. *(This said `macos-14` until RECON.4, 2026-08-03 — a live-trap error, since the whole CLEAN.5.4a rationale is that macos-14's Xcode 16.2 SDK red-builds 18 Metal-Sendable errors. Anyone "restoring" macos-14 from this doc would break the gate.)* Runs only what's reliable on a headless GitHub runner:

- **Build** — `xcodebuild build` (app, `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`) + `swift build` (engine). Catches the #1 regression class — compile breaks — with no GPU.
- **SwiftLint** `--strict`.
- **Doc gate** — `DocIntegrityTests`.
- **Logic tests** — an explicit allow-list of GPU/fixture-free suites (Option A). It **under-covers by design**: a new pure-logic suite is not run until its filter is added to the workflow. (Filter strings match the test *type* name, e.g. `PresetScorer`, not the `@Suite("DefaultPresetScorer")` display string.)
- **Lints** — `check_user_strings.sh` + `check_sample_rate_literals.sh`. **Not** `check_blocking_calls_under_lock.sh` — see below.

**Manual closeout — `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh`, run at every increment closeout** (see CLAUDE.md §Increment Completion Protocol). This is the full gate and the *only* place these run:

- The **full** engine SPM suite + the app `xcodebuild test` suite (incl. the ~74 Metal/GPU tests that `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()` and so *fail, not skip,* without a GPU).
- The **licensed-fixture** suites (BeatThis / tempo / live-drift / identity) — fixtures are gitignored, so CI can't run them.
- The **perf-timing** assertions (single-sample wall-clock budgets that flake under shared-runner contention).
- **`check_blocking_calls_under_lock.sh`** (BUG139.2) — *temporarily* closeout-only. It was red on `main` while BUG-139 was open (`SystemAudioCapture.teardownTapResources` held `stateLock` across `AudioDeviceStop`), so putting it in CI then would have blocked every PR on someone else's in-flight branch. **BUG139.1 has now merged and the gate is green on `main`, so the promotion this note asked for is unblocked** — adding it to the CI lints above is the remaining step. Left to BUG139.2's owner rather than done here: the gate and its CI wiring are that increment's design, and this edit only corrects a status sentence that BUG139.1's merge made false. Closeout-stronger-than-CI is the safe direction of the asymmetry, but it is still an asymmetry and it is still meant to close.

CI green ≠ closeout green. CI is the fast push/PR signal; the closeout block is still mandatory before merge. The loud-on-missing-fixture rule (`BeatThisFixturePresenceGate`) stays loud **locally** — CI simply doesn't run those suites; it is never weakened into a silent skip.

### Worktree setup: fetch local audio fixtures

`UzumeEngine/Tests/Fixtures/tempo/` is gitignored — the directory contains 30-second iTunes preview clips for the DSP.1 / BUG-008 / BeatThis regression tests, and those clips are licensed (do not commit). Fresh checkouts and new `git worktree add` sessions do not inherit them.

If `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine` reports 4 `BeatThis*` / `LiveDriftValidation` / `BeatGridAccuracyDiagnostic` failures with messages like *"love_rehab.m4a missing at .../Tests/Fixtures/tempo/love_rehab.m4a"*, the fixtures are missing. Either:

```bash
# The one to run (BUG-080, 2026-08-03): symlinks every gitignored tree a
# worktree needs — tempo fixtures AND the ~479 ML weight .bin files — from
# the primary checkout, driven by a <path>|<required>|<regex> manifest.
# Idempotent. Hard-errors if a required source tree is empty.
Scripts/link_fixtures.sh

# Check the SOURCE is complete without linking anything:
Scripts/link_fixtures.sh --verify
```

**Use `link_fixtures.sh`, not `bootstrap_fixtures.sh`.** *(Corrected at RECON.4, 2026-08-03 — this section documented only `bootstrap_fixtures.sh`, which is the narrower and older of the two.)* The distinction matters and cost a full misdiagnosis at BUG-080:

| | `link_fixtures.sh` | `bootstrap_fixtures.sh` |
|---|---|---|
| Covers | tempo fixtures **+ ML weights** (+ the two docs image trees) | tempo fixtures only |
| Missing source | **hard error** on a required tree | falls through to network fetch |
| Mechanism | symlink from the primary | `cp -R`, then fetch |

**The required set is three files, and `fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh` covers all three** — `love_rehab.m4a`, `so_what.m4a`, `there_there.m4a`, the canonical list in `Scripts/fixtures.manifest`. *(Corrected at RECON.13, 2026-08-04. This paragraph previously claimed the fetch script retrieved "3 of at least 8" and named pyramid_song, yyz, clair_de_lune, money and if_i_were_with_her_now as missing. That was wrong — it conflated three separate fixture systems. See the note below, because the distinction is the useful part.)*

**Three fixture systems, easily confused:**

| System | Where it lives | Gated by | Runs by default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **tempo fixtures** (3 licensed clips) | `UzumeEngine/Tests/Fixtures/tempo/`, gitignored | `FixtureManifestPresenceGate` | **yes** |
| **BeatBench** (17 tracks) | *outside the repo* at `BEATBENCH_FIXTURES_DIR` | `BeatBenchFixturePresenceGate`, sha256-matched | no — env-gated |
| **diagnostic harnesses** (e.g. `pyramid_song.m4a`) | `Fixtures/tempo/`, gitignored | none | no — env-gated suites |

Only the first is needed for a green `swift test`. `pyramid_song.m4a` has exactly one consumer, `RicercarFluidVideoHarness` ("env-gated" in its own suite name); names like yyz / take_five / billie_jean are BeatBench tracks and were never expected in this directory.

**The real ceiling — partial trees pass as complete.** Both `bootstrap_fixtures.sh` (`ls -A` non-empty → `exit 0`) and `link_fixtures.sh --verify` historically treated a **non-empty directory** as a complete one, so a tempo tree holding 1 of 3 clips satisfied both while still failing tests. RECON.13 replaced that with a file-level check against `Scripts/fixtures.manifest`, which is also the single source both the scripts and the Swift gate now read. Remaining known limitation: `link_fixtures.sh` symlinks rather than copies, so a worktree breaks if the primary moves or is deleted.

`Scripts/fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh` (public iTunes Search CDN) can still be run directly when you have no primary checkout to link from — it retrieves the complete required set.

The `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` suite is intentionally designed to fail loudly when the fixture tree is empty — silent skips have masked the DSP.2 S8 four-bug regression surface in the past (see CLAUDE.md *§What NOT To Do* on silent fixture skips).

## Local-file stem cache management (LF.3 / LF.4 / LF.5, D-130 / D-131 / D-132)

Local-file playback (LF.4 + LF.5) persists the offline pre-analysis result
(`BeatGrid` + per-stem waveforms + `StemFeatures` + `TrackProfile` + ID3 /
Vorbis / MP4-atom `LocalFileMetadata` + optional artwork bytes) to disk
under

```
~/Library/Application Support/Uzume/StemCache/sha256/<aa>/<full-hash>/
```

where `<aa>` is the first two hex chars of the file's SHA-256 (filesystem
sharding) and `<full-hash>` is the full hex digest. Each entry holds five
mandatory files (`metadata.json` ~5 KB + four `<stem>.f32` raw Float32 PCM
files at ~1.76 MB each) plus an optional sibling `artwork.bin` (raw image
bytes — PNG / JPEG, depending on the source container). Per-track footprint:
~6.7 MB plus artwork (typical 30–500 KB when present).

**Schema version:** v2 since LF.5 (D-132). v1 entries on disk throw
`schemaMismatch` on load → caller re-prepares with v2. One-time ~2 s cost
per cached track on next play after the bump.

**User-facing controls (LF.4).** `Uzume → Clear Local-File Cache (<size>)`
shows the current cache footprint in the menu label and empties the cache
on click (with a confirmation alert reporting the bytes freed). Automatic
LRU eviction runs after every cache write — the default 500 MB cap
(~70 cached tracks) keeps the footprint bounded without manual cleanup.

**Operator commands.**

```sh
# Inspect contents
find "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Uzume/StemCache" -type f

# Size
du -sh "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Uzume/StemCache"

# Wipe all cached entries (or use Uzume → Clear Local-File Cache)
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Uzume/StemCache"

# Wipe one entry by file hash
shasum -a 256 path/to/file.m4a   # → c1685f07d559...
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Uzume/StemCache/sha256/c1/c1685f07d559..."

# Override the default 500 MB eviction cap (1 GB example)
defaults write io.uzume.mac uzume.cache.localFile.maxBytes -int 1073741824

# Read the current cap (LF.4)
defaults read io.uzume.mac uzume.cache.localFile.maxBytes
```

**When to clear the cache.**

- After upgrading `StemSeparator` model weights — the cached stems were
  produced by the old separator and are now stale relative to live runs.
  Cache schema versioning does NOT auto-detect model drift; this is an
  operator responsibility.
- After upgrading the Beat This! model checkpoint — same story for cached
  BeatGrids.
- After bumping `PersistentStemCache.currentSchemaVersion`. (Mismatched
  entries are auto-treated as misses and overwritten — no manual wipe
  required, but it's tidy to clear them in one shot.)
- When disk-space is tight and the user wants to reclaim per-track
  footprint.

**Cache-corruption recovery.** A `STEM_CACHE_MISS: source=persistentDisk,
…, reason=load-failed(…)` line in `session.log` indicates an entry was
present but unreadable. The path then runs fresh analysis and overwrites
the broken entry — no manual intervention required.

**Cache hit/miss telemetry.** Session-log lines `STEM_CACHE_HIT` /
`STEM_CACHE_MISS` / `STEM_CACHE_WROTE` log each cache event (track name,
12-char hash prefix, BPM/beats, write byte count, elapsed ms). LF.5 adds
`artworkBytes=N` to `STEM_CACHE_WROTE` (0 when the source ships no
embedded art). See `docs/diagnostics/LF3_COLD_WARM_2026-05-27.md`,
`docs/diagnostics/LF4_REGRESSION_2026-05-27.md`, and
`docs/diagnostics/LF5_REGRESSION_2026-05-28.md` for the cold-vs-warm
latency reference per increment.

## Recents menu management (LF.5, D-132)

`File → Open Recent ▸` persists the last 10 file / folder / M3U opens to
the `uzume.lf.recents` UserDefaults key as a JSON-encoded list.

```sh
# Inspect (the value is JSON inside a `<data>` blob — base64-decode if needed)
defaults read io.uzume.mac uzume.lf.recents

# Reset (use the menu's "Clear Recents" item, or wipe via defaults)
defaults delete io.uzume.mac uzume.lf.recents
```

Stale entries (file no longer at the recorded path) render disabled with a
`(missing)` suffix in the submenu; clicking removes them rather than
attempting to open. The on-disk format is validated on every load; an
oversized list (corrupted future-version write) is truncated to the
`maxRecents = 10` cap and re-persisted on the next mutation. No operator
intervention required for normal use.

## Folder + M3U ingest behavior (LF.5, D-132)

`File → Open Local Folder…`, M3U drops, and multi-file drags route through
`SessionManager.startLocalFiles(at:origin:)`. Folder expansion is
recursive depth-first alphabetical (`localizedStandardCompare` on full
path). M3U parsing tolerates UTF-8 BOM, CRLF + LF line endings, `#EXTM3U`
/ `#EXTINF` comment lines, `file://` URLs, absolute paths, and relative
paths resolved against the M3U file's parent directory. Lines that don't
resolve to a readable audio file are silently skipped (collected in
`ParseResult.skippedLines` for callers that want to surface them; the
default UI path ignores them).

**Queue cap.** Folder + multi-drop queues > 200 audio files truncate to
the first 200 (alphabetical) with a localized NSAlert. This cap balances
against the 500 MB cache cap (~70 cached tracks) — larger queues would
thrash eviction mid-playback. Users with libraries > 200 audio files
should pick smaller subset folders or trim the M3U.

**File-association.** `Info.plist` registers Uzume as an Alternate
handler (NOT Default) for `m4a / mp3 / flac / m3u / m3u8`. Once the
LaunchServices database has re-indexed the bundle (typically takes
effect after the first launch of a new build), the user can right-click
a registered file in Finder → "Open With…" → Uzume. To force a
LaunchServices re-registration without restarting:

```sh
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/Current/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/Current/Support/lsregister \
  -kill -r -domain user
# then verify Uzume is registered:
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/Current/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/Current/Support/lsregister -dump | grep -i uzume
```

## Claude Code Session Checklist

Every session that modifies Swift code must end with all four passing:

1. `swiftlint lint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml`
2. `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build 2>&1`
3. `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine 2>&1`
4. All existing tests pass before new code is merged (regression gate)

## First-Launch Checklist

1. Launch app.
2. Check screen capture permission status.
3. Start capture.
4. Confirm non-zero signal (check debug overlay).
5. Confirm render loop active.
6. Confirm debug overlay shows source and signal state.

## Debug Overlay Fields

- Active capture provider
- Permission state
- Signal present / absent (`AudioSignalState`)
- Signal health (`health:` line — peak band + `⚠ DEAD-TAP` / `⚠ RATE!<hz>` flags, ASH.1 / see §"Signal health monitor")
- Sample rate
- Current track
- Preparation state
- Current scene
- Frame time / dropped-frame warning

## Common Failure Modes

### App captures silence

Likely causes: screen capture permission not granted, wrong capture mode, process tap misconfigured, DRM-triggered silencing, scrub-induced source teardown.

Checks:
- Call `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` / `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` before starting capture.
- `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` succeeds without permission but delivers zeros.
- Confirm the system-wide tap installed (system audio is the only capture mode).
- Check `SilenceDetector` state transitions (`.active` → `.suspect` at 1.5s → `.silent` at 3s).
- DRM silence: Apple Music lossless/FairPlay and Spotify DRM can zero out the tap buffer. This is expected — Uzume degrades to ambient visual mode and monitors for recovery.
- Scrub-induced silence: scrubbing in Spotify / Apple Music tears down the source process's audio session and the existing tap stays alive but delivers permanent silence. `AudioInputRouter` automatically reinstalls the tap on backoff `[3s, 10s, 30s]` after `.silent` is confirmed. Look for `Tap reinstall scheduled` / `Tap reinstall #N succeeded` lines in `session.log` to confirm recovery fired.

### Audio levels too low (raw tap peaks below −15 dBFS)

Likely causes: source app normalization, system-wide attenuation in the routing chain, audio MIDI Setup misconfiguration.

Checks:
- **Spotify**: Settings → Playback → toggle **"Normalize volume"** OFF. Default normalization (-14 LUFS) drops mastered peaks to ~0.15-0.20.
- **Apple Music**: Settings → Playback → toggle **"Sound Check"** OFF.
- **Streaming quality**: pin to **Very High** / **Lossless**, disable any "auto-adjust quality" toggle. Lower bitrates compress dynamic range and flatten transients.
- **Audio MIDI Setup**: if a Multi-Output Device is the system output, all member devices should be at the same sample rate (48 kHz preferred — Uzume's stem pipeline assumes 44.1/48 kHz internally; 96 kHz forces resampling). Set the *physical* device (e.g., built-in speakers) as Primary and enable Drift Correction on virtual subdevices, not the other way around.
- **External USB/Thunderbolt interfaces (e.g., Apogee Duet 3 — current canonical playback chain)**: same 48 kHz rule. Open Audio MIDI Setup → select the interface → Format → **48,000.0 Hz, 2 ch 32-bit Float** on both Input and Output tabs. Make the interface the system default output (System Settings → Sound → Output). **Switching the default output device invalidates Uzume's Screen Recording permission** — the process tap continues to install successfully and deliver silent zeros, with no UI signal that the chain is broken. Re-grant via System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → toggle Uzume off then on, relaunch, and confirm `Signal: Active` in the debug overlay within 1.5 s of audio starting. Same trap fires on any default-output change (built-in → interface, interface A → interface B, headphone unplug if the system rebinds defaults).
- **Verification**: `raw_tap.wav` (30s Stage-4 capture in each session dir) peak should land at −3 to −9 dBFS for properly mastered tracks with normalization off. Peaks below −15 dBFS point to source-app normalization or routing attenuation. **Do not interpret post-stem-separation WAV spectra as the raw chain** — the stem separator isolates per-instrument content, so a "drums.wav with narrow spectrum" on a drum-sparse track tells you nothing about the chain. Only `raw_tap.wav` reflects what macOS actually delivers to Uzume.

### Diagnosing signal-chain degradation (proper methodology)

Do not guess at chain culprits from post-processing symptoms. The audio pipeline has distinct stages:

```
Spotify → coreaudiod → CATap → IO proc → AudioBuffer → FFT → StemSeparator → stem WAVs
[Stage 1]  [Stage 2]   [Stage 3] [Stage 4]  [Stage 5]   [Stage 6]  [Stage 7]     [Stage 8]
```

`SessionRecorder` captures **Stage 4** as `raw_tap.wav` (first 30 seconds, IEEE Float32 48 kHz stereo) and **Stage 8** as `stems/<N>_<title>/{drums,bass,vocals,other}.wav`.

To localize degradation:

1. **Spectrum-check `raw_tap.wav`** — this is ground truth for what macOS hands us. If it looks clean here, the issue is in Uzume or the scene, not the source chain.
2. **If `raw_tap.wav` is degraded**, play a 20 Hz–20 kHz sine sweep through the same chain (YouTube: "20Hz to 20kHz sine sweep stereo"). A clean chain produces a flat spectrum across the sweep duration; any dip localizes the attenuated frequency range.
3. **If the sweep is flat but specific content still looks wrong**, the issue is Spotify/source app — bypass it with a locally-owned FLAC/MP3 through QuickTime and re-capture.
4. **Post-separation stem WAVs are unreliable for chain diagnostics** — they reflect the stem separator's per-instrument isolation, not the mix. A track with minimal drums will produce a narrow-spectrum `drums.wav` regardless of chain quality.

This procedure was established after session 2026-04-17T21-05-47Z, where earlier guesses at Voice Isolation / Multi-Output Device / BT codec degradation were all wrong — `raw_tap.wav` analysis confirmed the chain was clean and Oxytocin's bass-heavy spectrum was the song, not chain loss. Always test Stage 4 before concluding anything about upstream stages.

### Signal health monitor

`SignalHealthMonitor` (ASH.1 / D-183) turns the triage above into running code: it classifies the input chain continuously from the raw pre-AGC tap and surfaces the result in the debug overlay `health:` line and in `session.log` as `SIGNAL_HEALTH: peak=<dBFS> band=<b> deadTap=<bool> rate=<hz>` (logged on state CHANGE only, not per window). Three detectors, each mapping to a failure mode + remediation above:

| Detector | Overlay / log | Failure mode | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `peakBand` | `band=healthy` (≥ −12 dBFS) / `low` (−15…−12) / `critical` (< −15) | §"Audio levels too low" — source-app normalization, chain attenuation, low system volume | Turn off Spotify **Normalize volume** / Apple Music **Sound Check**; raise system volume; check the output chain isn't a Multi-Output/BlackHole device. |
| `deadTap` | `⚠ DEAD-TAP` | §"App captures silence" — the permission-invalidation trap: the tap installs and delivers silent zeros with no error (invalidated Screen-Recording grant after a default-output change, wedged `coreaudiod`) | Re-grant Screen Recording (toggle off/on, relaunch); `killall coreaudiod` if a wedged daemon is feeding all taps zero. See D-165 for the reinstall machinery. |
| `sampleRateMismatch` | `⚠ RATE!<hz>` | §"Audio levels too low" (Audio MIDI Setup) — default output device outside the 44.1/48 kHz family, forcing resample | Audio MIDI Setup → set the interface Format to 48,000.0 Hz on both Input and Output. |

`deadTap` fires only after `.silent` persists ~45 s (past the [3,10,30]s reinstall backoff), distinguishing a genuinely dead tap from an ordinary between-tracks gap. It is gated to process-tap modes; local-file playback silence is real musical silence, not a broken tap. The monitor **observes only** — it never steers tap recovery (that is `AudioInputRouter`'s job, D-165). Note: a very long deliberate pause also trips `deadTap` (indistinguishable from a dead tap from the zero stream alone); ASH.2 decides the user-facing response.

### Jank / dropped frames

Likely causes: scene too expensive, ML workload colliding with rendering, post-process or particle budget exceeded.

Checks:
- Inspect frame timing in debug overlay.
- Test with simpler scene to isolate.
- Ray march scenes with SSGI are the most expensive (~8ms + 1ms overhead at 1080p).
- MPSGraph stem separation runs on GPU — check for contention with heavy render passes. (Increment 6.3 mitigates this; check `ML: dispatch ...` log lines in `session.log` for force-dispatches, which indicate the 2s ceiling was hit under sustained jank.)

### Wrong or missing metadata

Likely causes: streaming app metadata unavailable, API timeout or rate limit, track identity mismatch.

Checks:
- Self-computed MIR is the source of truth — metadata is supplemental.
- MetadataPreFetcher has 3s per-fetcher timeouts.
- PreviewResolver rate limiter: 20 req/60s sliding window.
- Continue with audio-only mode if all external sources fail.

### Spotify connector failure modes

**Missing Client ID** (`authFailure` state; DEBUG builds say "No Spotify Client ID in this build…", Release shows the generic "Couldn't connect to Spotify"):
- `SpotifyClientID` in Info.plist is empty.
- Cause: `UzumeApp/Uzume.local.xcconfig` was never created — or was lost, since it is gitignored and therefore absent after `git clean -fdx`, a fresh clone, or in a new worktree.
- Fix: follow §Spotify connector setup above (creating the file is all that is needed). Build again after editing the xcconfig.

**Redirect URI mismatch** (browser shows Spotify error page after login):
- Cause: the redirect URI registered in Spotify's developer dashboard does not exactly match `uzume://spotify-callback`.
- Fix: re-open the app on developer.spotify.com, edit the redirect URI, and save.

**Authorization denied by user** (`authFailure` state):
- User clicked "Cancel" or "Deny" on the Spotify authorization page.
- Fix: tap "Log in with Spotify" again and approve.

**Login timeout** (`authFailure` state, "Login timed out"):
- The user did not complete the browser flow within 5 minutes.
- Fix: tap "Log in with Spotify" again.

**Refresh token revoked** (`requiresLogin` state reappears on launch):
- Cause: user revoked Uzume's access in Spotify account settings, or the token expired after a very long period.
- Fix: tap "Log in with Spotify" again to re-authenticate.

**Private playlist** (`privatePlaylist` state, "That playlist is private"):
- HTTP 403 while the user IS authenticated. Two distinct causes:

  **Cause A — Playlist is genuinely private:** Most common. The playlist owner has set it to private.
  - Fix: make the playlist public in Spotify, or use a different playlist.

  **Cause B — Spotify Developer App not configured for Web API (403 on any playlist, even public ones):**
  Spotify's Developer Dashboard requires apps to explicitly opt in to Web API access. If "Web API"
  was not checked when creating the app, the access token is issued without playlist permissions,
  and all `/v1/playlists/{id}/tracks` requests return `{"error":{"status":403,"message":"Forbidden"}}`.
  This happens even for public playlists with a valid OAuth token.
  - Diagnosis: Check `Console.app` → filter for "Spotify 403 body" in the `io.uzume.mac` process.
    If body is exactly `{"error":{"status":403,"message":"Forbidden"}}`, it's Cause B.
  - Fix:
    1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), open your app.
    2. Click **Edit** → under "Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?", tick **Web API**.
    3. Add or re-confirm redirect URI: `uzume://spotify-callback`.
    4. Click **Save**.
    5. Delete the stored refresh token: open Keychain Access → search "io.uzume.spotify" → delete it.
    6. Relaunch Uzume and log in again. The new token will carry playlist permissions.

**Empty playlist / 0 tracks prepared (reactive fallback despite successful login):**
Root causes, in order of likelihood:
1. `"item"` key — the `/items` endpoint uses `"item"` (not `"track"`) as the PlaylistTrackObject key since 2024. A `"track"` key lookup returns nil for all items. Check console for `hasItem=true hasTrack=false`.
2. `fields` query parameter — field-filtered responses silently return `{}` for items where the filter path doesn't match. Check console for `first-item keys: []`. Fix: remove `fields` from the request.
3. `market` parameter missing — region-restricted tracks return null track objects. Add `market=from_token`.
4. Dual-connector re-fetch — the non-OAuth default connector must not re-fetch after OAuth succeeds. CLEAN.2.1 removed the client-credentials provider, so the no-arg `PlaylistConnector()` default now throws `.spotifyAuthFailure` instead of silently re-fetching (and 401-ing); the production path injects the OAuth connector and routes via `startSession(preFetchedTracks:source:)`. Check `IdleView` source routing if a Spotify session still re-fetches.

**Rate limit exhausted** (after [2s, 5s, 15s] backoff fails):
- Spotify API quota exceeded.
- Fix: wait 60 seconds and retry. Access tokens are cached for their full lifetime (~1 hour).

### Preparation takes too long

Likely causes: preview download bottleneck (network), large playlist.

Checks:
- Preview downloads are the bottleneck (~10MB total for 20 tracks).
- Stem separation is ~142ms per track on Apple Silicon.
- Total preparation budget: ~20–30s for a full playlist.
- Progressive readiness is a planned improvement (see ENGINEERING_PLAN.md).

### Stem separation produces garbage

Likely causes: STFT parameter mismatch, weight file corruption.

Checks:
- STFT params: n_fft=4096, hop=1024, sample_rate=44100, 431 frames (~10s).
- Weights: 172 `.bin` files in `ML/Weights/`, tracked via Git LFS. Verify `manifest.json`.
- Performance gate: warm predict must be <400ms.

### Display hot-plug causes jank or quality downshift after reconnect

When an external display is connected or disconnected, the `MTKView` drawable reparents and emits a burst of anomalous frame timings that can temporarily suppress stem separation via `MLDispatchScheduler`.

Expected behaviour:
- `DisplayChangeCoordinator` calls `FrameBudgetManager.resetRecentFrameBuffer()` on active-screen removal or window move.
- The rolling timing window is cleared. `MLDispatchScheduler` loses its deferral signal and reverts to `dispatchNow` until the window refills with real frames (~0.5 s at 60 fps).
- Quality level (`currentLevel`) is **not** reset — the governor retains its downshift position.

If quality unexpectedly drops to `.reducedMesh` after reconnect: check `session.log` for `quality: rolling window cleared (display event)` — if absent, `DisplayChangeCoordinator` was not wired in `PlaybackView.setup()`. See [Architecture §Long-Session Resilience](ARCHITECTURE.md#long-session-resilience-increment-72-d-061).

### Preparation stalls after brief network outage (tracks remain .failed)

During session preparation, a brief network outage may leave tracks in `.failed` status with no automatic retry.

Expected behaviour:
- `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator` monitors `ReachabilityMonitor.isOnlinePublisher`.
- On `false → true`, it waits 3 s (1 s from monitor + 2 s additional debounce) then calls `SessionManager.resumeFailedNetworkTracks()`.
- Only network-class failures (`.noPreviewURL`, `.downloadFailed`) are retried. Stem-separation failures are not.
- Cap: 3 automatic attempts per preparation session.

If tracks are still stuck after reconnect: check `session.log` for `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator: network restored — resuming failed tracks`. If absent, verify `NetworkRecoveryCoordinator` is wired in `PreparationProgressView.onAppear`. After 3 automatic attempts, use the "Retry" button in `PreparationFailureView` for a manual hard-restart.

## Diagnostic Session Captures

> **Renamed at RN.5 (2026-08-31, D-230).** Captures now land in
> `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/`, BeatBench fixtures in `~/uzume_beatbench_fixtures/`,
> soak reports in `~/Documents/uzume_soak/`, plus `~/uzume_features.csv`,
> `~/uzume_diag.log` and `/tmp/uzume_visual/`. The existing 5.7 GB of captures and
> 946 MB of fixtures were **moved**, not re-created — nothing was orphaned. If you are
> reading a document under `docs/diagnostics/` or `docs/prompts/`, its
> `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/...` paths are frozen records of a past run: the
> capture still exists, under the new directory name.
>
> Two `phosphene_`-named things are deliberately unchanged and are **not** oversights:
> `phosphene_grid_bpm`, a key inside recorded BeatBench ground-truth fixtures (renaming it
> would edit recorded evidence), and `~/phosphene-ml-env`, the Python virtualenv — an
> external artifact this repo does not own. Rename the venv yourself if you want it to
> match, and update the two comments that reference it.


Every Uzume launch creates `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<ISO-timestamp>/` and writes diagnostic data continuously while the app runs. Use these to triage user-reported issues (visualizer behaviour, audio dropouts, stem-quality concerns).

**Files:**

- `video.mp4` — H.264 capture of the rendered output, 30 fps. Open in QuickTime / VLC. Writer locks to drawable size after 30 stable frames; mid-session size changes are logged and skipped from video, not blitted into wrong-sized buffers.
- `features.csv` — per-frame `FeatureVector` (60 rows/sec): bass/mid/treble, 6-band, beat onsets, spectral, valence/arousal, accumulatedAudioTime.
- `stems.csv` — per-frame `StemFeatures`: drums/bass/vocals/other × {energy, beat, band0, band1}.
- `stems/<NNNN>_<title>/{drums,bass,vocals,other}.wav` — listenable mono PCM dump per stem-separation cycle. Good for verifying separation quality on a real track.
- `session.log` — startup banner, signal state transitions, track changes, scene changes, video writer state.

**Triage isolation rules** (when a session looks wrong):

| Symptom | Most likely root cause |
|---|---|
| `features.csv` all zeros during music | App audio path broken (tap silent, MIR not running) |
| `features.csv` non-zero but `video.mp4` black | Capture blit broken in recorder |
| `video.mp4` matches what user saw | Recorder works end-to-end; problem is upstream (visualizer or audio) |
| `stems/*.wav` silent when drums clearly audible | Stem separator broken |
| `stems/*.wav` contain real audio | Separation works |
| `session.log` missing startup banner | Recorder failed to initialize (disk, permissions, path writable?) |
| `session.log` has `Tap reinstall scheduled` entries | Audio path saw silence; check whether reinstall succeeded |
| `video frame skipped: drawable WxH != writer WxH` log lines | Drawable size changed mid-session (window resize) |

**Frozen-app exception.** If Uzume is unresponsive or beachballing, do not force-quit it
yet. From the repository root, run `Scripts/capture_hang.sh` and wait for the script to report
its capture directory. The bundle records a process sample, process state, session-log tail,
and the recent drawable lifecycle needed to diagnose renderer stalls. After the capture
finishes, force-quit Uzume if necessary. If the process is terminated first, this evidence
cannot be recovered.

**Quitting cleanly matters.** `AVAssetWriter.finishWriting` is called from an `NSApplication.willTerminateNotification` observer in `VisualizerEngine.init`. Force-quitting the app (Activity Monitor, kill -9) skips this and leaves `video.mp4` without its `moov` atom — unplayable. Use ⌘Q.

## Reclaiming Git-LFS storage

**Do not improvise this.** [`docs/RUNBOOK_LFS_RECLAIM.md`](RUNBOOK_LFS_RECLAIM.md) is the procedure: what it does and does not fix (rewriting history does NOT reduce the bill — a GitHub Support request does), the branch-protection failure mode that half-applies the push and leaves the repo split-brain, the pre-flight ref capture that makes recovery possible, and the 2026-07-31 incident record. Highest blast radius of any operation in the repo: every clone, worktree, PR and branch.

## Operational Rules

- Never block the render loop on network or ML work.
- Never allocate in the real-time audio callback.
- Never assume metadata is correct — cross-reference with MIR.
- Never let beat pulses dominate motion.
- Never ship a scene without a performance profile.
- Never use `print()` — use `os.Logger` via `Shared/Logging.swift`.
- Never use `.storageModeManaged` buffers.
- Never use `CATapDescription(stereoMixdownOfProcesses: [])` with an empty array (silence). Use `CATapDescription(stereoGlobalTapButExcludeProcesses: [])`.
- App sandbox is disabled (`com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false`).
- Any scene that includes `mv_warp` in its `passes` array must implement `mvWarpPerFrame()` and `mvWarpPerVertex()` in its `.metal` file. Missing implementations cause a linker error at scene-library compile time. See `VolumetricLithograph.metal` for a reference implementation. (Note: Murmuration — formerly `Starburst.metal` — does **not** use mv_warp; it is `["feedback", "particles"]` per D-029.)
- New ray-march scenes should include `mv_warp` in their passes unless there is a deliberate reason not to. Without per-vertex feedback accumulation, ray-march scenes show only instantaneous audio state regardless of how sophisticated the shader drivers are (MV-2, D-027).

## ThreadSanitizer concurrency validation (CLEAN.1.6 / GAP-7)

```bash
Scripts/tsan_stress.sh
```

Runs the concurrency + session-lifecycle stress and regression tests under
`swift test --sanitize=thread` to prove the BUG-031/032 fixes are race-free
(not merely moved). The script sets `UZUME_STRESS=1`, the opt-in gate for
`ConcurrencyStressTests` — the heavy overlapping-`separate()` + rapid
session-start/end/cancel-churn harness, which skips in the normal suite so the
per-increment closeout stays light. Pass condition: exit 0 **and** zero
`ThreadSanitizer: data race` lines; the script greps for races and emits a
`TSAN CLEAN` / `TSAN FAILURES PRESENT` verdict. TSan rebuilds with instrumentation
on first use (~5-15× slower), so this is an on-demand gate, not part of the
closeout. Verified 2026-06-13: TSan builds and runs clean against the real
Metal/MPSGraph `StemSeparator` — no suppressions file needed.

## Running a Soak Test (Increment 7.1)

### Quick smoke run (60 seconds, in test suite)

```bash
SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter SoakTestHarnessTests
```

Reports are written to `$TMPDIR/uzume_soak_smoke_<timestamp>/`.

### 5-minute memory check (in test suite)

```bash
SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter "SoakTestHarnessTests/fiveMinuteMemoryCheck"
```

### 30-second Arachne COMPOSITE kernel cost benchmark (BUG-011 regression gate)

```bash
SOAK_TESTS=1 swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter shortRunArachneComposite
```

Renders Arachne's COMPOSITE fragment to a 1920×1080 offscreen target for 30 simulated seconds at 60 Hz with the spider forced active and a placeholder WORLD texture bound; reports p50 / p95 / p99 / kernel-overrun count from `MTLCommandBuffer.gpuStartTime/gpuEndTime`. Loose gate: kernel p95 < 16 ms on M2 Pro. Arachne is fragment-only so kernel ≈ full-pipeline; spider-forced is the worst case. Failures indicate a shader-side regression (step count, coverage gate, or dispatch gate creep) before the full-pipeline real-music capture catches it.

### Full 2-hour production run (CLI, with App Nap prevention)

```bash
Scripts/run_soak_test.sh
```

The script builds `SoakRunner` in release mode, then runs:
```bash
caffeinate -i .build/release/SoakRunner --duration 7200
```

Reports are written to `~/Documents/uzume_soak/<ISO-timestamp>/report.json` and `report.md`.

### Custom run (shorter duration for iteration)

```bash
swift build --package-path UzumeEngine --configuration release --product SoakRunner
caffeinate -i UzumeEngine/.build/release/SoakRunner \
  --duration 300 \
  --sample-interval 30 \
  --audio-file /path/to/loop.wav
```

### Interpreting the report

| `finalAssessment` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pass` | No alerts fired |
| `passWithSoftAlerts` | Soft thresholds crossed (memory, drops, downshifts, ML force) — informational |
| `hardFailure` | `MemoryReporter` returned nil > 5 times — indicates Mach kernel API failure |

**Soft alert thresholds (defaults):**
- Memory growth from baseline: 50 MB
- Dropped frames: 60/hour
- Quality governor downshifts: > 3
- ML force dispatches: > 10/hour

Pass these as `SoakTestHarness.Configuration` overrides for different workloads.

## Recording the quality reel

The quality reel is a 3-minute screen capture of Uzume playing the canonical
playlist (`docs/quality_reel_playlist.json`). Output: `docs/quality_reel.mp4`,
1080p60, H.264, ~50–150 MB. Committed via Git LFS.

**Procedure:**

1. Confirm all three playlist tracks are present in your Apple Music library
   and queueable via the Uzume Apple Music connector.
2. Build Uzume Release: `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp -destination 'platform=macOS' -configuration Release`.
3. Set your display to 1920×1080 (external display or Sidecar at 1080p).
4. Open Uzume and connect the playlist. Wait for `.ready` state.
5. Open macOS Screen Recording (Cmd+Shift+5 → "Record Selected Portion"), target
   the Uzume window. Set audio source to OFF — the reel captures visuals only.
6. Start recording, then immediately start playback in your music app.
7. Record continuously through all three segments (∼3 min). Do not stop and
   re-start between segments — transitions are part of the artefact.
8. Save as `docs/quality_reel.mp4`. Git LFS commits automatically on `git add`.

**Using Spotify as the source (v1 reel procedure):**

Spotify is a viable reel source — the canonical v1 reel (`docs/quality_reel.mp4`)
was captured this way. Two settings are mandatory and one architectural difference
requires adjustment.

*Spotify settings (before recording):*
- **Settings → Playback → Normalize volume: OFF.** Default normalization (-14 LUFS)
  drops mastered peaks to ~0.15–0.20 RMS, compressing AGC headroom and degrading
  the mood classifier. Failed Approach #30.
- **Settings → Playback → Audio quality → Streaming quality: Lossless (or Very
  High).** Lower bitrates introduce encoding artifacts that corrupt spectral flux
  thresholds and produce spurious onsets.

*Reactive-mode caveat:*
Uzume has no Spotify OAuth integration. Without OAuth, `SessionManager` cannot
call `startSession(source: .spotify(...))` — the `.ready` state is never reached
via the normal preparation pipeline. Instead, launch Uzume and invoke
`startAdHocSession()` (the "Start listening now" CTA in IdleView), which advances
directly to `.playing` (reactive mode). The AI Orchestrator has no pre-planned
session; `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` drives scene selection live. This is a
known degradation relative to a full Apple Music session — the Orchestrator has not
pre-analyzed stems and cannot schedule transitions at structural boundaries. For
V.6 fidelity evaluation, which is per-scene visual quality rather than plan
quality, this is acceptable. See D-066.

*Post-recording sanity checks:*
1. **raw_tap.wav peak level**: Open the session's `raw_tap.wav` (in
   `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>/`) in QuickLook or Audacity.
   Peak level should be −3 to −9 dBFS. If peak is below −12 dBFS, Spotify
   normalization was still active — re-record.
2. **DRM-silence scan**: `grep -i "drm\|silence\|silent\|recovering" ~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>/session.log`.
   Expect zero `DRM silence` lines for Spotify Lossless. If DRM silence appears,
   the track triggered FairPlay and the captured segment is visually inert — discard
   that segment.
3. **Tap-reinstall scan**: `grep -i "tap reinstall" ~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>/session.log`.
   Any reinstall entries indicate a scrub-induced silence; if they appear inside a
   recording segment, that segment's visuals will show a freeze gap — discard.
4. **Love Rehab onset-count spot-check** *(informational only — see the warning below)*:
   the analyzer reports `loveRehabMedianOnsetsPer5s` in `chain_health.json`. Reference:
   11 sub_bass onsets per 5 s at ~125 BPM (ARCHITECTURE §Validated Onset Counts).
   > ⚠️ **This count does NOT detect normalization (ASH.2 / D-184).** It was empirically
   > established that the `beatBass` onset count is AGC-invariant — attenuation, dynamic
   > compression, and hard limiting all leave it at ~11/5 s (level-independent rhythm,
   > D-026). Normalization is caught by the **peak check (step 1)**, not onsets. Treat a
   > low onset count as a signal-*loss* hint (silence/dead tap), not a normalization hint.

**Mechanized (ASH.2 / D-184):** steps 1–3 above are now run automatically — `ChainAnalyzer`
writes `chain_health.json` + a `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=<clean|degraded|broken> reasons=[…]`
line into every session dir at session end. **A reel recording must carry `verdict=clean`.**
Regrade any dir (including a just-finished one, or a pre-ASH historical dir) with
`Scripts/analyze_session_chain.sh <session-dir>` (exit 0 iff clean). See §"Post-session
chain analyzer" below.

**Clone instructions (if LFS not yet pulled):**

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull   # downloads quality reel + ML weights + reference images
```

**Re-recording policy:** when V.6+ uplifts land, re-record if visuals changed
materially. Increment `"version"` in `quality_reel_playlist.json` and save the
prior reel as `quality_reel_v<N>.mp4` so prior artefacts remain referenceable.

**Do NOT build an in-engine capture pipeline for this.** QuickTime is sufficient;
adding video output to the engine is a cross-cutting change with frame-pacing
and file-handling scope that doesn't belong in a curation increment. (D-064(d))

## Post-session chain analyzer (ASH.2 / D-184)

`ChainAnalyzer` grades the audio chain that produced a session and leaves a
machine-written verdict in the dir, so no M7 review, reel recording, or fidelity
closeout runs on degraded audio without a red flag in the artifacts.

**Automatic.** At the end of every session (`SessionRecorder.finish()`) the analyzer
writes two things into `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>/`:
- `chain_health.json` — `{verdict, reasons[], peakDBFS, outputSampleRateHz, loveRehabMedianOnsetsPer5s, maxFullScaleRun, notes[]}`
  - ⚠ **`peakDBFS: 0` is a real measurement, not a default** (BUG-129). It means the capture touches full scale, which is ordinary for a
    limited master — read `maxFullScaleRun` beside it: **1** is a master grazing the rail once, a long run is flat-topping and raises
    `clipped(run=…)`. Since BUG087.5 retired the tap, local-file captures are the decoded file at unity gain, so 0 dBFS is common there
    where tap captures used to read ≈ −6.
- a `session.log` line: `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=<clean|degraded|broken> reasons=[…]`

**On demand / retroactive** (grades any dir, including pre-ASH ones — missing
artifacts are noted, never fatal):

```bash
Scripts/analyze_session_chain.sh ~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>
# exit 0 iff verdict=clean; prints the verdict + peak + onset median
```

**Verdict meaning:**
- `broken` — capture unusable: a confirmed dead tap (`SIGNAL_HEALTH deadTap=true`) or a
  critical raw_tap peak (< −15 dBFS / silence). Discard; fix the chain (see §"App
  captures silence" / `killall coreaudiod`).
- `degraded` — usable but compromised: low peak (−15…−12 dBFS — the normalization/
  attenuation signal), `DRM silence` lines, `band=low/critical`, or tap reinstalls.
  **Do not certify or record a reel off a `degraded` capture without re-capturing.**
- `clean` — no degradation evidence. Required for reel + M7-bound sessions.

**`loveRehabMedianOnsetsPer5s` is informational only** — AGC-invariant (D-184), not a
verdict input. Do not read a low onset count as "normalization"; that is the peak
check's job.

## Reviewing rubric reports (Increment V.6)

### Print the full rubric breakdown for all scenes

```bash
swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter "FidelityRubricReportTests/rubricReport_allPresetsLoad" 2>&1 | grep -E "\[.\]|pass|FAIL|manual"
```

Runs Suite 1 of `FidelityRubricTests` and prints each scene's per-item breakdown. No content assertions — this is a diagnostic readout only.

### Locking in a newly passing scene (Suite 2 gate)

After a fidelity uplift that flips a scene's `meetsAutomatedGate` from `false → true`:

1. Run the report above and confirm the scene shows `[✓]`.
2. Open `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Renderer/FidelityRubricTests.swift`.
3. In `expectedAutomatedGate` (Suite 2), change the scene's entry from `false` to `true`.
4. Run `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter FidelityRubricGateTests` to confirm no regressions.
5. Commit the updated dictionary referencing the scene and D-067.

### Certifying a scene (setting `certified: true`)

**Corrected at PUB.7 (ultra-review):** the previous steps here contradicted a
dozen actual certifications — `meetsAutomatedGate == true` is NOT a
prerequisite (most certified scenes are `false`: CPU-side coupling is
invisible to the MSL-source heuristic — the Skein/Lumen/Filigree precedent,
each documented in `expectedAutomatedGate`), and the load-bearing gate is
**Matt's live M7 review** (SHADER_CRAFT §12.1), not the report. The real
procedure, as practiced from Skein through Cytokinesis:

1. **Matt's live M7 sign-off on real music** — the non-waivable gate.
2. Set `"certified": true` in the scene's sidecar.
3. Join the fail-loud certified test tables (cert ≠ just the flag flip — the
   flip is what makes the gates enforce, NACRE.4 lesson):
   - `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets` + an `expectedAutomatedGate`
     entry at the scene's MEASURED value (with a comment explaining a
     `false` — e.g. CPU-side coupling);
   - `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests.multiPassMeasured` + a real render
     function in `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` for multi-pass/follower-state
     scenes (the static-render guard fails loud if skipped) — measured
     **0.00 flashes/s** required.
4. Non-empty `audio_routes` in the sidecar, all green (`RouteCoverageTests`
   — QG.1 requires it for certification).
5. Full battery: `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter
   "FidelityRubric|Photosensitivity|MultiPassFlash|RouteCoverage"` +
   `OrchestratorCertifiedFilterTests` (the scene now enters planning).

### Debugging a failing rubric item

| Item | Diagnosis |
|------|-----------|
| M1 (detail cascade) | Add `// macro`, `// meso`, `// micro` comments OR 3+ distinct scale literals in noise calls |
| M2 (octave count) | Use `fbm8(` or `warped_fbm(` — single-octave noise fails |
| M3 (materials) | Add 3+ `mat_*` cookbook calls: `mat_polished_chrome(`, `mat_frosted_glass(`, `mat_wet_stone(`, etc. |
| M4 (deviation) | Replace `f.bass > 0.x` with `f.bass_dev`/`f.bass_rel`; at least one deviation field required |
| M5 (silence) | Check D-019 warmup: `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` gate before stem reads |
| M6 (perf) | Lower `complexity_cost.tier2` in JSON sidecar or optimize shader |
| P1 (hero specular) | Set `"rubric_hints": {"hero_specular": true}` in JSON after visual confirmation |
| P3 (dust motes) | Set `"rubric_hints": {"dust_motes": true}` or add `ls_radial_step_uv(` call |

## Engineering notes (moved from CLAUDE.md §Code Style at RB.2-2, 2026-06-11)

Build/test mechanics that fire rarely but cost real debugging time when hit:

- **`URLProtocol` stub tests require `@Suite(.serialized)`** (U.10). Swift Testing runs suites in parallel by default. A suite using a global `nonisolated(unsafe) static var handler` on a `URLProtocol` subclass must be annotated `@Suite(.serialized)` — otherwise one test's handler bleeds into another test's in-flight URL session on a background thread. Discovered when 5 of 9 `SpotifyTokenProviderTests` returned HTTP 400 instead of 200 during parallel execution.
- **New app-layer source files must be registered in `project.pbxproj` across all four sections** (U.11): `PBXBuildFile`, `PBXFileReference`, `PBXGroup` (parent group), and `PBXSourcesBuildPhase`. Files on disk but not in the project file cause `cannot find type` build errors. The project uses alphabetical UUID prefixes (N10xxx / N20xxx were next-available at U.11). `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp build` fails immediately if any section is missing.
- **`@MainActor` debounce test timing margins under parallel execution** (U.11). Under 305-test parallel app execution, `@MainActor` scheduling contention grows: a 300 ms debounce needs a 700 ms wait (2.3× headroom); async actor-hop completions (connect, login) need 250–400 ms.
