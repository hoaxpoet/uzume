// Mirrors the dispatch table in `VisualizerEngine.resolveParticleGeometry`
// (app layer). Adding a new particle preset means adding the name here,
// the factory call in `VisualizerEngine.init`, and the case in
// `resolveParticleGeometry`.
//
// Lives in a separate file from `ParticleGeometry.swift` so the protocol
// surface stays byte-identical across DM.1 (D-097 carry-forward — the
// DM.1 verification checklist requires `git diff` against
// `ParticleGeometry.swift` to return zero).
//
// `ParticleDispatchRegistryTests` walks the production preset catalog and
// asserts every preset whose `passes` contains `.particles` is listed
// here, closing the silent-fall-through hole where a JSON-side typo in
// the preset name would render an audio-driven backdrop with no
// particles.
