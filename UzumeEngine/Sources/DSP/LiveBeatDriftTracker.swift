// LiveBeatDriftTracker — Drift cross-correlation against an offline BeatGrid.
//
// Phase DSP.2 S7. Replaces BeatPredictor's IIR rising-edge tracker for tracks
// that have a cached `BeatGrid` from Beat This! offline analysis. The cached
// grid is the ground truth for beat timing; this tracker only follows playback
// clock drift and dropped-frame jitter so the live `beatPhase01` stays aligned
// with the beats the user actually hears.
//
// Algorithm:
//   1. On each sub_bass onset (BeatDetector.Result.onsets[0] == true), find
//      the nearest cached beat to (playbackTime + currentDrift) within ±50 ms.
//      If matched, EMA-update drift toward (nearestBeat − playbackTime).
//   2. Each frame: phase = ((playbackTime + drift − beats[idx]) / period),
//      clamped [0, 1], where idx is the beat at-or-before (playbackTime + drift).
//   3. If no onset within the search window for > 2× medianBeatPeriod, decay
//      drift toward 0 with the same time-constant (no runaway).
//   4. lockState progresses unlocked → locking → locked once 4 onsets have
//      contributed within ±30 ms of cached beats; back to .locking on 3
//      consecutive misses; .unlocked when no grid is installed.
//
// Reactive-mode fallback: when `setGrid(.empty)` is called (no offline analysis
// succeeded), the tracker emits zero phase / unlocked state and the MIRPipeline
// integration falls back to BeatPredictor.
//
// Thread safety: NSLock-guarded.
