    // MARK: - Full-file stem series (LFSTEM.1)

    /// Analysis hop the live path uses, and therefore the series grid.
    /// `VisualizerEngine+Audio.runPerFrameStemAnalysis` slides a 1024-sample window; a series
    /// on any coarser grid would not be a drop-in for what presets already consume.
    nonisolated static let seriesAnalysisHop = 1024

    /// Build a dense `StemFeatureSeries` covering the whole of `samples`.
    ///
    /// **The point of this function.** Live separation is late by construction: it can only
    /// analyse audio that has already played, so stem features reach presets ~2.5 s behind the
    /// music. Given the whole file up front — which local-file preparation already decodes —
    /// there is no reason to be late. Each frame is computed offline and handed to the renderer
    /// at the playback second it describes.
    ///
    /// **Window placement, which is the part that matters.** The separator works on a fixed
    /// window (~10 s). Rather than analysing each window whole and discarding most of it, this
    /// sweeps *kept spans* of `hopSeconds` in playback order and places each span at the END of
    /// its separation window wherever the audio allows:
    ///
    /// ```
    ///   window k:  [------------- ~10 s -------------]
    ///   kept:                                [ hop  ]
    /// ```
    ///
    /// That is deliberately the same relative position the live path reads from — live analyses
    /// the newest slice of the most recent separation — so the series carries the same character
    /// as the values presets were tuned against, only arriving on time instead of late. Near the
    /// start of the file the window cannot be pushed earlier, so the span sits wherever it falls
    /// inside the first window; those frames see less preceding context, exactly as they do live
    /// at track start.
    ///
    /// **AGC continuity.** One analyzer instance sweeps every span in playback order, so its
    /// band-energy AGC carries across span boundaries the way it does across live separations.
    /// Analysing spans independently would restart the AGC 120 times and put a discontinuity at
    /// every hop.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - samples: Fully decoded mono PCM for the whole track.
    ///   - sampleRate: Sample rate of `samples`.
    ///   - separator: Production separator. Its window length is read from the first result
    ///     rather than assumed, so a test double with a different window still works.
    ///   - analyzer: A FRESH analyzer — this function relies on owning its AGC state.
    ///   - hopSeconds: Playback seconds each separation contributes. 2.0 matches the live
    ///     separation period, so the offline sweep does the same amount of model work per second
    ///     of audio that live playback would.
    /// - Returns: The series, or `.empty` when there is too little audio to analyse.
