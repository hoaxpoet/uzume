// need to write to multiple `@Published private(set)` properties, which
// can't be done from an extension in a separate file. The file_length
// disable above is the tracked acknowledgement — splitting requires
// internal setter helpers which add more lines than they save.
//
// Increment 6.1: Progressive Session Readiness.
// startSession() no longer blocks until preparation completes. Instead it:
//   1. Connects to the playlist (awaited — can still fail fast).
//   2. Sets currentPlan from the full track list immediately.
//   3. Subscribes to preparer.$trackStatuses to drive progressiveReadinessLevel.
//   4. Launches preparation as a stored Task and returns (state stays .preparing).
// The UI can call startNow() once progressiveReadinessLevel >= .readyForFirstTracks,
// which transitions .preparing → .ready while preparation continues in the background.
// When preparation completes naturally, .preparing → .ready fires automatically;
// if startNow() was already called the Task just updates currentPlan and readiness.
