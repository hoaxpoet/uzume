// UserFacingError — Typed enum covering every user-visible error surface in Uzume.
//
// Lives in the Shared module (engine-layer) so Session, Audio, and App can all
// reference the same typed cases. Copy lives in the App bundle's Localizable.strings;
// `LocalizedCopy` (App layer) bridges case → localized string.
//
// Organised by the four §9 tables in UX_SPEC.md:
//   §9.1 Permission (3 cases)
//   §9.2 Connection (7 cases)
//   §9.3 Preparation (7 cases)
//   §9.4 Playback (12 cases)
//
// Total: 29 cases matching the 29 rows in UX_SPEC §9.1–§9.4.
//
// CaseIterable is provided via manual `allCases` because Swift cannot synthesise
// it for enums with associated values. Use `representativeCases` in tests.
