# Capability Registry — App Layer (engine-adapter slice)

**Audit increment:** CA.5
**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Auditor:** Claude (session-driven, read-only)
**Scope:** `UzumeApp/` engine-adapter slice — 49 Swift files, 7,975 LoC. The Views (47 files) + ViewModels (12 files) presentation slice is deferred to CA.6 per the Pass 0 sub-scope decision below.
**Methodology:** Phase CA scoping document — CA.5 kickoff in commit `54357118`.
**Reads relied on:** `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md` (CA.1), `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ML.md` (CA.2), `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/SESSION.md` (CA.3), `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md` (CA.4), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-046, D-049, D-050, D-052, D-053, D-054, D-057, D-058, D-061, D-069, D-070, D-074, D-079, D-080, D-088, D-091, D-095, D-097, D-LM-buffer-slot-8, D-LM-palette-library), `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (BUG-001, BUG-005, BUG-006, BUG-011, BUG-012, BUG-013, BUG-015, BUG-016), `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (Phase U + Phase QR + Phase CA), `docs/UX_SPEC.md`.

## Summary

49 file-level entities audited (~8.0k LoC) across the engine-adapter slice of `UzumeApp/`. The slice is the consumer-side surface for every Orchestrator / Session / DSP / ML / Renderer capability the prior four audits documented. **Headline finding: the just-landed BUG-015 wire is structurally correct.** The App-layer landing of `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)`, the lock-guarded `liveTrackPlanIndex` / `lastClassifiedMood` / `orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack` fields, the once-per-track diagnostic, the off-plan skip path, and the OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests source-presence regression test all match the BUG-015 Resolved-field design notes byte-for-byte. **Zero `broken-but-claimed` findings; zero new BUG entries filed.**

The audit's substantive content sits in the doc-drift cluster (large; same shape as CA.1 / CA.2 / CA.3 / CA.4 found) and two small field-level findings (a `production-orphan` field cluster in `MultiDisplayToastBridge`; a stale file-header docstring in `LiveAdaptationToastBridge`). One additional non-defect surface observation is captured for BUG-016's open diagnosis without proposing a fix.

| Verdict | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `production-active` | 48 files | Default verdict. Every App-layer engine-adapter file in scope has at least one production consumer; documented behaviour matches code. |
| `production-orphan` | 1 cluster (field-level) | `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask: Task<Void, Never>?` + `MultiDisplayToastBridge.pendingEvents: [String] = []` (`MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:22–23`). Both fields are declared in service of a documented coalescing intent (`// Coalescing: rapid adds/removes within 0.5s produce one toast.` at line 21), but **no consumer of either field exists**. Cited grep below returns only the declaration sites. The handlers `handleAdded` / `handleRemoved` enqueue toasts unconditionally — no coalescing logic was ever wired. Same shape as CA.4-FU-1's `transitionPolicy` field. Registered as CA.5-FU-1. |
| `unverified-claim` | 1 | `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:6` docstring claims "Two observation sources: user actions via PlaybackActionRouter, engine events (currently wired only for UserDefaults flag check and coalescing logic)." Code only routes user-action acks via `emitAck()`. The BUG-015 wire's engine-event downstream consumer logs to `os.Logger` + `session.log` and does not call `emitAck()`. Honest reading: the docstring hedges with "currently wired only for …" so it does not lie, but a future reader could expect engine-event toasts to fire from this bridge. The audit recommends either wiring engine adaptation events through `emitAck()` (post-BUG-015) or rewriting the docstring. Registered as CA.5-FU-2. |
| `broken-but-claimed` | 0 | BUG-015 (the only `broken-but-claimed` finding in scope of the App-layer audit) is already filed AND Resolved 2026-05-21. CA.5 verifies the resolution; see §Verification-of-BUG-015-wire-shape. |
| `documented-but-missing` | 0 | — |
| `built-but-undocumented` | 2 large | (a) `ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map UzumeApp/` block lists 12 of 49 engine-adapter files — **37 absent**. Full list under §Cross-references below. Same systemic pattern as CA.1 (DSP/ 6-of-20), CA.2 (ML/ 9-of-16), CA.3 (Session/ 13-of-22), CA.4 (Orchestrator/ 9-of-14). (b) `ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map Tests/UzumeApp/` block is **absent entirely** — 60+ test files exist including the load-bearing regression tests `OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests`, `SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests`, `PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests`. |
| `stub` | 0 | — |
| `dead` | 0 | (At the file level. The two dead fields in `MultiDisplayToastBridge` are counted under `production-orphan`.) |
| `boundary-noted` | 7 | App ↔ Orchestrator (BUG-015 wire + `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` + `PresetScoringContextProvider` + scoring-context builders); App ↔ Session (`SessionManager` + `StemCache` + `MetadataPreFetcher` ownership); App ↔ DSP (`MIRPipeline` construction + per-frame consumer); App ↔ ML (`MoodClassifier` + `StemSeparator` + `MLDispatchScheduler` consumption); App ↔ Renderer (`RenderPipeline` + `FrameBudgetManager` + slot-6/7/8 buffer wiring); App ↔ Audio (`AudioInputRouter` + audio-thread → analysis-queue handoff); App ↔ Presets (per-preset state classes + `setMeshPresetTick` closures + slot-binding contract). All boundary verdicts complete. |
| `boundary-deferred` | 0 (new) | — |

**Top findings, ranked.**

1. **BUG-015 wire shape verified clean.** All seven design notes from the Resolved field land in code byte-for-byte: (a) `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)` declared at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:287`; (b) called from `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:184` at the end of `processAnalysisFrame`; (c) cadence gate `analysisFrameCount % Self.orchestratorWireFrameDivisor == 0` with `orchestratorWireFrameDivisor: Int = 30`; (d) off-plan skip path `if snapshot.hasPlan, snapshot.trackIndex == nil { return }`; (e) `liveTrackPlanIndex` written in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:131` under `orchestratorLock`; (f) `lastClassifiedMood` written in `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:432` (`publishMoodResult`) under `orchestratorLock`; (g) `orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack` reset on track change at `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:137`. The once-per-track diagnostic at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:323–331` dual-writes to `sessionRecorder?.log(msg)` AND `logger.info("\(msg)")`. The regression test `UzumeAppTests/OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests.swift` asserts source-presence via two `@Test` methods that strip comments first (so doc-comment mentions don't satisfy the assertion).

2. **BUG-012-i1 instrumentation intact** in both App-layer instrumented files. `VisualizerEngine.swift:709` (`init`) and `VisualizerEngine.swift:718` (`deinit`) both call `BUG012Probe.recordVisualizerEngineInit()` / `recordVisualizerEngineDeinit()`. `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` carries the lifecycle probes at all expected sites (timer entry, no-scheduler path, defer path, `performStemSeparation` enter/exit, `separator.separate` CALL/RETURN, dispatch-ID allocation). 48 `BUG012Probe` references total across the 8 instrumented files; no edits made in this audit per CA.5 Hard Rules.

3. **`MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `pendingEvents` field-level production-orphan.** Cited grep:
   ```
   $ grep -rn "pendingEvents\|coalesceTask" UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift UzumeAppTests
   UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:22:    private var coalesceTask: Task<Void, Never>?
   UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:23:    private var pendingEvents: [String] = []
   ```
   Only the declaration sites. The line-21 comment "Coalescing: rapid adds/removes within 0.5s produce one toast" describes a behaviour the code does not implement. Registered as CA.5-FU-1.

4. **`LiveAdaptationToastBridge` engine-event path absent at runtime.** The file's top docstring at line 6 claims "engine events (currently wired only for UserDefaults flag check and coalescing logic)." The BUG-015 wire's downstream consumer (`applyLiveUpdate(...)` at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:167`) emits adaptation events via `logger.info(...)` only (line 195) and never calls `emitAck()`. Cited grep:
   ```
   $ grep -rn "emitAck\|toastBridge\." UzumeApp --include="*.swift"
   UzumeApp/Services/DefaultPlaybackActionRouter.swift:250: toastBridge?.emitAck("Boosted \(familyName)")
   UzumeApp/Services/DefaultPlaybackActionRouter.swift:275: toastBridge?.emitAck("Not quite hitting the mark? Try ⌘R to re-plan.")
   …
   UzumeApp/Services/LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:62:    func emitAck(_ message: String) {
   ```
   All 11 `emitAck` call sites live in `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter.swift` (user-action acks). The docstring hedges with "currently wired only for…" so it does not lie, but the gap is undocumented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DECISIONS.md`. Registered as CA.5-FU-2.

5. **ARCHITECTURE.md doc drift cluster.**
   - **§Module Map UzumeApp/ block** lists `ContentView`, `UzumeApp`, `VisualizerEngine`, `VisualizerEngine+Audio`, `VisualizerEngine+Stems`, `VisualizerEngine+Presets`, plus 3 `Permissions/` entries (complete) plus 6 `Services/` entries — but 24 `Services/` files and 7 `VisualizerEngine+*` extensions are absent. The 2 `Models/` files (`UzumeToast.swift`, `SettingsTypes.swift`) have no module-map entries. `MusicKitFetcher.swift` is not listed. Full list of 37 missing entries in §Cross-references.
   - **§Module Map Tests/UzumeApp/ block** is **absent**. The Tests/ block has entries for Audio / DSP / ML / Renderer / Session / Orchestrator but not App. 60+ App-test files exist.
   - **§UI Layer line 224** says `SessionStateViewModel` "Lives in `UzumeApp/ViewModels/`." Correct, but the surrounding paragraph claims it's the bridge for `SessionManager.state` only — it also surfaces `reduceMotion` from `accessibilityState` via the `init(sessionManager:accessibilityState:)` signature used at `UzumeApp.swift:50–53`. Minor description refinement; not blocking.

6. **`MusicKitFetcher.swift` filename drift.** File contains `ITunesSearchFetcher` class with explicit top-comment `// ITunesSearchFetcher — Free, unauthenticated iTunes Search API for genre + duration. No developer account, no tokens, no MusicKit authorization needed.` The filename is misleading. Recommend renaming the file to `ITunesSearchFetcher.swift` to match its contents. Registered as CA.5-FU-3.

7. **BUG-016 App-layer surface inventory (open diagnosis aid; no fix attempted).** Lumen Mosaic's apply path lives **inside** `case .rayMarch:` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:166–178` — gated on `if desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"`, not a separate `.lumenMosaic:` case (the kickoff used loose phrasing). The path:
   - Constructs `LumenPatternEngine(device: context.device)` (init can return `nil`; failure logs to `os.Logger` but produces no Lumen-specific session.log line).
   - Binds `engine.patternBuffer` via `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(...)` — slot 8 per CLAUDE.md GPU Contract / D-LM-buffer-slot-8 ✓.
   - Wires per-frame tick via `pipeline.setMeshPresetTick { [weak engine] features, stems in engine?.tick(features: features, stems: stems) }`.
   - The per-track palette refresh runs in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:518–567` via `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack(...)` which reads `stemCache?.trackProfile(for: identity)?.mood` (falls back to `(0,0)` mood-space centre when uncached) and calls `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.selectPalette(...)`.
   - Reset on preset switch sets `lumenPatternEngine = nil` at line 61 and `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(nil)` at line 69.

   **No regression test exercises the Lumen Mosaic App-layer apply path end-to-end** — `LumenPatternEngineTests` covers the GPU struct stride (`568` bytes) only. The audit observes this gap without proposing a fix; the gap is a candidate diagnostic step for BUG-016 once the failure mode is characterised. **Cross-link from BUG-016 to this section.**

8. **`D-091 / Failed Approach #55` enforcement verified clean.** Cited grep:
   ```
   $ grep -rnE "@StateObject.*SettingsStore" UzumeApp UzumeAppTests
   UzumeApp/UzumeApp.swift:25:    @StateObject private var settingsStore = SettingsStore()
   UzumeApp/Views/Playback/PlaybackView.swift:52: /// `@StateObject SettingsStore()` here creates a parallel state world —
   UzumeAppTests/SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests.swift:42:        @StateObject var shadowStore = SettingsStore(...)
   UzumeAppTests/SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests.swift:148: #expect(!src.contains("@StateObject private var settingsStore = SettingsStore()"),
   ```
   One legitimate construction in `UzumeApp.swift:25` (the app-entry single-instance store, per D-091). All other hits are: comments warning against the bad pattern (`PlaybackView.swift:52`), or the regression-test's shadow probe + source-presence assertion. No production code re-introduces the dead pattern.

9. **`@Suite(.serialized)` annotation present** on the only URLProtocol-stub-using App test (`UzumeAppTests/SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests.swift:98 — @Suite("SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider", .serialized)`). U.10 rule satisfied.

10. **SwiftLint baseline:** zero warnings in `UzumeApp/` (18 warnings remain in `UzumeEngine/`: `Presets/FerrofluidOcean/FerrofluidMesh.swift`, `Presets/SpectralCartographText.swift`, `Shared/SessionRecorder.swift` — all out of CA.5 scope). App-layer is SwiftLint-clean. The unrelated pending SwiftLint cleanup chip is engine-side, not App.

**Three follow-up items registered in [§Follow-up Backlog](#follow-up-backlog).** Plus one CA.6 hand-off (Views + ViewModels — the deferred half of the App layer).

---

## Sub-scope decision

Pass 0 confirmed the kickoff's recommended split. The chosen scope:

- **CA.5 (this increment):** Engine-adapter slice — 49 files / 7,975 LoC. Top-level files (14: `VisualizerEngine` + 11 extensions + `ContentView` + `UzumeApp` + `MusicKitFetcher`), `Services/` (30), `Permissions/` (3), `Models/` (2).
- **CA.6 (deferred):** Views + ViewModels presentation slice — 59 files / 6,889 LoC. `Views/` (47 across `Connecting/`, `Dashboard/`, `Ended/`, `Idle/`, `Onboarding/`, `Playback/`, `Preparation/`, `Ready/`, `Settings/` + root-level views including `MetalView.swift`) + `ViewModels/` (12).

The split is justified by architectural layering: `Services/` + `VisualizerEngine` are the engine-coupling surface where the four prior audits' findings actually fire (BUG-015 wire, `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` per D-050, `PresetScoringContextProvider` per Orchestrator scoring, `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator` per D-061, etc.). `Views/` + `ViewModels/` is the SwiftUI presentation surface where U.x increments shipped UX flows and is its own audit class. **No silent scope-creep occurred.**

The kickoff prompt said "MetalView.swift — though MetalView lives under Views/" and listed it under both top-level and Views/ scopes. CA.5 follows the actual filesystem location: `MetalView.swift` is under `UzumeApp/Views/MetalView.swift` and is deferred to CA.6 along with the rest of `Views/`.

## Findings by verdict

### broken-but-claimed (BUG entries filed)

**None filed in this increment.** BUG-015 (the only App-layer-class `broken-but-claimed` finding in scope) was already filed by CA.4 and Resolved on 2026-05-21 before CA.5 began. The wire shape is verified clean in §Verification-of-BUG-015-wire-shape below.

### production-orphan

**1. `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `pendingEvents` — declared, never read or written.**

```
$ grep -rn "pendingEvents\|coalesceTask" UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift UzumeAppTests UzumeApp --include="*.swift"
UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:22:    private var coalesceTask: Task<Void, Never>?
UzumeApp/Services/MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:23:    private var pendingEvents: [String] = []
```

Two field declarations, zero consumers across the App layer and App tests. The file-internal logic (`handleAdded` at line 39, `handleRemoved` at line 56) enqueues toasts unconditionally; neither field is touched. The line-21 comment `// Coalescing: rapid adds/removes within 0.5s produce one toast.` documents an intent the code does not implement.

Same shape as CA.4-FU-1's `DefaultLiveAdapter.transitionPolicy`: a field captured in the constructor (here at declaration default value) that no subsequent code reads. Either the coalescing should be implemented (matching the stated intent) or both fields + the comment should be removed. The choice is a product call — display hot-plug events arrive at human-scale cadence on Macs (seconds, not milliseconds), so the practical risk of unbatched toasts during a single hot-plug is low; the intent is documented but possibly not load-bearing. Registered as CA.5-FU-1.

### unverified-claim

**1. `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:1–14` docstring claims engine-event observation source that has no production-wired consumer.**

```swift
// LiveAdaptationToastBridge — Emits ack toasts for engine adaptation events + user actions.
…
// Two observation sources:
//   1. User actions via PlaybackActionRouter (post-U.6b)
//   2. Engine events (currently wired only for UserDefaults flag check and coalescing logic)
```

The implementation has one public emission method, `emitAck(_:)` at line 62. All 11 production call sites of `emitAck` live in `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` (cited grep above). The BUG-015 wire's engine-side adaptation events (`applyLiveUpdate(...)` at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:167`) log via `logger.info(...)` at line 195 only — no `emitAck` invocation.

The "currently wired only for…" hedge avoids the claim being a hard lie, but the docstring leaves a future reader believing engine adaptation events should reach this bridge. Either decision is fine:

- **Option A** (engine adaptation toasts ARE intended): wire the `applyLiveUpdate` adaptation-event loop at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:189–197` to call `toastBridge?.emitAck(event.message)` for `.boundaryRescheduled` / `.moodDivergenceDetected` / `.presetOverrideTriggered` events. The UserDefaults flag at `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:31` already gates emission.
- **Option B** (engine adaptation toasts are NOT intended; user-action acks are the only purpose): rewrite the docstring to drop the "engine events" line and rename or expand `emitAck` documentation to make clear only user-action acks reach this surface.

The audit recommends surfacing this to Matt as a product call (it is a UX question, not a correctness defect). Registered as CA.5-FU-2.

### documented-but-missing

**None this increment.** Every App-layer capability that load-bearing docs claim to exist was verified against code.

### dead

**None.** Every public, internal, or fileprivate symbol in scope has at least one live consumer, with the exception of the two `MultiDisplayToastBridge` fields counted under `production-orphan` above.

### stub

**None.** No `#if`-gated public types or empty bodies in scope.

### built-but-undocumented

**1. `ARCHITECTURE.md §Module Map UzumeApp/` block lists 12 of 49 engine-adapter files; 37 missing.**

**Listed (12):** `ContentView`, `UzumeApp`, `VisualizerEngine`, `VisualizerEngine+Audio`, `VisualizerEngine+Stems`, `VisualizerEngine+Presets`, `Permissions/ScreenCapturePermissionProvider`, `Permissions/PermissionMonitor`, `Permissions/PhotosensitivityAcknowledgementStore`, `Services/DelayProviding`, `Services/SpotifyURLKind`, `Services/SpotifyURLParser`, `Services/DisplayChangeCoordinator`, `Services/CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator`, `Services/NetworkRecoveryCoordinator`. (Counted 15; recount: yes, 6 Services entries — the audit's earlier "6 Services" count was correct. Including ContentView + UzumeApp + VisualizerEngine + 3 extensions + 3 Permissions + 6 Services = **15 listed**, not 12. Recount accepted; total still 49 − 15 = **34 missing**.)

**Missing (34):**

`UzumeAppTests/` exists with 60+ test files. The Tests/ section of the Module Map has entries for `Audio/`, `DSP/`, `ML/`, `Renderer/`, `Session/`, and (post-CA.4) `Orchestrator/` — but not `UzumeApp/`. Notable App-layer test files:

- **`OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests.swift`** — BUG-015 source-presence regression gate.
- **`SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests.swift`** — D-091 / Failed Approach #55 regression gate (three assertions: `@EnvironmentObject` consumer sees changes; `@StateObject SettingsStore()` shadow does NOT see changes; `PlaybackView.swift` source must not contain the bad declaration).
- **`PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests.swift`** — D-091 / QR.4 plan-index propagation (`title-case mismatch must not change index`).
- **`DefaultPlaybackActionRouterTests.swift`** — D-050 / U.6b router contract.
- **`NetworkRecoveryCoordinatorTests.swift`** — D-061(d,e) recovery cap + debounce.
- **`SpotifyConnectionViewModelTests.swift`** + **`SpotifyKeychainStoreTests.swift`** + **`SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests.swift`** — U.11 cluster (the OAuth test suite carries `@Suite("SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider", .serialized)` per U.10 URLProtocol-stub rule).
- **`PresetScoringContextProviderTests.swift`** — App ↔ Orchestrator scoring-context bridge.
- **`LiveAdaptationToastBridgeTests.swift`** — U.6 Part C ack toast bridge.
- **`AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests.swift`** — U.3 connector state machine.
- **`PlaybackErrorBridgeTests.swift`** + **`PlaybackErrorConditionTrackerTests.swift`** — UX_SPEC §9.4 silence-error routing.
- **`SessionRecorderRetentionPolicyTests.swift`** — Pruning policy invariants.
- **`SettingsMigratorTests.swift`** — Legacy UserDefaults migration round-trip.
- Plus the per-VM tests `PlaybackChromeViewModelTests`, `ToastManagerTests`, `ReadyViewTimeoutIntegrationTests`, etc. (CA.6 will inventory the VM-side tests).

### boundary-noted

The audit produced no `boundary-deferred` items. The following App-layer boundary surfaces are noted (verdict complete; no future re-audit required):

- **App ↔ Orchestrator.** `DefaultSessionPlanner` + `DefaultLiveAdapter` + `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` instantiated at `VisualizerEngine.swift:458 / 461 / 464`. `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter` concrete lives in `UzumeApp/Services/`. `PresetScoringContextProvider` builds `PresetScoringContext` for the Orchestrator scorer. The **BUG-015 wire** (`runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)` calling `applyLiveUpdate(...)` at ~3 Hz) is the load-bearing post-2026-05-21 surface; verified clean in §Verification-of-BUG-015-wire-shape. CA.4 closed the Orchestrator side; CA.5 closes the App side. Boundary verdict: **complete**.

- **App ↔ Session.** `SessionManager` constructed at `VisualizerEngine.swift:644` via `Self.makeSessionManager(...)` factory (`+InitHelpers.swift:99`). `StemCache` wired eagerly at `VisualizerEngine.swift:658` (`self.stemCache = self.sessionManager.cache` — BUG-006.2 fix). `MetadataPreFetcher` constructed at `VisualizerEngine.swift:641` and shared between `SessionPreparer` and the runtime track-change callback (Round 26 metadata-meter override). `stateCancellable` subscribes to `sessionManager.$state` and triggers `buildPlan()` on `.ready` (`VisualizerEngine.swift:687–692`); `readinessCancellable` subscribes to `$progressiveReadinessLevel` and triggers `extendPlan()` (`VisualizerEngine.swift:696–705`). Per CA.3 the Session side is clean. Boundary verdict: **complete**.

- **App ↔ DSP / MIR.** `MIRPipeline()` constructed at `VisualizerEngine.swift:622`; `audioOutputLatencyMs: 50.0` set at `:627` per BUG-007.6 default. Per-frame consumer is `processAnalysisFrame` at `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:135` which calls `mir.process(magnitudes:fps:time:deltaTime:)` and threads the result through `pipeline.setFeatures(fv)`, `pipeline.updateFeedbackBeatValue(from: fv)`, `updateSpectralCartographBeatGrid`, the per-frame stem analyzer, `runLiveBeatAnalysisIfNeeded`, the mood classifier, and finally `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)`. CA.1's per-frame `StructuralAnalyzer` chain now has a runtime consumer (via the BUG-015 wire reading `mir.latestStructuralPrediction` at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:336`) — **CA.1-FU-1's CPU-saving gate option (a) is no longer the cleanest path**; the per-frame chain is genuinely consumed now. CA.1-FU-1 closure question is now product (keep gate-to-prep-time + sentinel, or feed runtime predictions through) — surfaced to Matt below. Boundary verdict: **complete**.

- **App ↔ ML.** `MoodClassifier` loaded via `Self.loadMoodClassifier()` at `VisualizerEngine.swift:586` and consumed at `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:289` (`mood.classify(features:)`). `StemSeparator` loaded via `Self.loadStemSeparator(device:)` at `:614`. `StemAnalyzer(sampleRate: StemSeparator.modelSampleRate)` constructed at `:585`. `MLDispatchScheduler` constructed at `VisualizerEngine.swift:668` with tier-dependent budget (`14ms` Tier 1, `16ms` Tier 2 — `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:113`); consumed in `runStemSeparation()` decision at `+Stems.swift:121`. Boundary verdict: **complete** (CA.2's read of the ML side already validated this consumption shape).

- **App ↔ Renderer.** `RenderPipeline` constructed at `VisualizerEngine.swift:600`. `FrameBudgetManager` and `MLDispatchScheduler` constructed at `:667 / :668` reading `QualityCeiling` from `UserDefaults` at `:662–665`. `RayMarchPipeline` constructed per-preset in `applyPreset` (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:115`) and stored in `currentRayMarchPipeline` so `debugGBufferMode` toggles can push directly (`VisualizerEngine.swift:107–109`). Per-preset state classes (`ArachneState` + `GossamerState` + `AuroraVeilState` + `LumenPatternEngine` + `FerrofluidParticles` + `FerrofluidMesh` + `DynamicTextOverlay`) bind to slots 6 / 7 / 8 via `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` / `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer2` / `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3` per CLAUDE.md GPU Contract. Per-frame tick closures wired via `setMeshPresetTick`. Boundary verdict: **complete**.

- **App ↔ Audio.** `AudioInputRouter` constructed at `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:26` (stored as `Any?` to avoid availability propagation per `VisualizerEngine.swift:196`). Three callbacks wired: `onAudioSamples` at `+Audio.swift:30` runs on the audio thread (writes `audioBuffer`, captures `tapSampleRate` via `updateTapSampleRate(_:)` per D-079 / QR.1, feeds `stemSampleBuffer`, runs FFT, dispatches to `analysisQueue.async`); `onSignalStateChanged` at `+Audio.swift:31` hops to MainActor for `@Published` updates; `onTrackChange` at `+Audio.swift:39` resolves `liveTrackPlanIndex` and `orchestratorLock`-guards the BUG-015 wire inputs before hopping to MainActor for SwiftUI consumers. **Cross-core visibility** for `tapSampleRate` is enforced via `tapSampleRateLock: NSLock` (`VisualizerEngine.swift:243`); the `_tapSampleRate` mutation goes through `updateTapSampleRate(_:)` which `withLock`s the write. CLAUDE.md D-079 / QR.1 rule satisfied. Boundary verdict: **complete**.

- **App ↔ Presets.** Per-preset state classes (`ArachneState`, `GossamerState`, `LumenPatternEngine`, `FerrofluidParticles`, `FerrofluidMesh`, `DynamicTextOverlay`) live in `UzumeEngine/Sources/Presets/` but are instantiated and owned in `VisualizerEngine.swift` (lines 119–163). The siblings-not-subclasses pattern per D-097 is enforced via `resolveParticleGeometry(forPresetName:)` at `VisualizerEngine.swift:754` (currently maps `"Murmuration"` → `murmurationGeometry`; unknown names return nil). The `wirePresetCompletionSubscription()` at `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:500` and `presetCompletionCancellable` storage (`VisualizerEngine.swift:536`) implement the V.7.6.2 / D-095 `PresetSignaling` subscription path. **Reset on preset switch** clears every per-preset field + every pipeline binding at the top of `applyPreset` (`+Presets.swift:48–80`) before the new preset configures its passes. The BUG-016 Lumen Mosaic apply path lives inside `case .rayMarch:` gated on `desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"` at `+Presets.swift:166–178`. Boundary verdict: **complete** (the per-preset state classes themselves are CA-Presets scope and not audited here).

### VisualizerEngine.swift (773 lines) — `production-active` + BUG-012-i1 instrumented (read-only)

The engine's primary owner type: a `final class VisualizerEngine: ObservableObject, @unchecked Sendable` constructed once at app launch by `UzumeApp.swift:23` via `@StateObject private var engine = VisualizerEngine()`. Owns the audio capture → FFT → analysis → MIR → mood → stem → render pipeline. ~30 `@Published` fields driving SwiftUI consumers. NSLock-guarded shared state (`tapSampleRateLock`, `orchestratorLock`, `stemsStateLock`, `beatSyncLock`). All Orchestrator-side handles (sessionPlanner, liveAdapter, reactiveOrchestrator, livePlan, livePlannedSession) instantiated here. BUG-015 wire inputs (`liveTrackPlanIndex`, `lastClassifiedMood`, `orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack`) declared here under `orchestratorLock`.

### VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift (581 lines) — `production-active`

`applyPreset(_:)` — the single owner of every preset-switch transition. Resets every per-preset field + pipeline binding before configuring the new preset's passes. Per-pass case statements: `.meshShader`, `.postProcess`, `.rayMarch`, `.feedback`, `.particles`, `.icb`, `.ssgi`, `.mvWarp`, `.staged`, `.direct`. **BUG-016 Lumen Mosaic apply branch at lines 166–178.** AuroraVeilState allocation OUTSIDE the switch (AV.2.2b — passes: [] for Aurora Veil).

### UzumeApp.swift (104 lines) — `production-active`

`@main` App entry. **One** `SettingsStore` instance per D-091 / Failed Approach #55. Constructs `engine`, `permissionMonitor`, `accessibilityState` as `@StateObject`; constructs `spotifyOAuth = SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider.makeLive()` as `let`. Wires `SettingsStore.reducedMotion` → `AccessibilityState.applyPreference` via `.task` Combine subscription; wires `accessibilityState.reduceMotion` → `engine.applyAccessibility` via `.onChange`. Routes `uzume://spotify-callback` to OAuth actor via `.onOpenURL`. `init()` runs `SettingsMigrator.migrate()`, `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicy.apply(policy:)`, and `DashboardFontLoader.resolveFonts(in:)`.

## Verification of BUG-015 wire shape (CA.5-specific)

The kickoff requires this section. BUG-015 was filed by CA.4 on 2026-05-20 and Resolved on 2026-05-21 in three commits (`b3f1efd9`, `5efc6a90`, `bb5e36ef`). CA.5 is the first independent audit pass to read the wire from the App-layer side.

**The wire shape matches the BUG-015 Resolved-field design notes byte-for-byte.** Verified:

1. **`runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(mir:)` declared at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:287`** — internal func; takes `mir: MIRPipeline` parameter; reads `mir.elapsedSeconds` and `mir.latestStructuralPrediction`.

2. **Called from `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:184`** — at the end of `processAnalysisFrame`, after `runMoodClassifier` (so `lastClassifiedMood` is fresh on every wire tick). Comment block at lines 178–183 explains the gate-after-mood ordering (mood is allowed to lag — defaults to `.neutral` until first classification at ~3 s).

3. **Cadence gate `analysisFrameCount % Self.orchestratorWireFrameDivisor == 0` at line 288** — `orchestratorWireFrameDivisor: Int = 30` declared at line 263. At ~94 Hz analysis queue → ~3.1 Hz wire firing. Compatible with the 30 s per-track mood-override cooldown enforced by `DefaultLiveAdapter.cooldownAdaptation(...)` per D-080 rule 3 (CA.4-verified at `LiveAdapter.swift:362-381`).

4. **Off-plan skip path at lines 298–303:** `if snapshot.hasPlan, snapshot.trackIndex == nil { return }`. The comment explains this is the correct behaviour — when `livePlan != nil` but the live track has no plan index (cover / remaster / encoding-different variant), neither session-mode patching nor reactive-mode behaviour applies; skip silently and resume on next track change.

5. **`liveTrackPlanIndex: Int?` written in `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:131`** under `orchestratorLock`. The resolution happens before the MainActor task at line 129 (`let resolvedPlanIndex = self.indexInLivePlan(matching: event.current)`), so the orchestrator wire sees the new index on the next analysis tick (~3 Hz), not on the next MainActor frame. Field declared at `VisualizerEngine.swift:505`, guarded by `orchestratorLock`.

6. **`lastClassifiedMood: EmotionalState` written in `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift:432`** (`publishMoodResult`) under `orchestratorLock`. Field declared at `VisualizerEngine.swift:513` with default `.neutral` (so the wire is well-defined before the first mood frame fires). Same lock that guards `livePlan` and `liveTrackPlanIndex` so a single `orchestratorLock.withLock` acquisition snapshots the full input set for `applyLiveUpdate(...)`.

7. **`orchestratorWireLoggedThisTrack: Bool` reset on track change at `VisualizerEngine+Capture.swift:137`** under `orchestratorLock`. Field declared at `VisualizerEngine.swift:529`. Comment block at lines 515–528 documents the latch pattern (once-per-track diagnostic, dual-write pattern matching `VisualizerEngine+WiringLogs.swift`).

8. **Once-per-track diagnostic at `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift:305–331`** — emits one `Orchestrator: wire active (mode=… planIdx=… elapsedTrackTime=…s)` line via both `sessionRecorder?.log(msg)` AND `logger.info("\(msg)")` the first time the wire reaches `applyLiveUpdate(...)` on each track. Latch logic at lines 318–322 uses `orchestratorLock.withLock` to test-and-set atomically. Closes the BUG-015 doc-vs-runtime validation gap noted in the Resolved field (existing Orchestrator `logger.info(...)` lines never reach `session.log`).

9. **The 30 s mood-override cooldown is preserved** — the wire calls `applyLiveUpdate(...)` which calls `liveAdapter.adapt(...)` which calls `cooldownAdaptation(...)` per D-080. CA.4 verified the cooldown at `LiveAdapter.swift:362–381`. CA.5 verified the wire does not bypass it; the path is straight through.

10. **The regression test `UzumeAppTests/OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests.swift` is present and load-bearing.** Two `@Test` methods:
    - `test_visualizerEngineAudio_wiresOrchestratorLiveUpdate` — reads `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift`, strips comments, asserts the file contains either `applyLiveUpdate(` or `runOrchestratorLiveUpdate(`. Either spelling is sufficient evidence that the wire reaches the live-adaptation pipeline; if both names disappear, the wire is dead again and the test fails.
    - `test_appLayer_hasProductionCallSiteForApplyLiveUpdate` — enumerates `UzumeApp/` Swift files, strips comments, counts files containing `applyLiveUpdate(`. Subtracts the declaration site (`VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift`). If zero remain, BUG-015 has regressed.

   The test strips line + block comments before counting so doc-comment mentions don't satisfy the assertion (the CA.4 grep found four doc-comment references in unrelated files; this regression test must not be fooled by the same).

**Verification criterion #2 from the BUG-015 entry** confirms the wire fires in production: Matt's session capture `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/2026-05-21T14-19-32Z/session.log` shows two `Orchestrator: wire active` lines (one pre-first-track-change at 8.2 s elapsed, one post-track-change at 0.0 s elapsed proving the per-track latch reset). 7,519 frames + 23 stem dumps in that session confirm the full audio path was alive.

**Verdict: BUG-015 wire shape is structurally correct. No App-layer regression risk identified.**

## Verification of BUG-012-i1 instrumentation (CA.5-specific)

The kickoff requires this section. Per CA.5 Hard Rules the eight BUG-012-i1 instrumented files are **read-only**. CA.5 read them freely; no edits made.

**BUG-012-i1 probe call sites verified intact across all eight instrumented files.** 48 references total via `grep -rn "BUG012Probe" UzumeEngine/Sources UzumeApp UzumeEngine/Tests --include="*.swift"`. Breakdown:

| File | Probe sites | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `UzumeEngine/Sources/Shared/BUG012Probe.swift` | The probe module itself | `production-active` |
| `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/StemFFT.swift` | Dispatch-ID allocation; in-flight counters; lock-await / lock-release log lines | Intact |
| `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/StemFFT+GPU.swift` | `runForwardGraph()` — the documented EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash site | Intact |
| `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/StemSeparator.swift` | UMA buffer-write lock-guard probes | Intact |
| `UzumeEngine/Sources/Renderer/MLDispatchScheduler.swift` | Line 190 — `BUG012Probe.log(...)` for scheduler decision tracking | Intact (extra file beyond the kickoff's explicit list; consistent with the broader BUG-012-i1 instrumentation tranche) |
| `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/ML/BUG012ConcurrencyTest.swift` | The concurrency test exercising the suspected race surface | Intact |
| **`UzumeApp/VisualizerEngine.swift`** | Line 709 `BUG012Probe.recordVisualizerEngineInit()`; line 718 (`deinit`) `BUG012Probe.recordVisualizerEngineDeinit()` | Intact |
| **`UzumeApp/VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`** | `runStemSeparation` timer entry (line 89); MainActor self=nil notice (line 96); no-scheduler queue (line 102); stemQueue.async self=nil notices (lines 104, 129, 139); `performStemSeparation` enter (line 157); separator.separate CALL (line 185) / RETURN (line 193); exit-with-outcome at multiple sites (`warmup-skip`, `silence-skip`, `ok`, `threw`, `no-separator`) | Intact |

The path is clear for the next BUG-012 reproduction. No edits were applied to instrumented files in this audit per Hard Rules.

CA.2's audit observation stands: BUG-012 step 2 (diagnosis) blocks on a fresh reproduction. CA.5's read of every BUG-012-instrumented App-layer code path produced no new candidate root cause beyond what CA.2 already documented.

---

## BUG-016 App-layer surface inventory (open diagnosis aid)

The kickoff requires inventory of the Lumen Mosaic apply path without proposing a fix. The next BUG-016 reproduction with concrete symptom is the load-bearing diagnostic step. CA.5 documents the App-layer surface and the candidate failure modes the inventory makes more / less likely.

**The apply path lives inside `case .rayMarch:` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:166-178`**, NOT a separate `.lumenMosaic:` case (the kickoff used loose phrasing). The exact code:

```swift
if desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic" {
    if let engine = LumenPatternEngine(device: context.device) {
        lumenPatternEngine = engine
        pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(engine.patternBuffer)
        pipeline.setMeshPresetTick { [weak engine] features, stems in
            engine?.tick(features: features, stems: stems)
        }
    } else {
        logger.error(
            "LumenPatternEngine: failed to allocate slot-8 buffer for preset '\(desc.name)'"
        )
    }
}
```

Plus the per-track palette refresh in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift:518-567` (`resetStemPipeline(...)` → `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack(...)`).

**Inventory observations relative to the BUG-016 candidate failure modes** (per KNOWN_ISSUES.md §Actual behavior):

- **Slot-8 binding is correct.** `pipeline.setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(engine.patternBuffer)` binds slot 8 per CLAUDE.md GPU Contract / D-LM-buffer-slot-8. Reset on preset switch clears the binding to `nil` at `+Presets.swift:69` so no stale slot-8 buffer from a previous Lumen Mosaic activation leaks across preset switches. Conclusion: **failure mode #3 (visual artifacts due to slot-8 binding bug) is less likely** from this inventory alone, but not ruled out — a binding race could still occur if `LumenPatternEngine` deallocates between binding and draw call.
- **Init can return `nil`.** `LumenPatternEngine(device: context.device)` returns `LumenPatternEngine?`. Failure logs to `os.Logger` only — no `session.log` entry — so silent init failure produces "rendered something, but not what was expected" (the most-consistent reading of Matt's `2026-05-21T13-58-07Z` capture per KNOWN_ISSUES.md line 35). Recommend adding a `sessionRecorder?.log(...)` line on the failure branch so the next BUG-016 reproduction can confirm/rule out init failure from session.log alone.
- **Per-frame tick uses `[weak engine]`.** If `lumenPatternEngine` is overwritten between binding and draw (e.g. by a concurrent preset switch), the closure's weak capture goes nil, the tick becomes a no-op, and slot 8 freezes at the last-flushed state. The audit observes the field assignment at `+Presets.swift:168` happens on MainActor inside `applyPreset`, and all consumers (`resetStemPipeline` via `refreshLumenPaletteForTrack`) also run on MainActor. No cross-actor write detected.
- **No App-layer regression test exercises the Lumen Mosaic apply path end-to-end.** `LumenPatternEngineTests` covers the GPU struct stride (`568` bytes per `LumenPatternState.stride`) only. Adding an integration test that constructs `VisualizerEngine` → calls `applyPreset(loader.preset(named: "Lumen Mosaic"))` → asserts `lumenPatternEngine != nil` and `pipeline.directPresetFragmentBuffer3 != nil` would catch silent init failure and binding regression. **This is a CA.6-or-followup question, not a CA.5 fix.**

**Verdict:** the App-layer Lumen Mosaic plumbing is structurally sound. The inventory does NOT reveal a root cause. The most-instructive next step for BUG-016 diagnosis is the concrete reproduction with symptom characterised (per the KNOWN_ISSUES.md verification-criteria #1). After the symptom is known, the App-layer suspects narrow to: (a) silent init failure (recommend log-line addition); (b) slot-8 binding race (low probability per inventory); (c) per-frame tick capture chain (low probability per inventory); (d) palette refresh on track change reading stale `stemCache` (possible — the `stemCache?.trackProfile(for: identity)?.mood` lookup falls back to mood-centre `(0,0)` when missing, biasing palette selection toward neutral-quadrant anchors).

## Cross-references

### Updates needed in CLAUDE.md

No edits to CLAUDE.md applied in this increment. The `What NOT To Do` rules referencing the App layer are all current:

- The "Do not call `applyLiveUpdate` (mood-override path) without a per-track cooldown" rule — verified the cooldown is preserved by the BUG-015 wire (see §Verification-of-BUG-015-wire-shape rule 9 above).
- The "Do not instantiate a second `SettingsStore`" rule — verified clean (see Top Finding 8 above; `SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests` is the regression gate).
- The "Do not match plan entries against the live track via lowercased title+artist string" rule — verified BUG-006.2 fix is in place at `+Capture.swift:166` via `canonicalTrackIdentity(matching:)`; `currentTrackIndex` is published via the plan walker (`indexInLivePlan(matching:)`).
- The "Do not assume the test fixture render path exercises the same GPU dispatch path the live app uses" rule (Failed Approach #66) — verified the live Ferrofluid Ocean path is reset on every applyPreset (`+Presets.swift:72 — setMeshGBufferEncoder(nil)`) so the SDF path is the live path post-round-57.
- The "Do not write the literal `44100`" rule (D-079) — App-layer reads `tapSampleRate` via the NSLock-guarded property at `VisualizerEngine.swift:253–255`; the only literals in `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift` (`StemSeparator.modelSampleRate` at line 214) and `VisualizerEngine.swift:233` (`StemSampleBuffer(sampleRate: Double(StemSeparator.modelSampleRate), ...)`) reference the model constant, not the tap.
- The "App-layer services use `Logger(subsystem:category:)` directly, not `Logging.session`" rule (U.11) — verified across all audited files. Every App-layer file uses `private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "io.uzume.mac", category: "...")`.
- The "URLProtocol stub tests require `@Suite(.serialized)`" rule (U.10) — verified the only URLProtocol-stub-using App test (`SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests.swift:98`) has the annotation.

### Updates needed in ARCHITECTURE.md

Applied in this increment as doc-only corrections:

1. **§Module Map UzumeApp/** block extended. The pre-CA.5 block listed 15 of 49 engine-adapter files. The post-CA.5 block lists every file with a one-line behavioural description, mirroring the CA.4 fix for the Orchestrator block. Categories: top-level files (14), `Services/` (30), `Permissions/` (3), `Models/` (2). The `Views/` and `ViewModels/` sub-blocks are flagged in the audit doc as CA.6 scope.

2. **§Module Map Tests/UzumeApp/** block added. Lists the load-bearing regression / contract tests: `OrchestratorWiringRegressionTests`, `SettingsStoreEnvironmentRegressionTests`, `PlaybackChromeIndexBindingTests`, `DefaultPlaybackActionRouterTests`, `CaptureModeSwitchCoordinatorTests`, `NetworkRecoveryCoordinatorTests`, `SpotifyConnectionViewModelTests`, `SpotifyKeychainStoreTests`, `SpotifyOAuthTokenProviderTests`, `PresetScoringContextProviderTests`, `LiveAdaptationToastBridgeTests`, `AppleMusicConnectionViewModelTests`, `PlaybackErrorBridgeTests`, `PlaybackErrorConditionTrackerTests`, `SessionRecorderRetentionPolicyTests`, `SettingsMigratorTests`. The CA.6 audit will inventory VM-side test files.

3. **§UI Layer** — minor: `SessionStateViewModel` description (line 224) extended to note that it also surfaces `reduceMotion` from `accessibilityState`, matching the actual constructor signature `init(sessionManager:accessibilityState:)`. Not blocking — clarification only.

No other ARCHITECTURE.md changes needed.

### Updates needed in ENGINEERING_PLAN.md

Applied:

1. **Phase CA section:** register `CA.5 (App-layer, engine-adapter slice)` as ✅ Landed under the existing Phase CA block. CA.6 added as Pending.
2. **Recently Completed:** add the CA.5 entry mirroring the CA.1 / CA.2 / CA.3 / CA.4 shape — file count, verdict counts, top findings, doc-drift corrections applied, plus the BUG-015 wire-shape verification + BUG-012-i1 instrumentation-intactness verification outcomes.

### Updates needed in DECISIONS.md

No DECISIONS.md edits needed in this increment. Every cited decision (D-046, D-049, D-050, D-052, D-053, D-054, D-057, D-058, D-061, D-069, D-070, D-074, D-079, D-080, D-088, D-091, D-095, D-097, D-LM-buffer-slot-8, D-LM-palette-library) was verified against current code with no contradictions.

### Updates needed in source-file comments

None applied in this increment. Two candidate cleanup items registered as CA.5-FU-2 (LiveAdaptationToastBridge docstring) and CA.5-FU-3 (MusicKitFetcher → ITunesSearchFetcher file rename); neither is a behavioural change so each could fold into any future App-layer-adjacent commit.

### New BUG entries

**None filed in this increment.** BUG-015 (the only App-layer-class `broken-but-claimed` finding in scope) was filed by CA.4 and Resolved 2026-05-21. CA.5 verified the resolution; no new defect filings needed.

### KNOWN_ISSUES.md sweep

No retroactive `Resolved` entries identified. No existing Open entries reproduced as no-longer-applicable.

## Follow-up Backlog

Findings surfaced by CA.5 that are *not* corrected in this audit increment. Each row is a candidate follow-up increment with enough scope to act on cold. Per the kickoff's audit-only discipline, fixes ship as separate increments scheduled whenever Matt prioritises them.

Items are greppable as `CA\.5-FU-\d+`. CA.6 (Views + ViewModels) is registered here as the natural continuation since the kickoff's recommended sub-scope split deferred it.

| ID | Scope | Done-when | Est. sessions | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CA.5-FU-1** | Decide the fate of `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `pendingEvents` field-level production-orphans (`MultiDisplayToastBridge.swift:22–23`). Two options: (a) **implement the coalescing** (handler appends to `pendingEvents`; a Task fires after 0.5 s and enqueues one toast with N-message summary; cancels and restarts on each new event) — matches the line-21 comment intent; (b) **delete both fields** and the line-21 comment — display hot-plug events arrive at human-scale cadence on Macs so the practical risk of un-batched toasts is low. Option (b) is a < 5-line change; option (a) needs ~30 lines + a test. Bundle with any future App-layer commit. | The field-level orphan is closed: either fields are consumed by working coalescing logic with a test, OR fields + comment are removed. Engine + app builds clean; SwiftLint zero violations. | <1 | Ready now |
| **CA.5-FU-2** | ✅ **Closed 2026-05-21** (Matt picked **option (b)** — stay invisible). Engine-driven adaptations intentionally do NOT toast — the visual change itself is the user-visible feedback per UX_SPEC §7.4 ("on keystroke"). Toast surface is reserved for user-initiated playback-action acknowledgements. Docstring at `LiveAdaptationToastBridge.swift:1-14` + class-level doc at `:22-26` rewritten to drop the "engine events" observation source and clarify `emitAck(_:)` is for user-action acks only. No behavioural change. | Closed. | <1 | ✅ Resolved 2026-05-21 |
| **CA.5-FU-3** | Rename `UzumeApp/MusicKitFetcher.swift` to `UzumeApp/ITunesSearchFetcher.swift` so the filename matches the contained `ITunesSearchFetcher` class. The file's top comment already states explicitly that there is no MusicKit dependency. Also: update the four pbxproj sections (`PBXBuildFile`, `PBXFileReference`, `PBXGroup`, `PBXSourcesBuildPhase`) per the U.11 learning. Verify `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp build` passes. | File renamed; pbxproj updated; engine + app builds clean; SwiftLint zero violations. ARCHITECTURE.md Module Map updated to reflect the new filename. | <1 | Ready now |
| **CA.5-FU-4 (== CA.6)** | ✅ **Closed 2026-05-21.** CA.6 audit landed as [`docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/APP_VIEWS.md`](APP_VIEWS.md) (commits `8afaddbd` audit doc + `bd2e9ae3` ARCHITECTURE.md / ENGINEERING_PLAN.md drift corrections). 59 files / 8,285 LoC; 58 of 59 `production-active`; zero `broken-but-claimed`; three small follow-ups (CA.6-FU-1/2/3) all closed same-day 2026-05-21. Four kickoff-required verifications all clean (PlaybackChromeViewModel BUG-015 / D-091 consumer chain; D-091 single-SettingsStore enforcement; DASH.7 dashboard surface against D-088/D-089; U.10/U.11 timing-margin compliance). The App layer is now fully closed. | Closed. | 1–2 | ✅ Resolved 2026-05-21 |
| **CA.1-FU-1 status update (now superseded by BUG-015 fix's actual shape)** | The BUG-015 fix routes `liveBoundary` from `mirPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` (option (b) from CA.1's framing, NOT option (a) as CA.4 recommended). The per-frame `StructuralAnalyzer` chain in `MIRPipeline.process` now has a runtime consumer — the audio-callback gate-to-prep-time fix is no longer the right action. CA.1-FU-1 should close as `superseded`. The wire is doing what option (b) intended. | CA.1-FU-1 closed in `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/DSP_MIR.md §Follow-up Backlog` and `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md §Follow-up Backlog`. No code change required. | <1 | Ready now (doc-only update to two prior audit docs) |

**Bundling recommendation.** CA.5-FU-1 + CA.5-FU-3 are < 1 session combined and would not bloat any commit. CA.5-FU-2 is a product call and should be surfaced to Matt before scheduling work. CA.5-FU-4 (= CA.6) is the natural next-priority audit increment. The CA.1-FU-1 supersede update is a 2-line doc edit and folds into the next CA-adjacent commit.

**Priority order if Matt picks one this week:** **CA.5-FU-4 (CA.6)**. The Views + ViewModels presentation slice is the largest unaudited surface in the codebase by file count (59 files) and the home of the U.10 / U.11 flake cluster. The audit format continues to produce findings; finishing the App layer closes a significant scope before CA-Renderer / CA-Audio / CA-Presets.

## Approach validation

**What worked.**

- **Direct reads + parallel Explore agents both scaled.** The engine-adapter core (12 `VisualizerEngine+*` extensions + `UzumeApp.swift` + `ContentView.swift` + `MusicKitFetcher.swift` = 15 files, ~4,200 LoC, including the biggest single file at 773 lines) was read directly with no token overflow issues. The 30 `Services/` + 5 `Permissions/` + `Models/` files (~3,800 LoC) were batched across three parallel Explore agents; each agent took ~1 minute and produced complete per-file reports. **Total Pass 1 wall-clock: ~3 minutes** for ~8k LoC. CA.3 + CA.4's "direct reads scale to ≤ 5k LoC" rule expanded cleanly to ~8k with the agent supplement.

- **Pass 0 BUG-status cross-check still cheap insurance.** Every BUG cited in the CA.5 kickoff (BUG-015 Resolved, BUG-016 Open, BUG-012 Open, BUG-001 Open, BUG-013 Open) matched `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` verbatim. No stale citation found. The Pass 0 step took ~2 minutes and would have surfaced any drift before the audit committed scope.

- **The cited-grep rule for production-orphan claims fired once and produced the audit's most-confident field-level finding.** `MultiDisplayToastBridge.coalesceTask` + `pendingEvents` — grep returned exactly two declaration sites and zero consumers across the App layer and App tests. Same shape as CA.4-FU-1's `transitionPolicy`. Falsifiable without auditor interpretation.

- **The visibility-verification grep caught one Explore agent over-assertion.** The agent's report on `SpotifyOAuthTokenProvider.swift` claimed `public protocol SpotifyOAuthLoginProviding: AnyObject, Sendable` — verified against `grep -nE "^public|^[[:space:]]+public" file` which confirmed the visibility (10 public symbols total, 1 protocol, 1 actor, 8 methods). All other audited public claims verified clean. The rule from CA.2 / CA.3 / CA.4 — visibility-verify before trusting an agent's report — held.

- **The BUG-015 wire-shape verification (the kickoff's specifically-requested section) produced 10 concrete byte-level confirmations.** Each design note from the Resolved field has a matching code citation. The regression test's two `@Test` methods are load-bearing for any future regression. The audit's confidence that BUG-015 is correctly fixed is high.

- **The BUG-016 App-layer inventory was bounded and useful.** The audit did not attempt diagnosis but produced four narrower-than-five candidate failure modes for the next reproduction to discriminate, plus one concrete recommendation (add `sessionRecorder?.log(...)` on the `LumenPatternEngine` init-failure branch). Future BUG-016 work has a clearer launch pad.

**What didn't.**

- **The kickoff's loose phrasing on "applyPreset .lumenMosaic:"** was misleading. Lumen Mosaic is gated by `if desc.name == "Lumen Mosaic"` inside `case .rayMarch:`, not by a separate `.lumenMosaic:` switch case. The audit caught the difference but a future kickoff should be more precise about whether a finding lives in a switch case or inside one. Same shape as CA.3's "kickoff prompt staleness" observation, but at the *phrasing* level rather than the *fact* level.

- **The kickoff's "8 instrumented files" claim** was slightly off — there are actually 8 files (`StemFFT.swift`, `StemFFT+GPU.swift`, `StemFFT+CPU.swift` via inheritance, `StemSeparator.swift`, `BUG012Probe.swift`, `BUG012ConcurrencyTest.swift`, `VisualizerEngine.swift`, `VisualizerEngine+Stems.swift`) **plus** `MLDispatchScheduler.swift` (one BUG012Probe call at line 190 outside the audit's documented set). The kickoff didn't list MLDispatchScheduler explicitly. The audit treated it as instrumented anyway (read-only) since it's clearly part of the same BUG-012-i1 tranche. Minor — the rule is "don't edit instrumented files" and `MLDispatchScheduler.swift` is engine-side (out of CA.5 edit scope already).

- **Sub-scope decision wording.** The kickoff said the engine-adapter slice is "~50 files" but actual count is 49 (it lists MetalView.swift twice — once at root, once noting it's in Views/; the latter is correct). Minor.

- **One trivial mis-step:** Early in Pass 2 I read the count "Listed (12)" but recounted to find it's actually 15 files listed in the pre-CA.5 ARCHITECTURE.md `§Module Map UzumeApp/` block (not 12 as I'd initially written). Corrected inline; the post-CA.5 block lists all 49.

**Recommended changes for CA.6.**

1. **Default to direct reads for ≤ 5k-LoC subsystems; parallel Explore agents work cleanly for 5–10k LoC with cross-check.** CA.5's hybrid (15 files direct + 35 files via 3 parallel agents) worked. CA.6 (~6.9k LoC across 59 files) sits in the same band — use the hybrid; cross-check every agent's claimed public symbols.
2. **Cross-check the kickoff prompt against `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` as Pass 0 (continuing rule).** CA.3 found drift; CA.4 + CA.5 found none. The cost is ~2 minutes; the value when drift is present is much higher.
3. **For CA.6, declare which App-layer state types are explicitly in / out of scope** (e.g. SwiftUI `@State` and `@StateObject` declarations inside Views vs. the ObservableObject `@MainActor` classes inside ViewModels). The U.10 / U.11 flake cluster is a known dimension where ARCHITECTURE.md drift might already exist.
4. **Recommended next subsystem for CA.6:** **App Views + ViewModels** (the deferred half of CA.5). Mid-priority. After CA.6 ships, three remaining unaudited engine subsystems are CA-Renderer, CA-Audio, CA-Presets. Order TBD per the audit-driven priority rule.

The audit format continues to produce actionable findings: 2 small follow-up items (one field-level orphan, one docstring-vs-code gap), 1 source-naming cleanup, 1 CA.6 hand-off, 1 CA.1-FU-1 supersede update, plus the BUG-015 wire-shape verification + BUG-012-i1 instrumentation-intactness verification both clean. Recommend continuing into CA.6 with the methodology refinements above; minor consolidations as noted.
