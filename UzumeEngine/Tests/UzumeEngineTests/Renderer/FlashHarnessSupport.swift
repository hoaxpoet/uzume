// FlashHarnessSupport — shared drive + luminance primitives for the photosensitivity
// flash-safety gates.
//
// Two gates consume these so they measure on identical terms (kickoff: reuse, don't
// fork): the CLEAN.7.6 single-pass `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests` (FeatureVector
// → one fragment pass) and the CLEAN.7.6c `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` (the real
// multi-pass / feedback render paths for Lumen Mosaic, Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana,
// Skein). One worst-case beat train, one matching stem train, one WCAG luminance
// reducer, one set of Harding-gate constants.
//
// The drive is synthetic-but-realistic (feedback_synthetic_audio is about *diagnostic*
// envelopes masquerading as real pipeline noise; this is a deliberate WORST CASE, the
// same rationale the single-pass gate documents): sharp, full-amplitude, impulse-decayed
// accents at a rate comfortably above the Harding 3/s limit, with deviation primitives
// spiking to the measured real p99 (~0.85) — not to an unphysical 1.0.
