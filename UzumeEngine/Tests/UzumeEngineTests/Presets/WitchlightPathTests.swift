// WitchlightPathTests — the pen, tested without a GPU.
//
// `WitchlightPath` is the whole concept: if the path is wrong the preset is wrong no matter
// how the beads are shaded. These tests drive it against synthetic driver inputs (where the
// EXPECTED geometry is known analytically) and against the real fixtures (where the
// expected numbers come from WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN §2's measurement table).
//
// Synthetic input is legitimate HERE and only here: FA #27 bans synthetic audio for
// diagnosing pipeline behaviour, and every claim about how Witchlight responds to MUSIC is
// measured on the real fixtures below. These first cases are testing a kinematic model
// against its own definition — "a constant harmonic input must produce a straight stroke"
// is a statement about the integrator, not about music.
