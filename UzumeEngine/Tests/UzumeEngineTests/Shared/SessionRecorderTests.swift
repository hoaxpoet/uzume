// SessionRecorderTests — Validate the recorder against known inputs.
//
// This exists to answer exactly one question: if a real playback session
// produces a suspicious recording (silent stems, blank video, all-zero
// features), can we trust that the recorder is faithfully capturing what
// the app produced — i.e. the problem is in the app — or is the recorder
// itself buggy?
//
// Each test drives the recorder with KNOWN inputs and verifies the outputs
// round-trip exactly. A passing run is evidence that:
//   · CSV rows contain the exact FeatureVector/StemFeatures values passed in
//   · Stem WAV files contain the exact PCM samples passed in
//   · The video file is created and readable by AVAsset
//   · Log entries are written and preserved across finish()
//   · Session directory structure matches the documented layout
//
// If a real-world recording then shows zero features during music playback,
// the recorder is not the culprit — the VisualizerEngine audio path is.
