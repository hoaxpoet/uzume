// BeatGrid — Offline beat/downbeat grid resolved from Beat This! model output.
//
// Produced once per track by BeatGridResolver during pre-analysis of the 30-second
// preview clip. Cached on CachedTrackData (Session module, S6) for instant playback
// access by LiveBeatDriftTracker.

// Lives in DSP (not Session) so that BeatGridResolver, which is also in DSP, can
// return it without creating a circular dependency (Session imports DSP, not vice versa).
// TrackProfile / CachedTrackData in Session reference BeatGrid via the DSP import.
