// LocalFilePlaybackStartRaceTests — BUG-078 regression gate.
//
// `start()` tears down any previous instance BEFORE taking the lock (BUG-021,
// so AVFoundation teardown never runs under the provider's NSLock). Two
// concurrent `start()` calls can therefore interleave as:
//
//   thread B: stop()          — snapshot is nil, nothing to tear down
//   thread A: _startLocked()  — adopts engine/player #1, still playing
//   thread B: _startLocked()  — OVERWRITES the fields with engine/player #2
//
// Instance #1 is then orphaned while running: never stopped, never detached,
// its observer never removed. Its last strong reference is the one AVFAudio
// holds inside the pending `scheduleFile` completion block, so the node is
// finally released on its own `CommandQueue` — where `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]`
// → `Stop()` → `dispatch_sync` re-enters the queue it is already running on
// and libdispatch traps the process (25 `.ips` reports, 19 naming
// `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock`).
//
// This gate does not try to catch the trap — that is timing-dependent and
// needs full-suite load. It catches the orphaning, which is deterministic
// enough to fail reliably and is the thing actually being fixed.
