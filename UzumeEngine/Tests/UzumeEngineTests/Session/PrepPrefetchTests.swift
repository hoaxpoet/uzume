// PrepPrefetchTests — PREPPERF.2 ①: the prep pipeline prefetches the network half
// (resolve + download) ahead of the serial analysis cursor. These guard the two
// behaviours that define the refactor:
//   1. Downloads actually overlap (a serial pipeline would run them one at a time).
//   2. Analysis is consumed in strict playlist order even when downloads finish
//      out of order (the StemSeparator stays serial; cachedTracks order is stable).
