// only feeds PCM into the analysis pipeline at near-real-time without
// playing audio), this provider plays the file via `AVAudioEngine` +
// `AVAudioPlayerNode` and installs a tap on the player node's output bus
// (pre-mixer, pre-volume). Uzume owns the playhead. Core Audio process
// taps are bypassed entirely — no screen-capture permission required.
