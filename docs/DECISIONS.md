# Uzume — Decision Log

Each decision records the what, why, and any relevant context that would prevent a future contributor from re-litigating it. Numbering is permanent and entries are never deleted — superseded decisions are marked as such with a pointer to the replacement, and inactive entries (shipped long ago, no longer cited by an active decision) rotate to `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md`, where they remain searchable under their D-numbers.

| D-153 | Accepted | FBS Stage 1: first-NOTE-anchored cached-tempo beat pulse, never drift-corrected |

| D-161 | Accepted | Rulebook restructure + CLAUDE.md token-budget ratchet |
| D-162 | Accepted | Doc rotation mechanized (rotate_docs.sh); budgets gated by DocIntegrityTests |
| D-163 | Accepted | Audit keep-list + executableTarget STATUS markers guard dead-code audits |
| D-164 | Accepted | Photosensitivity flash-safety enforced by measurement (cert gate now) + runtime clamp (A-next); single-pass harness validly covers 2/7 presets, rest deferred to a real-pipeline harness (clamp half closed by D-166) |
| D-165 | Accepted | Silent-tap family: detect don't churn — only rebuild a never-delivered tap; pause-suppressed card; self-healing > manual remediation |
| D-166 | Accepted | Photosensitivity runtime clamp NOT pursued (amends D-164) — the certification gate is the enforcement mechanism; pipeline has no single clamp chokepoint (8 present paths), all shipped presets ≤ 1 flash/s; `RayMarchPipeline:94` OR-flag slot reserved |
| D-167 | Accepted — **amended 2026-08-26 (RECON.19): Low Power Mode floors at `.noBloom`** | Thermal + Low Power Mode feed a quality floor into the D-057 budget governor (CLEAN.4.6): applied level = `max(timing, thermalFloor)` pre-empts the GPU's own throttle; FBM stays `ProcessInfo`-free; serious→no-bloom, critical→step-0.75, LPM→≥no-SSGI; ultra/recording still exempt |
| D-168 | Accepted | ARCHITECTURE Module Map completeness gated by DocIntegrityTests (CLEAN.7.3) — backfilled 62 undocumented files incl. 4 certified presets; D-161 "violated twice → mechanize" applied |
| D-169 | Accepted | Defer public-release-readiness work (extended a11y settings 7.7, cold-install resilience 7.8) until there's a public build; daily single-user dev use is covered by the existing a11y/robustness basics |
| D-170 | Reversed | Section detection (McFee/Ellis spectral clustering, SECDET) — built + live-tested, then **removed** 2026-06-24: structurally local-file-only (streaming has only a 30 s preview) and below the perceptual bar (live F@3 ≈ 0.29–0.41); the "no-ML" rationale was a misreading of D-009 (= no-CoreML). Planner equal-slices. See §Reversal. |
| D-171 | Accepted | Nacre — faithful port of butterchurn `$$$ Royal - Mashup (431)` (iridescent jello-mirror) onto a dedicated custom-warp+comp mv_warp branch (`RenderPipeline+Nacre`, mirroring Fata Morgana / D-139; `isNacre` discriminator). Faithful base first (NACRE.2b); the 3 greenlit uplifts deferred to NACRE.3+. Corrected source decode (mv_a-0 grid doesn't advect; volume-gated core seed; bassDev kick). **CERTIFIED NACRE.4** — connection lands via a downbeat camera push. |
| D-172 | Accepted | Floret — faithful port of butterchurn `suksma - Rovastar - Sunflower Passion` onto the dedicated `RenderPipeline+Floret` mv_warp branch (`isFloret`, the D-171 register). z² conformal warp + 1/r² vortex swirl + 3-fold radial-pulse kaleidoscope comp; motion = beat-lock downbeat magnify + energy swell + bass spin + bass-onset kick. **CERTIFIED FLORET.4** (Matt live M7). Drum sparkle tried + removed (camouflaged into the bright field). |
| D-173 | Accepted | Glaze — faithful port of butterchurn `Flexi + stahlregen - jelly showoff parade` onto the dedicated `RenderPipeline+Glaze` mv_warp branch (`isGlaze`, the D-171 register). A 3-mass spring-mass "jelly" (bass↔other stem anchor + fullness lift) drags a swirl-poke across an accreting field; 3-level blur-pyramid emboss/sheen + per-stem accents (drums punch / vocals glow) + HDR bloom; connection lands via a discrete downbeat camera push. The catalog's first physics-of-the-beat preset. **CERTIFIED GLAZE.8** (Matt live M7). |
| D-174 | Accepted | Filigree — physarum agent-network preset (`PhysarumGeometry`, a `ParticleGeometry` sibling per D-097; Kintsugi gold-on-black). Energy drives merge/divide (LOUD → fine/busy/bright web; QUIET → few calm cells) + a per-beat hit pulse + a rare re-seed burst. **Substrate verdict (Matt-accepted): physarum carries a loose energy-accompaniment, not tight event-sync** — tightly-synced cell merge/divide is reaction-diffusion's domain (a separate future preset). **CERTIFIED PHYS.5** (Matt live M7) — the first certified compute-agent-network preset. |
| D-175 | Accepted | Ricercar — contrapuntal visual-music painting preset (Fischinger / color-organ; Bach BWV 565 showcase, reusable). Ricercar.2 lands the flowing-colour-field SUBSTRATE: Skein's canvas-hold mv_warp reconfigured to a curl-noise flow warp + **decay toward a LIGHT GROUND** (a per-prefix `ricercar_warp_fragment` override — preset-side, no engine work) so the field breathes back to light at rest (silence-non-black, D-037) and matches the `02_meso` ink-plume reference. Hand-fed colour masses; voices/audio/cert at Ricercar.3.x→.7. Uncertified. **★ Substrate concept SUPERSEDED by D-176.** |
| D-176 | Accepted | Ricercar concept REVISED (Matt, 2026-06-29) — **the orchestra painting itself**: each section gets a painterly IDENTITY (colour + weight + texture + material), sync rides on top. Built on **Skein's marks-on-top painterly engine** (the elegant/luminous sibling — graceful composed strokes + Fantasia jewel-palette on a light canvas, vs Skein's chaotic earthy drip; FA #73 reuse). Abandons the D-175 flowing-colour substrate (a passive field reads as slick wallpaper, not art) AND the Filigree agent-voices + Ricercar.3.x engine bridge (use Skein's overlay marks → **no engine touch**). Five register-archetype sections. Design center = the per-section identity table in RICERCAR_DESIGN §CONCEPT. |
| D-177 | Accepted (finding; build deferred) | Instrument-family CAPTURE is feasible via on-device audio-tagging **RECOGNITION (not separation)**. Spike (2026-06-29, PANNs CNN14 on Sym5 + a Beethoven wind octet): family-level activity captures + **discriminates** strings/brass/woodwinds/percussion, tracks the music, reports absence — a leap over 4-stem (→"other") + register-proxy. Separation is unsolved for orchestra (0–4.5 dB SDR). Ceilings: family-level only, cross-family confusion on sustained timbres, buried families approximate. Scoped as a ~Beat This!-scale MPSGraph increment (`docs/INSTRUMENT_FAMILY_CAPTURE_SCOPING.md`); **DEFERRED to a fresh session pending Matt's comparison with a competing musicality idea.** Resolves Ricercar's instrument-capture hold (D-176). |
| D-178 | Accepted | Phase TONAL — continuous harmonic state via the Tonal Interval Vector (TIV; Bernardes 2016). A weighted 12-point complex DFT of the **already-computed** chroma vector per MIR frame → 5 FeatureVector floats (fifths phase, thirds phase, consonance, tension, harmonic flux). **No new ML, no new DSP stage** (consumer of `MIRPipeline.latestChroma`), 5 reclaimed pads. The palette-coherence + long-arc channel (hue on the circle of fifths, tonal tension → slow macro state), NOT a sync channel — relationships never labels, hue never brightness. TONAL.0 capability-audited (`docs/TONAL_ANALYSIS_SCOPING.md`); **Matt GO (2026-07-08), first preset = Nacre.** |
| D-179 | Accepted | Skills architecture (DOC.9) — increment-type-scoped protocols move from always-loaded CLAUDE.md to `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (progressive disclosure): closeout, defect-handling, doc-pruning, preset-session, shader-authoring. CLAUDE.md keeps cross-increment invariants + one-line pointers; each skill is canonical for what it owns and a pointer for what handbooks own. Admission test amended: skills are the preferred demotion target for increment-type-scoped rules. `DocIntegrityTests.skillIntegrity` gates presence/frontmatter/citations. CLAUDE.md 6,701 → 3,164 est. tokens. |
| D-180 | Accepted | Per-preset audio route-coverage gate (QG.1) — every preset declares its audio routes in an `audio_routes` sidecar manifest (`{route, primitive, kind}`, SHADER_CRAFT §17.1); `RouteCoverageTests` replays canonical real-audio fixtures and asserts each declared primitive fires per its kind's floor (continuous: non-constant; accent: ≥1 rising crossing/fixture; structural: ≥1 section boundary in the set). Certification requires a non-empty manifest whose routes are all green. **A red route is the gate working — file it as a defect, never tune the floor.** Mechanizes the per-route firing evidence that was a prose closeout obligation (the `vocalsPitchConfidence`-at-0%-for-5-months class). §Rationale below. |
| D-181 | Accepted | The mid-session render-comparison sheet (`Scripts/compare_render.sh`) is the mandatory pre-commit perception step for preset increments (QG.2, mechanizing REVIEW.1's 35 %-compliance prose rule). Before every tuning commit: composite the newest `RENDER_VISUAL=1` frames against the curated references, Read the sheet, write a verdict table (`trait \| reference filename \| PASS/FAIL \| what differs`), anti-reference rows mandatory. Reader-is-the-eyes — no CLIP/dHash auto-score (D-064). Enforced via `docs/PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 1 step 5; sheet is the canonical closeout §3 artifact. |
| D-182 | Accepted | Per-paradigm multi-frame harness templates (QG.4) — every rendering paradigm gets a named, env-gated (`HARNESS_TEMPLATES=1`) reference harness driving the same dispatch path the live app uses, built on a shared `HarnessTemplateCore` spine, so PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST's "write the multi-frame harness FIRST" is a copy-adapt not a from-scratch build: `mv_warp`→`AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest` (re-based on the core), `staged`→`StagedPathHarnessTemplate` (Arachne), `ray_march`→`RayMarchPathHarnessTemplate` (Lumen Mosaic), `feedback`→`FeedbackPathHarnessTemplate` (Membrane). Each captures a final-frame dHash golden + a paradigm liveness metric; each A/B-validated (a mis-bound slot / skipped pass reddens it). Env-gated, not in the default parallel run — wired into `closeout_evidence.sh`. §Rationale below. |
| D-183 | Accepted | Signal health monitor (ASH.1) — `SignalHealthMonitor` classifies input-chain health continuously from the raw pre-AGC tap into `SignalHealth` {peakBand (healthy ≥ −12 / low −15…−12 / critical dBFS), deadTap (`.silent` past a 45 s confirm, gated to process-tap modes), sampleRateMismatch (default-output outside 44.1/48 kHz)}, published to session.log + debug overlay on change. **Observes only — never steers tap recovery** (D-165 acts; D-183 classifies). Realtime-safe ingest; classification/emit off-thread. Turns the RUNBOOK triage catalog into running code. ASH.1 = engine + debug surfacing; user-facing surfacing + degraded-audio certify/record policy are ASH.2. |
| D-184 | Accepted | Signal-health surfacing + post-session chain analyzer (ASH.2). (1) **One user-facing toast**: a once-per-session `band=low` nudge (reuses `audioLevelsLow` — Spotify "Normalize Volume" copy, generic otherwise). `deadTap` is NOT toasted — the existing `AudioStallOverlayView` card already covers it earlier (~10 s) and more prominently (Matt's call); `sampleRateMismatch` stays overlay/log-only. (2) **`ChainAnalyzer`** (Shared) grades every finished session dir → `chain_health.json` + a `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=<clean\|degraded\|broken> reasons=[…]` line, run in-process at `SessionRecorder.finish()` and out-of-process via `Scripts/analyze_session_chain.sh` (retroactive grading). Verdict driven by raw_tap peak + SIGNAL_HEALTH/DRM/dead-tap log scans. (3) **Empirical finding**: the Love Rehab sub-bass onset count is **AGC-invariant** (attenuation, dynamic compression, hard limiting, −50 dB all hold ~11/5 s) — it is REPORTED, never gated. Normalization is caught by the PEAK check, not onsets. **Does not gatekeep playback** — surfaces and continues. |
| D-185 | Accepted | Aurora Veil reauthored as a **faithful nimitz "Auroras" port** (AV.7). Supersedes the AV.5 footprint direction, which reserved this D-number but was never written and never shipped. Successive AV.2–AV.6 accretions (footprint `F(x)`, 3-column parallax, band undulation, drum kink, traveling waves) were each a negotiation away from the working reference (FA #65) and each cost fidelity; all were deleted. Kept: nimitz's real 3D ray march, `triNoise2d`, running-average smear, per-step H(z) palette, his `bg`/`stars`, and his constants. Re-framed to a **static upward sky** (no horizon/ground/reflection; the camera pan was removed because it made the view-indexed stars scintillate). Reactivity is three non-competing axes: **stars→downbeat** (`bar_phase01`, gated by `pulse_amp01`, flash-safe by sparse footprint), **brightness→mood envelope** (`arousal`, clamped 0.85–1.15) with a subordinate smoothed-bass lift (`bass_att_rel`), **colour→mood** (`valence` → whole-palette phase). nimitz's source is CC-BY-NC-SA; shipped credited with Matt's explicit approval. |
| D-186 | Accepted | Glass Brutalist preset retired (GBRETIRE.1, 2026-07-19). Ray-march "brutalist corridor" concept fails the viability gate: D-020 deliberately makes the concrete audio-static, so the hero subject can never be an instrument; also 2006-tier fidelity. All preset code/tests/docs/visual-refs deleted; production count 27 → 26. See D-186 section for full rationale. |
| D-187 | Accepted | Phase RMENV — ray-march render environment as an opt-in, byte-identical shared capability: multi-light deferred lighting (up to 4; `SceneUniforms` 128→240 B), selectable IBL environment (`ibl_env`, default/gallery), and per-preset background (miss path renders the environment). Each capability is inert (byte-identical goldens) unless a preset opts in via `scene_lights`/`environment`. Fixes the "chrome reads as putty" limit that parked Kinetic Sculpture. **Intended first consumer Kinetic Sculpture was retired before opting in (KSRETIRE.1 / D-188); the capability is retained for a future consumer.** See D-187 section. |
| D-188 | Accepted | Kinetic Sculpture preset retired (KSRETIRE.1, 2026-07-20). After multiple redesigns (chrome-in-a-gallery read as a "tinker toy"; a psychedelic-iridescent pivot drifted into a different concept) the preset never found the right direction; Matt stopped it. A fresh psychedelic-geometry preset will be authored separately. **Phase RMENV (D-187) engine work is retained** for a future consumer. All KS preset code/tests/docs/visual-refs deleted; production count 26 → 25 (certified 14 — unchanged by this retirement; Aurora Veil certified at AV.7 / D-185). See D-188 section. |
| D-189 | Accepted | Truchet Loom added (PG.4.1) — a `direct`-pass multiscale curved-Truchet op-art weave (family `geometric`), the first Phase PG psychedelic-geometry preset. **Density-mapping hero**: a smoothed `spectral_flux` sets a continuous global subdivision level, so busy passages shatter the weave into nested sub-tiles and sparse passages merge them into large sweeping arcs. Ported (not derived, FA #73) from IQ's two-quarter-arc Truchet SDF + Carlson's ½-scale recursion (Shadertoy 4t3BW4). Smoothing lands via a new single-float `flux_smoothed` EMA slot (idx 3390) in `SpectralHistoryBuffer` (reused reserved region; read directly, no new binding). Drift ← `arousal` speed on an `f.time` baseline (alive at silence, D-037). `certified:false` — reviewable v1. Preset count 25 → 26. (Landed on `main` after rmenv's PR #21; originally authored as D-186 on a stale base, renumbered to D-189 at integration.) See D-189 section. |
| D-190 | Accepted | Truchet Loom rhythm + colour (PG.4.2) — three routes on distinct primitives/layers (FA #67). **Per-beat tile flips**: a bounded ~22 % hash-selected subset re-route their arc each beat, seeded by a new monotonic `beat_index` counter (SpectralHistory slot 3391, incremented on each `beat_phase01` wrap) so the re-routing EVOLVES; crossfaded over `beat_phase01`; gated by `pulse_amp01` (silent at cold-start). Orientation-swap keeps ink steady → measured beat luminance swing 0.0055 (D-157, not a strobe). **Per-path hue teams** ← `spectral_centroid` (coarse-region quantised hues → coloured ribbons). **Bounded path glow** ← `bass_dev` (drop-able). `beat_index` follows the D-189 reserved-slot pattern (no new binding). Golden regenerated. Automated gate now 3/4 (in-source `bass_dev` makes L2 pass). Preset count unchanged (26). See D-190 section. |
| D-191 | Accepted | Truchet Loom breakup polish (PG.4.3, scoped) — the §A2 "breakup" layer: (1) hue-team block edges **domain-warped** by a cheap single-octave value noise (`tl_vnoise`) so boundaries WANDER organically instead of a hard square grid; (2) subtle static paper grain. **Perf lesson:** the first cut used `fbm4` (perlin3d ×2/pixel) → p99 8.87 ms (over budget) — replaced with a 4-tap value noise (~8× cheaper), p95 ≈ 2.2 ms. **HELD for post-M7** (surfaced to Matt): deeper nesting toward cap 4 (Matt chose Restrained/cap 3 at PG.4.1) + curl-warp organic flow. Golden regenerated. `certified:false`. See D-191 section. |
| D-192 | Accepted | Audio-visual coupling metric — cross-correlation of per-frame visual delta vs. energy envelope (lags 0–500 ms, peak Pearson r + lag + sliding-window stationarity), `CouplingReportTests`, **report-first, no gate**. QG.3 baseline showed the offline single-fragment/zeroed-state render made 11/13 presets static; measurement substrate unblocked by [D-193]. Report always attached to preset closeouts, never asserted against; low coupling means "not measured as present," never "preset is bad" (M7 seat stays the coupling authority). §Rationale below. |
| D-193 | Accepted | Coupling measurement substrate — extract the photosensitivity flash gate's headless multi-pass render into a shared `MultiPassRenderHarness` (one faithful render, two consumers: flash gate + coupling report, FA #66) and drive it with the REAL reconstructed-fixture train (FA #27). Makes coupling measurable for ALL 13 certified presets (was 2). Finding: 11/13 clear their own noise floor; the floor is PER-PRESET (feedback presets autocorrelate → higher floor), not global; Nacre + Ferrofluid Ocean read weak for proxy/render-fidelity reasons, NOT defects. **QG.3.2 gate = warning tier, not a hard cert blocker** (a hard gate would false-red the two M7-approved weak-reading presets); validate the proxy against M7 felt-coupling before any blocking gate. Matt's call (QG.3.1, "make measurable first"). §Rationale below. |
| D-199 | Accepted | Cymatic Resonance CR.2 — REBUILT as vibrating sand (Matt's 3rd M7, 2026-07-22). The CR.1 figure-shader (a static nodal figure that slowly crossfades between modes) showed the RESULT of resonance, not the phenomenon — "not a clear connection between the music and the movement… so much of the reference is about resonance/vibration and yet that's not something I'm seeing… the dots look shoddy." Rebuilt (Matt chose "vibrating sand") as a `feedback+particles` preset: ~400K glowing sand grains do the **vibration-driven random walk** (Zhou et al., Phys. Lett. A 2017; ported from luciopaiva/chladni per FA #73 — step ∝ local plate amplitude + gradient-drift to nodes) on the plus-basis eigenmode field. Grains shimmer at antinodes, collect on the nodal lines, and on a mode change scatter + re-collect — the music connection is now direct/visible: loudness→vibration, `bass_dev`→burst, `spectral_centroid`→mode, `tonal_phase_fifths`→hue. New `CymaticSandGeometry` + `CymaticSand.metal`; the CR.1 direct shader + `CymaticResonanceState` retired. `certified:false`, pending live M7. §Rationale below. |
| D-200 | Accepted | Kleinian Froth RETIRED (KFRETIRE.1) — abandoned after live M7 (Matt, 2026-07-22): "complete garbage… I hate everything I see," "the entire LOOK is a failure," "the look describes BUBBLES. Where are the bubbles within bubbles?" Built KF.1 as a `ray_march` clay maquette (ported IQ Apollonian DE + sustained-bass packing morph), FF'd to main for one live test, reset back off — **never permanently landed** (count stays 26). **Two failures.** (1) *Behaviour invisible — calibration:* the hero mapped `f.bass_att`→packing tuned against synthetic [0,1] fixtures, but real `bass_att` on the test track maxed ~0.33 (p50 0.10 / p99 0.30), so packing only crept s≈1.05–1.13 (a relaxed-pole sliver) — the froth never inflated (memory: "tune vs p99, never vs 1.0" — violated; the synthetic 0/0.45/0.9 fixtures made a dead morph look dramatic). (2) *Wrong geometry + infra gap:* IQ's Apollonian renders the fractal LIMIT SET (a knobby bulb/horn gasket), NOT round nested translucent bubbles; real "bubbles within bubbles" needs a sphere-PACKING SDF (discrete spheres) **and** multi-hit transparency (see-through), which the single-hit deferred G-buffer pipeline cannot do — a Gate-2/Gate-3 miss that should have blocked the concept (the transparency risk was even flagged in the design's Gate-3 and built anyway — surfacing a risk ≠ respecting it). **★ Deep root cause:** the build was validated against the prompt's MECHANISM ("port IQ Apollonian") + green gates, never against the curated soap-foam reference sitting in the folder — homework graded with the wrong answer key. Third PG-slate preset to die at M7 (after Kinetic Sculpture D-188, Truchet Loom D-194) on the SAME reference-vs-mechanism miss. Code recoverable on branch `claude/kleinian-froth-design-04598d`. §Rationale below. |
| D-201 | Accepted | Fractal Fly-By RETIRED (FLY.14, BUG-071 closed wontfix) — abandoned after 14 rounds across two reframings (fall-in → fly-through) and the FLY.13 live M7 (Matt: "deranged movement, very jittery, still passes through walls most of the time"). **Instrument-proven ceiling, not a tuning gap:** the whole-frame temporal-coherence metric (built round 14, not round 1 — the process failure) shows the image changes ~13 % every frame uniformly, and frames two apart are *more* different than adjacent (ratio 1.12) — geometry genuinely teleports, not an aliasing artifact AA could fix. A fast scale-zoom through a self-similar Mandelbox reveals entirely new fold structure each frame, so nothing persists for the eye or MetalFX to track (it boils). Coherence needs ~3–4× slower travel (the "monotonous tunnel, BORING" Matt already rejected) and still shimmers; Horsthuis-class results come from offline accumulation we cannot afford at 7 ms/60 fps. Removed the preset + the FLY.12/13 corridor steering (`RayMarchPipeline+Corridor.swift`, FFB was its only consumer — D-097) + the `presetSteer` SceneUniforms lane (restoring the 240-byte D-187 contract; SceneUniformsTests had been RED since FLY.12, a byte-regression that merged because gate runs excluded it). KEPT dormant: MFX.1 temporal AA + RMPERF.1 (general ray-march engine work). **★ Process lesson:** measure motion coherence BEFORE tuning — the peripheral metrics (lateral jerk, mush %) that agreed with the work were the trap; a preset that can't move coherently dies in a day, not a fortnight. §Rationale below. |
| D-202 | Accepted | Beat-sync program RATIFIED (SK.1, Matt GO 2026-07-26). Beat-match/music-sync across the five hard categories (baseline 4/4, odd meters, mid-song tempo changes, dense transients, ambiguous/rubato) is elevated to its own multi-phase program (realizes the D-145 direction); [`docs/BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md`](BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md) is its authoritative spec. Four ratified inputs: (1) benchmark ground truth = human taps + reference-tool cross-check (madmom/Beat This! as offline annotation tools only, nothing ships); (2) the rolling live grid (RLG) is research-gated (RLG.0 offline study with a pre-agreed numeric GO bar) before any engine code; (3) local-file and streaming paths proceed in parallel — FT lands categories 2/3 for local files even if RLG returns NO-GO; (4) skills-first — SK.1 authors four new skills + three edits before any measurement or engine work. Phases GT/DBN/FT/RLG/TRK/CNF/MDL stubbed in ENGINEERING_PLAN.md. Standing constraints unchanged (D-004 hierarchy; Cold-Start Phase Contract + FA #69; FA #68; D-075). Downstream product decisions D-B…D-F arrive per phase (plan §5). §Rationale below. |
| D-203 | Accepted | Faraday added (FDY.1) — an iridescent liquid sea the music physically drives; roster 26 → 27, `certified:false`. A **Swift–Hohenberg simulation of parametrically-driven surface waves** (ported, FA #73: Swift & Hohenberg 1977 / Chen & Viñals 1997) runs on the GPU every frame and is ray-marched as a liquid heightfield. **Sound CAUSES the image** (the Cymatic Resonance register, not a palette on a pretty surface): loudness crossing the Faraday threshold is a real supercritical bifurcation — glassy and still below it, cells erupting above — timbre selects the cell wavelength, and the dish's own plate modes gate the drive so fine cells organise into large-scale FIGURES rather than uniform wallpaper. **Colour is optics:** thin-film interference off the wave itself, since the standing wave IS the film thickness. **First consumer of MFX.1 + RMPERF.1 by design** — interference fringes plus sub-cell capillary ripple are the finest detail there is, so a still frame must throw detail away that temporal AA accumulates instead. **Engine:** new per-frame hook `setRayMarchPreRenderCompute` (Ferrofluid, the other slot-10 consumer, BAKES its height field once; a live PDE must step on the render's own command buffer). State lives on `RayMarchPipeline` — `RenderPipeline`'s body is at its 300-line lint ceiling. **NO SceneUniforms lanes added** — time/phase derive from `accumulatedAudioTime`, so the 240-byte D-187 contract is untouched (the FLY.12 byte-regression is not repeated). `SessionReplayHarness` now steps simulated slot-10 fields too, or it renders a FLAT placeholder and every look judgement comes from an image production never produces (the FLY.6 divergence). Also removes the abandoned Molten Gyroid look-spike. §Rationale below. |
| D-205 | Accepted | **D-B ratified — BeatBench per-suite targets set against the GT.3 baseline (Matt, 2026-07-30).** Two product calls decided the shape. (1) **A grid at any valid metrical level counts as success** — visuals pulsing on every other beat still read as locked; what breaks the feel is a grid on NO real pulse. So suites 2/4 gate on **AMLt** (accepts half/double/offbeat), not strict F. Money (F 0.58 / AMLt 0.88) and Bleed (F 0.61 / AMLt 0.84) are passes, not failures. (2) **Meter/downbeat accuracy is a HARD gate**, because the certified presets already consume bar position (Nacre's + Glaze's downbeat camera push are their connection layer), so a wrong bar-1 degrades shipped visuals. Targets: **suite 1** F ≥ 0.95 ratified unchanged (measured 0.97); **suite 2** AMLt ≥ 0.85 (NOT the 0.90 first proposed — under AMLt gating 0.90 would fail Money by 0.02 despite a musically valid 2:1 reading) + meter correct ≥ 3/4 as the real work; **suite 3 DEFERRED** (re-lock latency is structurally unmeasurable against a single-BPM prep grid — needs FT + session-replay); **suite 4** AMLt ≥ 0.80 **plus a new stability target** (≥ 8/9 30 s windows within 5 % of a valid level, spread < 1.1×; baseline 6/9 and 2.11× — BUG-076); **suite 5 DEFERRED** to Phase CNF, recording barConfidence 0.55 on Clair de Lune as the start. **Baseline reality:** tempo is largely solved where ground truth is clean (Take Five 0.99, Solsbury Hill 0.97, both CMLt 1.00) while **meter is right on only 2 of 9 tracks** and downbeat F is 0.13–0.26 outside Billie Jean's 0.90 — the plan's F-first targets were measuring the healthy axis. Evidence: `docs/diagnostics/BEATBENCH_BASELINE_2026-07-30.md` + `BEATBENCH_DB_TARGET_PROPOSAL.md`. §Rationale below. |
| D-204 | Accepted | Faraday RETIRED (FDYRETIRE.1) after three live M7s — roster 27 → 26. **The mechanisms were measurably correct and the IMAGE still failed.** Round 3 verified, on rendered frames: beat legibility r = +0.748 (quarter-cycle decoy −0.659, so phase-specific), structure swinging 5.2× as cells collapse and re-form on the grid, motion 4.89/255 at coherence ratio 2.04. Matt's read was nevertheless "looks cheap and does not sync with the music." **★ The lesson is not that the routing was wrong — it is that a top-down field of slowly-breathing cells is intrinsically low-energy, and no amount of correct coupling makes a low-energy image exciting.** Round 2 had already shown the shape of it: the music drove the geometry correctly while the screen moved 1.11/255 per frame with a 7 % luminance swing. Removed: the preset + sidecar, `FaradaySimulation.swift`, `FaradaySim.metal`, the app wiring, and — per D-097 — `setRayMarchPreRenderCompute`, whose only consumer this was (deleted-concept code does not earn preservation as infrastructure awaiting the right consumer; it is ~20 lines, recoverable from git if a future simulated-field preset needs it). **KEPT — genuinely load-bearing and independent of the concept:** the HARNESS.1 repairs (stems.csv now loaded per frame, pulse fields mapped, and `ReplayHarnessRouteCoverageTests` mechanizing the silent-zero class). Those exist because Faraday's failure exposed that every replayable preset was being measured against silence. §Rationale below. |
| D-206 | Accepted | Phase TRK PARKED; DBN is the next beat-sync lever (TRK.2, Matt 2026-07-30: "park the tracker, go DBN next session"). Two levers were measured against the same frozen single-BPM grid and neither closes BUG-065: TRK.1 proved the drift is a ramp (−1.493 ms/s, R² 0.844 ⇒ 0.149 % period error) but its type-2 PI controller **regressed the real fixture** (maxAbsDrift 101.5 ms vs limit 50, alignment 0.05 vs 0.80); TRK.2's evidence upgrade is **falsified by measurement** — drums-stem sub_bass onsets within ±50 ms of a grid beat vs full-mix sub_bass: love_rehab 16.9 % vs 42.2 %, Hummer 11.0 % vs 14.4 %, `bleed.wav` 22.4 % vs 22.3 %, billie_jean 25.5 % vs 24.5 % — worse on two, a wash on two, including Bleed, the category-4 track the argument rested on. **The deciding finding:** across every capture, band and stem only ~15–25 % of detected onsets land within ±50 ms of a beat, so FA #68 generalises from sub-bass to the whole spectral-onset family and ANY tracker fed an onset flag inherits a ~75–85 % off-beat rate regardless of controller topology — the evidence layer has no headroom left. Consequences: the plan's category-4 "TRK.2" leverage entry is withdrawn (category 4 rests on DBN + MDL), TRK.3 is blocked, BUG-065 stays open and bounded, `UZUME_BEAT_PLL` stays default-off. Kept: `DrumsOnsetEvidenceTests`, the reusable "is this signal beat evidence?" instrument. §Rationale below. |
| D-207 | Accepted | **Decoder declines when the bar is unclear; meter set fixed at {3,4,5,7}** (DBN.1, Matt 2026-07-30: "decline when unsure, keep {3,4,5,7}"). Two product calls on the bar-pointer decoder. (1) When the decoder cannot tell what the bar is, the visuals **decline** rather than guess — bar position drives Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat pushes (D-171, D-173) and the GT.3 baseline has `beatsPerBar` wrong on 7 of 9 tracks, so a wrong bar-1 is already firing on an arbitrary beat; the plainer reading beats the wrong one, consistent with D-205's hard-gate call and category 5's "success = declining honestly". (2) `dbnMeterHypotheses` = {3,4,5,7}, **fixed** — covers every ground-truth meter plus waltz; {6,9,12} are ambiguous with {3,4} at another metrical level and risk a 4/4 track relabelled 12/8. **Consequences:** the decoder's output becomes "a meter OR no confident bar" (a bar-confidence flag joins the output contract — `beatsPerBar` alone cannot express it); the meter-margin confidence becomes load-bearing rather than diagnostic; DBN.2 ships the decline path with a threshold set from the margin's measured distribution, not taste; DBN.3's A/B gains a **decline-rate** metric so declining on everything cannot read as a win. **Explicitly NOT chosen:** per-preset fallback gestures — presets that lose the bar accent keep beat-level motion, and the graded version belongs to CNF.2 (D-154 evolution), not phase DBN. §Rationale below. |
| D-208 | Accepted | **D-E resolved — `final0` NOT adopted** (MDL.1, Matt 2026-07-31: "don't adopt final0"). small0 remains the shipped grid model. Measured on 9 ground-truthed tracks through the real MPSGraph path: meter correct **2/6 for both** variants (final0 gains bohemian_rhapsody, loses bleed — a trade), mean downbeat:beat ratio 0.494 → 0.475 (4 %, and inconsistent), at ~10× the weights (8.4 → 81 MB) and ~1.3× steady-state inference; **`bleed`, the suite-4 case the plan expected final0 to fix, REGRESSES** (BPM doubles 115.00 → 259.43, meter 4 ✓ → 2 ✗). **The corollary is the load-bearing part: the evidence ceiling DBN.2 hit is NOT a capacity problem.** With TRK.2 (onsets falsified) and DBN.2 (unbiased decoder still hairline), the program has now established three independent ways that the downbeat evidence is thin and not thin because of how it is read — so **DBN.3 should not open as specified**, since A/B-ing a decoder with known-wrong odd meters and a non-separating confidence signal would measure the deficiency rather than the decoder. **AMENDED same day:** the original "needs a changed premise" was overstated — every measurement behind it came from a 30 s window (money's meter was decided from 51 beats of a 380 s track), so **FT.1 must lift the `tMax` clamp and re-test before any model-family question is opened**. Retention stated per D-097: `Variant` + `weightsDirectory` + `Final0ABTests` kept as the reproduction of a committed measurement, with an explicit deletion trigger. §Rationale below. |
| D-209 | Accepted | **Witchlight — Milkdrop-inspired uplift concept, D-121 divergence axis, and flash budget** (WL.1, Matt 2026-07-31). Inspiration source `martin - witchcraft reloaded`. **Divergence axis: dominant motion model, and consequentially palette character** — the pen tip's path is a function of the track's harmonic and spectral motion (chord changes turn the stroke; the figure hanging in the dark is a drawing of the last thirty seconds), and each bead's hue records where the harmony was when it was laid down. Same register as the source (beaded luminous line, dark sky, violet bloom, bright head); different motion, and the difference is trivially demonstrable side by side. **Founded on measurement, not on the feature's name:** `tonal_phase_fifths` measured alive on four real captures (three route-coverage fixtures + an 88-minute live session), so the documented palette-and-sky fallback was not triggered. Three measurement findings outlive the preset — `pulse_amp01` is a **silence gate, not a driver** — at 1.000 on 98.7 % of 318 383 live frames, exactly as the capability registry documents; `pulse_phase01` is the steady-pulse driver and is alive; `harmonic_flux` / `tonal_tension` / `section_index` are alive live but near-flat on 2 of 3 offline fixtures; `spectral_centroid` reads 0.04–0.21 (BUG-027 / CR.1.1, third sighting). **Flash budget, designed up front against the source's frame-filling whiteout:** 0.00 flashes/s target, peak full-frame mean luma ≤ 0.35, max Δluma/frame ≤ 0.06, flare ≥50 %-peak area ≤ 3 %, ≥10 %-peak area ≤ 12 %, ≥ 900 ms hard refractory, ≥ 60 ms rise / ≥ 200 ms fall. **Two level-3 grounding ratings accepted, not hidden.** **Amended 2026-07-31 (WL.2/WL.3 integration) — §3.1's heading model was falsified and replaced by a circular-DEVIATION steer, reached independently by two parallel sessions.** §Rationale below. |
| D-210 | Accepted | **Wrong metrical level → decline the bar, keep the beat** (FT.3.1 §10, Matt 2026-07-31: "decline the bar, keep the beat"). When Uzume's grid runs at double or half the pulse a listener would tap, presets get **no bar position** and fall back to their energy-driven behaviour; the beat layer is untouched. Resolves a tension inside D-205, which gates beat *feel* on AMLt on the explicit grounds that a half/double grid "still reads as locked", while making bar position a **hard** gate because Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat pushes consume it (D-171, D-173). **FT.3 measured those two as incompatible:** the two ground-truthed tracks with a large AMLt−CMLt gap — money (CMLt 0.00 / AMLt 0.88; grid 116.19 BPM vs truth 60.97) and bleed (0.03 / 0.84; grid 115.00 vs truth 226.72) — are **exactly** the two where bar-line phase failed with the meter correct (0 % and 16 %), while all three zero-gap tracks got phase right. A grid at the wrong level still feels locked and makes the bar line unrecoverable. **Explicitly NOT chosen: correcting the level.** money wants halving at 116 BPM and bleed wants doubling at 115 — same tempo, opposite corrections — so no global BPM threshold separates them, and moving `BeatGrid.halvingThresholdBPM` (175, halving-only since QR.1) re-opens BUG-009 on fast rock. Correction returns as an option only if FT.3.1 task 5 shows a near-zero confident-wrong rate. Extends D-207's "a meter **or** no confident bar" contract to a second decline reason. Evidence: `docs/diagnostics/FT3_BARLINE_TASKS_1_3_2026-07-31.md`, `docs/diagnostics/BEATBENCH_BASELINE_2026-07-30.md`. §Rationale below. |
| D-211 | Accepted | **Reference/diagnostic images leave git; the LFS purge is a separate, explicit step** (LFS.2, Matt 2026-07-31). Raster images under `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` + `docs/diagnostics/` are gitignored and **untracked** — dev-only material no build target reads. Supersedes an earlier attempt that added the `.gitignore` rules but never ran `git rm --cached`: because gitignore does not affect already-tracked paths, dropping the LFS filter converted 189 pointers into real blobs and would have added **~100 MB to git history** (25.7 KB → 100.6 MB measured) while leaving the LFS objects — and the bill — in place. **Untracking stops NEW objects; it does not reclaim the old ones.** GitHub does not GC unreferenced LFS objects, so reclaiming storage needs a history rewrite (`Scripts/reclaim-lfs-visual-refs.sh`) followed by a GitHub Support purge request — deliberately NOT done here. Text records in those dirs stay in git. Worktree consequence handled: `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` now symlinks the images too, since the preset workflow is "read the README and LOOK at the images" and a worktree without them degrades silently rather than failing. §Rationale below. |
| D-213 | Accepted — executed (RECON.14, 2026-08-25) | **Delete the zero-consumer dormant capabilities — RMENV.2/.3 gallery environment + MFX.1 temporal upscaler** (RECON, Matt 2026-08-03). Both were kept as "reusable capability, no consumer yet" (D-187, D-201). The production audit measured the consumer count as **zero and structurally so**: no preset sets `"environment"` in any of the 28 sidecars, so `environmentType` is always 0 and `ibl_gallery_env()` is unreachable — and **KSRB.2, the production wiring that would let a preset opt in, was never built**, so there is no path by which a preset could use it today. MFX.1's motivating preset (Fractal Fly-By) was retired at D-201. Applies the **D-203** precedent — the stage light rig was fully decommissioned once its consumer was stopped: *good work is not a reason to keep code with no consumer.* **RMENV.1 multi-light (`scene_lights`) is explicitly RETAINED** — three live consumers (Ferrofluid Ocean, Lumen Mosaic, Volumetric Lithograph). Cost is optionality only; nothing executes these paths today, and both are recoverable from git. **Decided, not executed** — the deletion touches the four-way 240-byte `SceneUniforms` mirror and the GPU contract, so it needs its own increment. Supersedes the retention halves of D-187 and D-201. §Rationale below. |
| D-212 | Accepted | **Fractal Tree keeps the low-fidelity look; V.10 painterly uplift cancelled, its reference set transfers to Goldengrove** (FTR.1, Matt 2026-08-03). Matt: *"I like the low-fidelity look, but ... it will need to react to the music more accurately and more strongly."* Reclassified `rubric_profile: lightweight` (Plasma / Waveform / Nebula / Spectral Cartograph precedent) because the `full` rubric's M3 >= 3-distinct-materials gate is **unreachable by construction** for a flat-HSV mesh preset with no lighting and no G-buffer -- certification was blocked by classification, not by quality. **Measured on session `2026-08-03T15-05-43Z` (Hummer, 2695 frames):** of five declared audio routes, three are dead on real music -- canopy spread <- `mid_att` delivers **0.42 deg** of swing against a promised 7 deg, tip shimmer <- `treb_att` delivers **+0.002** brightness against a promised +0.12, and leaf hue <- `spectral_centroid` delivers **4.1 deg** while the `fract(t * 0.006)` wall-clock term in the same line sweeps **76 deg** (clock out-drives music **18.6 : 1**). The three live layers all read the SAME primitive, `bass_att` -- an FA #67 collision -- and `bass_att` rises **+0.024** on a 100 ms transient where raw `bass` rises **+0.141** (**5.8x** less responsive), which is the "not sensitive enough". The per-branch activation effect Matt likes is an **artifact**: there is no per-branch state, only a global `branch_count` truncating a breadth-first index list, changing on 12.1 % of frames. FTR.2-FTR.5 rebuild the routing and build that activation deliberately (Option A, stateless beat-grid). See Rationale below. |
| D-232 | Accepted | **The design system reaches the app as a VENDORED copy, and Uzume is always dark (DS.1, 2026-09-01, Matt chose A).** [D-228] makes `uzume-site` the design-system source of truth, but the app may not take a package dependency on it: a fresh clone and CI would then need a second repo present, and the app is the thing that has to build. So `UzumeApp/DesignSystem/UzumeTokens.swift` is a byte-identical copy of `uzume-site@03d5478`'s token file under a provenance header (repo, path, commit, SHA-256), and `Scripts/check_design_token_drift.sh` is the cost made visible: it verifies the vendored body against its recorded hash always, and against the upstream file when a sibling checkout is present — `SKIP`/0 when it is not. **The price is a manual re-sync**, accepted because tokens change on the order of once per design increment and a silent divergence now fails a script instead of being discovered in a screenshot. **App-only roles never go in the vendored file** — they live in `UzumeTokens+App.swift`, each commenting the `--color-*` name it was transcribed from, so any app colour greps back to a line of `tokens.css`. **Uzume is always dark:** every screen keeps the near-black canvas whatever macOS is set to, so the engine's output is the only bright thing in the frame and the ≥4.5:1 overlay measurement stays valid against one appearance. That diverges from upstream — the Swift package builds on adaptive AppKit system colours and `tokens.css` publishes a full light palette — so the app pins its roles to the DARK block and the app root sets `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`; light-appearance support is a real increment with its own review, not a side effect of a token swap. Two upstream disagreements found and recorded rather than papered over: the package's system-colour mapping resolves to **neither** palette (`.windowBackgroundColor` in dark appearance is far lighter than `--color-canvas` #0b0c10), and `UzumeRadius` (6/10/14) agrees with `--radius-*` (6/12/16) only on the smallest rung. §Rationale below. |
| D-242 | Accepted — **amended at PREP.2 (2026-09-04): two budgets, and Release is the configuration they are measured in**; see §Amendment | **Session preparation has a time budget: 40 tracks in 5 minutes (Matt, 2026-09-03).** Preparation had no stated performance target anywhere in the docs — it was measured only as "did every track land". Matt set one after a live local-file run: **12 FLAC files took 10 minutes**, i.e. **50 s/track**, against a ceiling of **7.5 s/track** (300 s ÷ 40). The current local path is therefore ~**6.7× over budget**, and the gap widens with playlist length because the outer loop is serial. The budget is wall-clock from the first preparation task starting to the session reaching `.ready`, on the Mac mini dev target, cold cache, and it applies to **both** sources — though they are structurally unequal: streaming analyses a 30 s preview per track while the local path decodes and analyses the **entire** file (LFSTEM.1's whole-file stem sweep, DYN.1c's loudness profile), so local is the path that has to close the gap. Why it is a product commitment and not a nice-to-have: Uzume's proposition is that the whole visual session is planned before the listener presses play, and the wait is the one unavoidable friction that buys it — a wait that scales to ~30 minutes for a real 40-track playlist makes the proposition unusable, whatever the visuals do afterwards. **The number is a target, not a measurement:** no per-stage timing exists for the local path, so which stage dominates is unknown and must not be guessed. PREP.1 instruments before anything is optimised (evidence-before-implementation). §Rationale below. |
| D-243 | Accepted | **Bar position is recorded per window, and a declined window emits no bars** — sparse and correct over dense with a fallback (Matt, 2026-09-05) |
| D-244 | Accepted for uncertified review | **Root Choir keeps harmonic geometry on a compact stateful direct path** — five ordered Newton roots, CPU circular phase smoothing, stable root-colour identity (ROOTCHOIR.1, 2026-09-09) |
| D-241 | Accepted — M7 passed 2026-09-03 | **The performance chrome is retokenized in place, and after inactivity it is gone completely (DS.6, 2026-09-03; Matt's call on the inactivity question, the prompt's defaults on the other two).** `PlaybackChromeView` and its children stay the composition they were and are drawn from the design system only: no colour outside `UzumeAppColor`, `DashboardTokens` confined to `Views/Dashboard/`, no second control tree. (1) The track card's "Planned"/"Reactive" pill is **removed** — it reported the session's structure, which the surprise model ([D-238]) keeps from the listener; `OrchestratorDisplayState` is deleted. (2) **After 3 s of inactivity the chrome disappears completely** — Matt: *"Chrome should disappear completely after a brief period of inactivity so that the user can focus on the visuals. When mouse activity is detected or the user taps the screen, the chrome returns."* Nothing stays on screen; mouse movement, a tap, any key press and a track change bring all of it back; Space toggles it. This is a deliberate deviation from `COMPONENTS.md`'s "cannot become undiscoverable", recorded upstream as a product decision for `uzume-site` to adopt. (3) **Track information is a preference**, `uzume.settings.visuals.showTrackInformation`, default shown, persisted; the cluster's "Show/Hide track info" control (the DS.4a words, [D-239]) and Settings move the same value; hidden means the card, its artwork and the track-change announcement are gone from the tree. (4) Tap, **key press and track change** restore the chrome — UX_SPEC §7.2 had promised key and track change; only the mouse was wired. (5) The first hide timer waits for the arrival ([D-240]) to fade before its 3 s. (6) State changes take the design system's 240 ms exponential ease-out (`UzumeAppMotion`, app-side because the vendored tokens carry no motion); reduced motion crossfades. (7) "Still preparing" is a status placement: `StatusTone.info` on its opaque field, not a colour of its own ([D-234]). (8) The transport bar takes `--shadow-raised` and loses the purple glow. Backdrop numbers unchanged; `PresetContrastCertificationTests` untouched. §Rationale below. |
| D-240 | Accepted — M7 passed 2026-09-03 | **Ready is the arrival — two ready experiences, one camera push (DS.5, 2026-09-03, Matt's design pass + live prototype approval).** Local-file sessions never saw `.ready` — `ContentView` routed them straight to `PlaybackView` (an LF.4 shortcut) while the engine's `.ready` observer started the audio in the same tick — and `ReadyViewModel` knew only `PlaylistSource?`, so it would have read "press play in your music app" had it been shown. Now the cave from preparation is fully open behind both ready screens (`OpenAperture`); streaming keeps its waiting room (press play in the named app, first-audio detection and the 90 s timeout unchanged) plus a bordered **"Begin now"**; local files get a **3-2-1 countdown** (`LocalFileCountdownView`) with no app named and no timeout, and `handleLocalFileReady()` moves from the `.ready` observer to the countdown's end so the count runs over silence. "Start now" always lands on `.ready`. On entry to `.playing` one camera push runs for both sources — `ArrivalPushScene`: the real aperture under a 100-streak parallax burst, whiteout, hold, fade to the live render — after a redrawn approximation and a uniform zoom were both rejected live; it is a `Canvas` construction, not a GPU pass, correcting the design doc's forecast. Flash maxΔ/frame 0.0174 (gate 0.05, D-157). Plan preview deleted outright (views, VM, sheet, `P` shortcut, strings), executing D-238's ruling; `ReadyPulsingBorder` retired. M7 (same day): Ready self-advanced with no audio — the tap was only ever installed after `.playing`, so the detector had always watched a default `.active` (BUG-112); the tap now comes up at `.ready` with the surface reset to `.silent`. Copy contrast: a scrim under the words, not a halo. §Rationale below. |
| D-239 | Accepted | **The preparation-view toggle is a destination-labeled button, not a segmented control (DS.4a, 2026-09-02, Matt's live feedback).** DS.4 shipped with Settings unreachable while `.preparing` (the gear lives in playback chrome, which doesn't exist yet) and only a one-way, failure-gated tap to switch views. Three label shapes for a segmented control were tried and rejected — `Mysterious`/`Detailed` (undecodable without context), `Simple`/`Detailed` (still a bare word carrying a whole mode), `Ambient`/`Tracks` (still metaphor-adjacent, and most listeners don't know the brand story) — because the *component* was wrong: a segmented control names both states at once, and these two views aren't opposite settings of one axis. The fix is a single bottom-bar button reading **"Show track info"** / **"Hide track info"**, named for the destination rather than the current mode, so it only ever has to describe one thing. |
| D-238 | Accepted (M7 pending) | **The preparation screen is the overture — one opening, two views, the listener chooses (DS.4, 2026-09-02, Matt's design pass).** Matt's bar: *"i want people to feel entertained and excited during preparation."* `PreparationProgressView` is rebuilt in place around two views behind `uzume.settings.visuals.preparationView` (default **mysterious**): the cave (`PreparationAperture`) — shut until the first track is heard, a pinprick then, widening through the engine's **four readiness stops** (not the fraction complete, which is 7.5 % when "Start now" unlocks at forty tracks), the identity's **full prism** spilling in every direction and more vibrant as it opens, never naming a track, the list hidden and failures surfaced as a count line that opens the other view; and the list (`PreparationTrackRow` + `PreparationStatusIndicator` in `Views/Components/`) reporting what Uzume **heard** — tempo, key, mood, stem balance — with per-row failures still inline. Hue is identity, not data: exactly one loop of violet → cyan → gold → ember; the playlist changes how the light *behaves* (`PreparationCharacter`: churn, rate, edge, ribbing vs wash, waver — from heard profiles only). Prerequisite: `SessionPreparer` publishes `trackProfiles` beside `trackStatuses`. Both views bound by heard-vs-will-do. Flash-safe by measurement (maxΔ/frame 0.0100 vs the 0.05 gate, D-157); reduced motion snaps to the stop and still widens; the cave is one VoiceOver element carrying every fact the light conveys; preparation wall time measured against `main` in `docs/reviews/DS.4/TIMING.md`. DEAD-002 decided: the banner's dismiss affordance is **deleted**. DS.5 inherits whether the opening persists into `.ready`. §Rationale below. |
| D-237 | Accepted | **The banner's three errors do not share a severity, and the split follows the CTA (DS.3b, 2026-09-01, Matt's call).** DS.3 gave the banner a tone for the first time and every reachable banner came out **info blue** — faithful to the model and wrong about the product. The cause was not the mapping: **all three errors routed to `.topBanner` sat on the `default: return .info` arm** of `UserFacingError.severity`, named nowhere in that switch, and the hard-coded amber banner had concealed it for as long as it existed. The split now follows a distinction the code already made — **does the user have anything to do?** `previewRateLimited` **stays `info`**: it auto-retries (`retryStatus == .autoRetrying()`) and has **no `primaryCTAKey`**, so blue is the honest colour and this one was never mis-rated. `preparationSlowOnFirstTrack` and `preparationTotalTimeout` become **`warning`**: both carry `primaryCTAKey == "cta.start_reactive_mode"`, and `ErrorSeverity.warning`'s own definition is *"User may want to act, but the session can continue"* — literally these two. The banner consequently reaches the token warning treatment DS.3 originally predicted, but by correcting a classification rather than by painting over it, and it now carries **two** tones — which is what [D-234] gave it a tone for. Pinned by `test_bannerErrors_severitySplit`, which also pins the deliberate `info` so a later reader does not "fix" it. §Rationale below. |
| D-236 | Accepted | **Sustained silence is fatal, and the toast vocabulary gains the `fatal` case it was missing (DS.3a, 2026-09-01, Matt's call).** DS.3 made the *"No audio detected."* toast yellow by reading the model — and that exposed the real defect: the toast had been red only because `PlaybackErrorBridge:287` **hard-coded `severity: .degradation` at the call site**, while `UserFacingError.severity` rated `silenceExtended` a mere `warning`, *milder than a dropped stem*. The pixels and the taxonomy had disagreed about silence for months, in the opposite direction anyone would guess. Matt's judgement — *"Uzume ceases to function without audio"* — is the correct reading: the visuals are audio-driven, so sustained silence means the product has stopped delivering even though the render loop still runs. **Three changes.** (1) `silenceExtended` → `.fatal`. It stays condition-bound and still clears itself when audio returns — `fatal` here describes what the user is (not) getting, not whether the process can proceed. (2) `UzumeToast.Severity` gains `fatal`, mirroring `ErrorSeverity` one-for-one, because the bridge was **folding `.degradation, .fatal` into `.degradation`** — the distinction died in the narrower enum before any view could see it, which is precisely why [D-234] could not fix this from the view layer. (3) The `ErrorSeverity → UzumeToast.Severity` mapping moves onto `UzumeToast.Severity.init(_:)`, so no call site chooses a toast severity by hand again. `ToastManager`'s never-drop rule covers `fatal`; VoiceOver gains *"Critical"* alongside *"Alert"*. **This crossed DS.3's stated boundaries deliberately and with approval** — DS.3 was barred from changing `ErrorSeverity`, `UzumeToast.Severity`, or any error's severity, and this changes all three. §Rationale below. |
| D-234 | Accepted | **One severity vocabulary: `StatusTone` maps both source enums onto the published status roles (DS.3, 2026-09-01).** Three surfaces each mapped severity to colour inline and disagreed. `StatusTone` (`info`/`success`/`warning`/`danger`) is the single answer, resolving each tone to a `--color-status-*` triple from the vendored source ([D-232]) plus one SF Symbol, dark block only. It maps *from* `ErrorSeverity` (engine-owned) and `UzumeToast.Severity` (app-owned); **neither source enum changes** — unifying them has engine reach and is not this increment. **The four placements stay four components** — `NoticeBanner`, `InlineNotice`, `PerformanceToast`, `RecoveryScreen` — because interruption, lifetime and dismissal differ; sharing the tone vocabulary is the whole of the sharing (`COMPONENTS.md` § Status placements). `RecoveryScreen` absorbed two predecessors, one of which (`FullScreenErrorView`) **had no construction site and had never shipped** (DEAD-003), so that half of the merge carried zero behavioural risk. All five accessibility identifiers keep their `preparation.*` spelling despite the renames — an identifier is a contract, not a description — and are pinned by `StatusPlacementIdentifierTests`. §Rationale below. |
| D-235 | Accepted | **Degraded operation reads as caution, not alarm (DS.3, 2026-09-01, Matt chose A).** `degradation` rendered yellow on the full-screen surfaces and red in toasts — one severity, two opposite readings, because two authors wrote two maps. It now maps to `warning` everywhere. The reasoning is the severity's own definition: *"Uzume is operating in degraded mode"*, explicitly not *"the session cannot continue"*. Reserving `danger` for `fatal` keeps red meaningful — a red toast raised while the visuals are still playing teaches people to ignore red. **The one visible consequence** is that the *"No audio detected."* toast goes red → yellow. If silence should shout, the fix is to reclassify `silenceExtended` as fatal, not to make all degradation red. A fifth tone between warning and danger was rejected: the design system does not publish one, and inventing palette is what [D-232]'s vendored-token discipline exists to prevent. **Discovered while implementing, and NOT settled here:** the three errors routed to the banner all carry `info`, not `warning`, so every reachable banner is now blue — correct per the severity map, larger than the increment predicted, and a question for the engine's severity assignments rather than for presentation. §Rationale below. |
| D-233 | Accepted | **One tile component carries four source affordances (DS.2, 2026-09-01).** `ConnectorTileView` and the private `LocalSourceActionTile` encoded the same family twice — same layout, same `"Title. Subtitle."` accessible label — and differed only in hover behaviour and trailing content. They are replaced by `SourceChoice`, carrying navigation, immediate action, unavailable-with-a-reason, and unavailable-with-a-recovery-action. **The component owns no state and never constructs a `NavigationLink`**: the `.navigation` affordance draws the chevron and the consumer wraps it, so `ConnectorPickerViewModel` keeps sole ownership of `connectorPath` and the two connection wrappers keep their `@StateObject` lifetimes (CA.6-FU-3). `ConnectorType` keeps title, subtitle and symbol — product content, passed in, not absorbed. **Two deliberate behaviour changes**, both consequences of having one component instead of two: the connector tiles gain the hover treatment only the local tiles had, and the local tiles gain a VoiceOver hint only the connector tiles had (`"Opens a file chooser"`) — a blind Curator previously got guidance on the first source screen and silence on the second. The component lives in `UzumeApp/Views/Components/`, not `DesignSystem/`: that directory holds the vendored token source, and a component authored here is app-owned until `uzume-site` adopts it ([D-228]). §Rationale below. |
| D-231 | Accepted | **Runtime string identity completes the rename: persisted keys migrate, shader/preset prose sweeps (RN.6, 2026-09-01).** Closes the last two of [D-227]'s four deferred surfaces. **(1) Persisted `UserDefaults` keys** — all 11 (`phosphene.settings.*` ×8, `phosphene.lf.recents`, `phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`, `phosphene.cache.localFile.maxBytes`) become `uzume.*`, each paired with a `SettingsMigrator` entry **in the same commit**, because a rename without a migration silently resets every setting on the first post-rename launch — the exact failure RN.2 refused to ship. The pre-scheme U.6 key is retargeted straight at its `uzume.*` destination so no entry depends on another running first. **(2) Shader comments + preset sidecars** — 22 `.metal` comment hits and 5 `.json` descriptions, all prose, zero code: verified by grepping every changed `.metal` line for a comment marker and by the preset **golden-hash regression suite passing unchanged**, which is the real proof that rendering did not move. RN.2's "do not edit shaders or presets" constraint was scoped to that increment; this one opens under the `preset-session` skill. §Rationale below. |
| D-230 | Accepted | **On-disk output paths renamed to `uzume_*`; code and data moved together (RN.5, 2026-08-31, Matt's go).** RN.2 deferred these as user-visible. Renamed: `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/` → `uzume_sessions/` (5.7 GB, 16 captures), `~/phosphene_beatbench_fixtures/` → `uzume_beatbench_fixtures/` (946 MB, 21 fixtures), `phosphene_soak`, `phosphene_features.csv`, `phosphene_diag.log`, `/tmp/phosphene_visual`, and the ephemeral test-temp prefixes. **The code sweep and the `mv` are one operation** — doing either alone orphans 6.7 GB of captures from the tools that read them. **Not renamed:** `phosphene_grid_bpm` (a key *inside recorded BeatBench ground-truth fixtures* — renaming edits recorded evidence), `~/phosphene-ml-env` (Matt's venv), the Extreme-SSD corpus manifest, and `phosphene_section_lab`/`phosphene_session_mining` (external workspaces cited only in historical rationale) — all external artifacts this repo does not own. ~250 references in `docs/diagnostics/` and `docs/prompts/` keep the old paths: they are frozen records of past runs, the same trade [D-227] made. §Rationale below. |
| D-229 | Accepted | **The pre-publication history rewrite is RETIRED, not deferred (RN.4, 2026-08-31).** `PUBLISHING.md` §2 was CONFIRMED on 2026-07-12 — "run once, before first publish" — on the explicit premise that **"pre-publication is the one moment a rewrite is free (no external clones exist)."** The repo was published without it, so the premise expired. Measured before deciding, not asserted: the payload is one **non-routable** `.local` hostname (`braesidebandit@Matthews-Mac-mini.local`, 1684 commits — `.local` is mDNS, it cannot receive mail; it leaks a username and a machine name) and one **already-public** business address (`matt@plaitandpattern.com`, 183 commits; plaitandpattern.com serves 200). Against that: a rewrite invalidates **30 commit SHAs cited across DECISIONS / ENGINEERING_PLAN / KNOWN_ISSUES / release notes** — the project's own evidence trail — breaks all 11 local worktrees plus the Codex clone, and requires temporarily disabling `main`'s branch protection, which CLAUDE.md treats as a stop signal. Cost high, benefit ~zero. **New commits already add no exposure** (`user.email` is the GitHub noreply). Two things WERE fixed without a rewrite: PUB.1's own changelog was re-publishing the `matt.deming@gmail.com` it recorded redacting, and §2's filter-repo recipe quoted it a third time — both now say "personal gmail". §Rationale below. |
| D-228 | Accepted | **`uzume-site` is the brand/design source of truth; the app owns product facts (RN.3, 2026-08-31).** Each repo owns what it can verify: the site owns brand story, voice, palette, the First Opening design system, production identity assets and public copy; the app owns product behaviour, engineering decisions, contributor commands, and **whether any claim is true of the shipped build**. The app's `docs/planning/` becomes a **frozen RN.0 snapshot** — the site's copies are live. Three corrections flowed site-ward from app ground truth: the site's naming/website plans carried the **pre-2026-08-12 domain call** (uzume.app "available and canonical", bundle ID `app.uzume.mac`) against the registrar-confirmed reality (uzume.app parked, **uzume.io canonical**, shipped ID `io.uzume.mac`); "certified presets are measured at **0 flashes per second**" has **no basis in this repo** (the real gate is [D-157] steady luminance — a bounded max per-frame brightness change) and was published in four places; and "free, open-source **public beta**" overstates a repo that is not public with no signed or notarized build ([CLEAN.2.5b] is blocked on a paid Apple Developer membership). Two corrections flowed app-ward: the README's name sentence still explained the **phosphene phenomenon** under the name Uzume (an RN.2 sweep orphan — no `Phosphene` token in it, so no lexical scan could catch it), and the **"AI orchestrator"** framing the site retired as a product claim survived in README + CLAUDE.md though the planner is deterministic and rules-based. §Rationale below. |
| D-227 | Accepted | **Internal tree renamed to Uzume; runtime string identity deliberately left behind (RN.2, 2026-08-31).** Directories, Xcode targets/scheme, Swift packages/products, the app module, test host and bundle, env vars, scripts, CI and living docs all move to Uzume. **`PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME` is repointed to `UzumeApp`, not unpinned** — unpinning would make the module `Uzume` (from `PRODUCT_NAME`), which no longer matches the target; `PRODUCT_NAME = Uzume` is untouched so the shipped `Uzume.app` is byte-identical in identity. **Four surfaces stay `phosphene`, each for a reason:** persisted `UserDefaults` keys (`phosphene.settings.*`, `phosphene.lf.recents`, `phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`, `phosphene.cache.localFile.maxBytes`) — renaming silently resets every user's settings and belongs with a `SettingsMigrator` entry, not a structural rename; on-disk output paths (`~/Documents/uzume_sessions/`, `~/uzume_features.csv`, `~/uzume_beatbench_fixtures`, `/tmp/uzume_visual`, …) — renaming orphans every captured session and invalidates every documented diagnostic command against them, and it is a **product call, not an engineering one**; `IdentityMigrator`/`SpotifyKeychainStore`'s legacy `com.phosphene.*` constants — load-bearing RN.1 migration aliases; and `.metal` comments + preset `.json` descriptions — excluded by RN.2's own "do not edit shaders or presets" constraint. **Accessibility identifiers DID move** (`phosphene.view.*` → `uzume.*`) — no persistence, no migration cost. §Rationale below. |
| D-226 | Accepted | §Rationale below. **The permission card requests capture access itself; the Settings deep link is demoted to a secondary link** (BUG111.1, 2026-08-31). Supersedes U.2's key decision that the app would never call `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` because "the system dialog doesn't compose with 'Open System Settings and return.'" **That rationale assumed macOS already listed the app** in Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording. It only lists an app once that app has requested access — so on a machine that has never granted (fresh install, `tccutil reset ScreenCapture`, or RN.1's `com.phosphene.app` → `io.uzume.mac` change, which orphaned the grant) the deep link opened an empty pane, and the only call site that would have registered the app was `startAudio()`, behind the permission gate that `ContentView` puts above the session-state switch. **A closed loop: the card was the only reachable UI and it could not lead to a grant** — the sole escape was adding the `.app` by hand with the pane's "+" button. Matt hit it live 2026-08-31 during RN.1. **Fix:** primary CTA "Allow Access" calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()` (registers the app, shows the OS dialog); "Already allowed it? Open System Settings" keeps the deep link for the already-denied case, where macOS suppresses the dialog but the app *is* listed. **Deliberately stateless** — both controls always shown, no "have we asked yet" flag to go stale, no branch to test. `SystemScreenCapturePermissionProvider` is unchanged and still never prompts: it stays the passive probe `PermissionMonitor` polls, which is what U.2's rule was actually protecting. Rejected: the original task's option (b), rewording the card to tell the user to start a session — starting a session is precisely what the gate prevents. |
| D-224 | Accepted | **Rosette retired** (WHIT-RETIRE.1, Matt's call, 2026-08-26). After the WHIT.2b ray-march conversion's jaggedness fix and the WHIT.2c orbit removal, Matt's next live look, on a fresh session: *"Ugh, it's terrible. The camera angle is weird, the design is ugly, the motion is basic. It's a loser across the board. This feels like it's going nowhere fast. Thinking we should just move to retire."* Offered a bounded, concrete two-item fix (camera recomposition so the epicycle reads as the hero rather than the wing arcs; tightness-calibration recalibration against real track data) or retirement as the alternative; Matt: *"Even a harness difference will not be enough to save this preset, I'm afraid."* Six live rounds (WHIT.0 through WHIT.2c) each landed a technically-correct fix for the specific defect raised and the overall verdict never turned positive — the D-201/D-204 pattern (a correct, working mechanism that still doesn't produce a compelling image) rather than an unfixed bug. All preset code deleted: `Rosette.metal`, `Rosette.json`, `Rosette/RosetteState.swift`, `RosetteRayMarchTests.swift`, `RosetteStateTests.swift`, `docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md`, `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/rosette/`. `expectedProductionPresetCount` 30 → 29. The `RosetteUniforms` ray-march buffer-6 ABI parameter (D-220/WHIT.2b) is also fully removed from the shared preamble and all three other ray-march presets (Volumetric Lithograph, Lumen Mosaic, Ferrofluid Ocean) — unlike `scene_orbit_speed`/`scene_dolly_speed` (a generic scalar reusable by any future preset) or `LumenPatternState`/slot 8 (a live, actively-shipping consumer), `RosetteUniforms` was a bespoke struct with zero remaining consumers; a future preset needing cross-frame CPU state can reintroduce the same pattern from git history rather than carrying dead ABI weight in the meantime (D-097 — siblings, not subclasses; "reusable infrastructure" is not a defense for a failed concept). `scene_orbit_speed` itself, and the generic `presetFragmentBuffer1`-style slot-6 mechanism, are kept per the RMENV/D-188 zero-consumer-capability precedent. Phase WHIT itself is NOT closed — `docs/presets/WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` governs three siblings (Rosette/WHIT.A built and retired; Frieze/WHIT.B and Unison/WHIT.C unstarted), and this decision retires only WHIT.A. §Rationale below. |
| D-225 | Accepted | **Phosphene renamed to Uzume, external identity only (RN.1).** Bundle ID `com.phosphene.app` → **`io.uzume.mac`** — reverse-DNS of uzume.io, which Matt is registering; `com.uzume.*`/`app.uzume.*` were rejected because uzume.com (an active taiko ensemble) and uzume.app (parked) belong to third parties, and a bundle ID should not bake in a namespace you do not own. URL scheme `uzume://`, Keychain `io.uzume.spotify`, loggers `io.uzume.*`, Application Support `Uzume/`, product `Uzume.app` with `PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME` pinned to `UzumeApp` so the Swift module rename stays in RN.2. State policy: settings and the stem cache migrate idempotently (`IdentityMigrator`); TCC grants and the Spotify token do NOT — the first is OS-keyed and impossible, the second was implemented and reverted because reading another code identity's Keychain item raises a modal prompt that blocks app launch. §Rationale below. |
| D-223 | Accepted | **Rosette's camera orbit removed — a constant-rate turntable on a wholly planar scene reads as disconnected from the music and periodically flattens the whole composition** (WHIT.2c, Matt live 2026-08-26, immediately after D-222 shipped: *"I hate it. It's just a few objects rotating 360 degrees and moving poorly with the music... I dislike the rotation and hate the way the pattern moves."*). Diagnosed from Matt's own attached session (`features.csv`) before any fix: the orbit ran at a fixed 0.12 rad/s regardless of the music, the single most visually dominant motion in the frame with zero audio coupling; and because the figure and both wing arcs all lie flat in the z=0 plane, the orbit periodically pointed the camera near edge-on to the ENTIRE scene at once — confirmed by replaying his actual session (`SessionReplayHarness`) and finding several timestamps where the whole composition flattened to a plain ring plus two thin lines even though the underlying curve was not that simple at those moments. **Decision:** `scene_orbit_speed` removed from `Rosette.json` (camera reverts to the fixed position `[1.15,1.0,-1.9]` already verified against the WHIT.2b jaggedness/perf fixes); the generic engine feature itself is kept (cheap, generic, mirrors the already-kept `scene_dolly_speed` — the failure was Rosette's unmodulated rate against a flat scene, not the mechanism). **A separate, still-open finding from the same session** (not addressed here, not yet decided by Matt): `tonal_consonance` on this track averaged 0.071 against the corpus calibration's 0.117 median / 0.32 p99, so 84% of frames sat below the point where harmony reaches even half-weight against the audio-independent floor-drift clock — a tightness-calibration question, separate from the orbit. §Rationale below. |
| D-222 | Accepted | **Rosette converted from flat 2D `direct+mv_warp` to a `ray_march` preset — genuine 3D swept-tube geometry** (WHIT.2b, Matt live 2026-08-26, same message as D-221: *"The final preset should also be 3D, not 2D, to take better advantage of the latest Apple processors."*). Wraps the UNCHANGED 2D distance-to-curve functions (`rosetteDist`/`rosetteWingDist`/`rosetteWingEllipseDist`) in a Pythagorean tube SDF (`sqrt(dist2D²+z²)-radius`) and renders through the engine's existing ray-march/PBR/IBL/SSGI pipeline — the same one Volumetric Lithograph/Lumen Mosaic/Ferrofluid Ocean already run on (D-021 `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` contract), not an invented technique. New engine-generic `scene_orbit_speed` feature (mirrors the existing dolly) makes the tube's roundness legible in motion. `RosetteUniforms` (rotation + symmetry state, D-220's carry-forward) moves from the old `direct+mv_warp` buffer to ray-march fragment buffer(6) — discovered `RayMarchPipeline`'s buffer 6/7 were completely unused, and `directPresetFragmentBuffer` was already a pipeline-agnostic Swift property, so no new engine state was needed. **Two defects found on the FIRST live look at the converted preset, both fixed in the same increment, neither a surprise given the technique change:** (1) *"fidelity is poor - lines are really jagged"* — the 2D version's coarse-then-bisect nearest-point search (BUG-104's fix) produced a distance field smooth enough for a flat, non-lit 2D fragment but not smooth enough for the ray-march G-buffer's finite-difference normals; replaced with a dense point-to-segment polyline scan (the wing arcs' own already-proven technique, adopted verbatim per FA #65/#73 rather than re-derived) — confirmed by isolating a self-crossing-free outer loop (ruling out branch-seam theory) and comparing directly against the wing tubes in the same frame. (2) A previously-invisible **150ms/frame regression** (14.8x the median preset, over `PresetFrameBudgetTests`' 60ms ceiling) — the dense search ran on every ray-march step across the ENTIRE frame, including empty background; fixed with a bounding-sphere SDF lower bound around the figure and wing tubes (mathematically exact from the curve's own `|z|<=1` identity), cut to 28ms. **Found live within that fix:** a bare `boundD > 0` cutoff is unsound — the bound is TANGENT to the true surface at specific points (the curve reaches its bounding radius exactly, for every state), so the cheap branch can return a near-zero value the march loop's hit epsilon reads as a false, audio-independent hit, silently collapsing every RosetteRayMarchTests coupling measurement toward zero; fixed with a safety margin (15x the march loop's relative hit epsilon) between the true surface and where the cheap branch is trusted. Also surfaced and fixed as part of this increment: `SessionReplayHarness` never carried the TONAL block (`tonalPhaseFifths`/`tonalConsonance`/`harmonicFlux`/`midAttRel`) for any ray-march preset — Rosette is the first to route off it — now mapped from the real CSV columns `AudioRoutePrimitives.swift` already names; and `rubric_profile` briefly (incorrectly) set to `full` mid-session — reverted to `lightweight`, since the `full` cascade (triplanar textures, volumetric fog motes, parallax occlusion) is built for painterly/terrain presets and does not conceptually apply to a spare line-art emblem. §Rationale below. |
| D-221 | Accepted | **Rosette: symmetry-order steps became a smooth multi-second transition, not an instant jump** (WHIT.2a, Matt live 2026-08-26: *"this preset MUST use motion to smoothly transition from one pattern to another, with lines separating and reattaching at different points."*). `rosetteCurve`'s formula is already continuous in `n` (no shader change needed) — `RosetteState` now interpolates `n` from the old symmetry order to the new one over `transitionDurationSeconds=4s` (smoothstep-eased) instead of writing the new integer instantly; feeding the shader a smoothly-varying `n` is itself the transition, since the curve's crossing points visibly slide, split, and re-merge as `n` moves between integers — verified by rendering the actual mid-transition frames (n=5.5 shows one lobe of the 5-fold flower visibly opening into a loose end mid-split before the 6th lobe closes). Comfortably shorter than `minHoldSeconds` (24s), so a transition always finishes well before the next one can start. Broke `test_rosette_rotationAndSymmetryCoupling`'s single-tick assumption (the old test exploited the instant-jump behavior this decision removes) — fixed by advancing two independent states to settlement before comparing, not by weakening the assertion. §Rationale below. |
| D-220 | Accepted | **Rosette: the remaining two harmony routes shipped — `RosetteState` built** (WHIT.1d-2). `morph_position`<-`tonalPhaseFifths` (a D-209 circular smoother, cos/sin EMA recombined via `atan2`, applied as a ROTATION of the figure only — wings stay fixed, D-217's frame preserved — resolving the D-219 FA #67 conflict with `figure_tightness`) and `symmetry_order_step`<-`harmonicFlux` (a 24s hold-timer stepping the epicycle's `n` through Whitney's own sequence 5→6→4 on a qualifying spike, never per-beat). New per-preset state object (`Presets/Rosette/RosetteState.swift`, Skein/Gossamer's minimal-shape pattern) wired through `VisualizerEngine`/`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (`bindRosetteRuntime`, `StatefulRuntimeRegistry.knownPresetNames`) and bound at fragment buffer(6) (`RosetteUniforms`, matching `RosetteUniformsGPU` byte-for-byte) — the first WHIT increment to touch the app-layer runtime rather than staying preset-local. All 5 declared routes now green on `RouteCoverageTests` (206 routes / 22 presets / 0 red). Found live: `MultiPassRenderHarness`'s `renderMVWarp` case only special-cased Skein's CPU state — an unbound buffer(6) collapses `rosetteDist`'s `n` to 0, which degenerates the two-term epicycle to a fixed unit circle regardless of audio input, and `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` correctly read that as a harness fault ("rendered static... the harness is not reaching its real multi-pass response") rather than silently passing; fixed by binding `RosetteState` there too. §Rationale below. |
| D-219 | Accepted | **Rosette: 3 of 5 harmony routes shipped; tonalPhaseFifths/harmonicFlux filed to WHIT.1d-2** (WHIT.1d). `figure_tightness`<-`tonalConsonance` (sqrt-calibrated against TONAL.2b's 1000-track corpus so the median lands mid-range, not linear/smoothstep — harmony SETS the sweep position, the clock demotes to a floor drift, the Nacre-round-1 lesson honoured structurally), `stroke_presence`<-`bassDev`, `morph_floor_rate`<-`midAttRel` — all stateless, all green on `RouteCoverageTests` (204 routes / 22 presets / 0 red). **`tonalPhaseFifths` (proposed as a rotation) and `harmonicFlux` (proposed as a discrete symmetry-order step) are deferred, not dropped**: both need a value held ACROSS FRAMES — a stateful circular smoother for the raw +/-pi sawtooth (D-209; the exact defect that hit Fractal Tree, "color changes feel glitchy, not intentional") and a hold-timer so a step lasts "tens of seconds" per the temporal contract — which means wiring a new per-preset state object through the shared RenderPipeline dispatch files (RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift etc.), the same infrastructure Skein/Witchlight/Nacre already carry. Rosette has none of it yet; building it is real, separate, scoped work (WHIT.1d-2), not folded silently into "add audio routes." `WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md`'s own WHIT.1d gate explicitly sanctions this ("RouteCoverageTests green on all five routes, **or a filed defect**"). Also measured: `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests.rosetteIsFlashSafe` (0.00 flashes/s, luma Δ0.004) and `FidelityRubricTests`' automated L2 gate now reads true (consonance/bassDev/midAttRel appear directly in Rosette.metal, unlike Skein/Witchlight's CPU-side-only routing). §Rationale below. |
| D-218 | Accepted | **Rosette maquette landed** (count 29 → 30; `certified:false`). John Whitney Sr.'s *Arabesque* morphing emblem, registered from the WHIT.0 look-spike (verdict GO) after WHIT.1a curated its reference set and WHIT.1b wrote its design doc. Fullscreen-triangle SDF-in-fragment marks-on-top overlay (Skein's pattern, not Dragon Bloom's raw `line_strip` as the program doc originally proposed); the numerical nearest-point stroke search was profiled at 1080p (~5.8ms p50 on an M2 Pro, well inside the 16.67ms @60fps budget) before authoring. Halation retuned against the curated reference (`06_specular_stroke_core_halo.jpg`) from WHIT.0's too-generous thumbnail estimate. **No audio coupling** (WHIT.1d); the morph runs on a clock only. `PresetAcceptanceTests` gained the same standalone-fragment-is-intentionally-black exemption Dragon Bloom/Skein/Nacre/etc. already carry (Rosette's real content is entirely in the scene-geometry overlay). Pending Matt's live M7. §Rationale below. |
| D-217 | Accepted | **Rosette: full cartouche — the mirrored coloured wing arcs + small ellipses ship as part of the frame, not as an optional extra** (WHIT.0, Matt 2026-08-25, DECISION-NEEDED #1). The look-spike rendered the same morph moment with and without the wings (`RosetteLookSpikeTests.swift`); without them the figure floats in a large dead black field, with them it reads as a composed picture — Matt's call after seeing both frames, no default assumed. Recorded alongside WHIT.0's overall GO verdict (the two-term epicycle morph reads on the real engine dispatch path; see `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase WHIT). |
| D-214 | Accepted | **Meniscus CERTIFIED — and the sync came from the audio hierarchy, not from timing accuracy** (MEN.5, Matt's M7 2026-08-05: *"Ready to certify. Looks good!!!"*). First `mesh_animation` member of the Milkdrop-inspired family and the catalog's first projected line-surface preset; count 26 -> 16 certified. **Eleven live rounds, and the first ten optimised the wrong driver.** Drop timing reached a median **6 ms** from the beat and was verified against Beat This! ground truth at +4/+8/+8/+8 ms across a track — and Matt's verdict stayed "not synced" throughout. Three causes, each measured and each invisible to the gates that existed: **(1)** the live stem path lags **5.2 s** (`2026-08-05T13-17-18Z`: drums +5.25 s r=0.550, vs r=0.363 at lag 0) and is documented in-tree as section-scale by design, so MEN.3's per-stem event routing could never work live — offline fixtures hid it by feeding stems in sync; **(2)** the surface had **no continuous audio-driven motion at all** during music (the swell was gated off as volume rose), inverting CLAUDE.md's central rule that continuous energy is the PRIMARY driver — Matt's "feels less tethered" is that rule's predicted failure, and cutting drop density made it WORSE, which is what ruled density out; **(3)** the beat drop scattered **±0.34 (68 % of the sheet)**, so it appeared somewhere different every beat — **visual sync needs an anchor to pulse in place**, and scattered impacts read as noise however perfectly timed. **Two design claims retired on evidence:** §1's "a listener can point at a ripple and say that was the snare" (§7 R3 flagged it ungrounded; eleven viewings never produced it — regions are now spatial variety keyed to bar position), and **§7 R5's jitter**, which was added because "orderly may read as mechanical" and turned out to be what destroyed the connection. **Per-note melodic routing is closed, not deferred** — MEL.1 measured guitar note events at 31 % grid coherence against a 20 % random baseline with a 41 % drums control; distortion adds harmonics rather than amplitude, so notes inside a chord wall have no attack. D-157 flash gate added at cert and measured maxΔ/frame **0.0048** against a 0.05 bar. §Rationale below. |
| D-216 | Accepted | **Stave: the stem channel comes OFF the traces and onto the field; trace marks stay purely band-driven and in-time** (CHR.2, Matt 2026-08-14, DECISION-NEEDED #1 option D). CHR.2's look spike gated the 2026-08-13 split driver (position <- EMA-centred band split ~0.3 s; colour+weight <- stem pairs ~3.0 s) and **half 1 passed, half 2 failed**. Position passed on its own terms: **median trace-to-beat offset 0 ms** on all four captures, gridline rate matching `grid_bpm` exactly (71/71, 97/98, 172/174.6). Colour failed on a measurement, not a taste call: **at the moment a mark is drawn, `r(position, colour)` = -0.15..+0.25** — the colour peaks against its own trace at **3.0 s** (post-BUG086.1; 5.4 s on the pre-fix capture the renders used), so a mark wears a colour describing a moment **38 % of an 8 s window** in its past. Compounding it, hue is a **static label assigned by frequency band**, so it is asserted even where the named stems do not exist — Clair De Lune is solo piano and its traces still read `drums+bass` / `vocals+other`, both false. **The fix is to stop pairing a fast mark with a slow channel at all.** Stems keep their place in the preset but move to a surface with no per-beat commitment (field tint / backdrop / grid luminance), where 3 s of lag is invisible; the traces carry only band-derived, in-time information. **Consequence, accepted deliberately: the preset can no longer say "this trace is the drums".** The D-121 divergence argument survives on different ground — stems still shape the image (Milkdrop has none) and the beat grid is still structurally un-fakeable — but per-mark instrument identity is out of scope, and the concept sentence changes from four/two *instrument* voices to **low against high, ruled by the beat, in a room the stems tint.** Rejected: **A** (drop stems entirely) discards a real capability for free; **B** (weight/texture instead of hue) changes the medium, not the lag, so it does not touch the defect; **C** (stem-driven position) was weighed and rejected 2026-08-13 and CHR.2 only strengthens the case against — the cost of the split is now measured rather than assumed. **Also retired at CHR.2, both from CHR.1:** the **"converge and diverge"** reading (its divergence ratio 0.75-vs-1.45-null is dominated by the rhythm/melodic **amplitude mismatch**, std ratio **4.4-17.5x**, and collapses onto `sqrt(2(1-r))` once both traces are drawn at visible scale — what survives is near-independence, r -0.27..+0.27 on 13 of 15, which is the property the concept actually wants); and CHR.1 §4's **common-mode table, whose track labels are shifted** — re-measured, worst is **Bohemian Rhapsody 93.4 %** / Superstition 93.1 %, and **Take Five 82.9 % is among the easiest**, so §5's "jazz is the worst case" is false. **Bleed remains an unfixed miss** (r +0.695): its two traces collapse into one flat band, which is what the material does, not something tuning reaches. Preset count unchanged at 28; CHR.3 authors. §Rationale below. |
| D-215 | Accepted | **Phase MD reconciled to practice — taxonomy, layout, source form and candidate list; Milkdrop Settings toggle deleted; D-115 resolved to C'** (MD.0, 2026-08-07). `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` has five commits, all 2026-05-12, and none since; seven Milkdrop-inspired presets shipped and certified between then and now (Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana, Floret, Glaze, Nacre, Meniscus, Witchlight), every one authored by a process the strategy doc does not describe, producing sidecars its schema would reject. **Four supersessions written back** as `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §13: **(1) taxonomy** — no `family: "milkdrop_inspired"` and no `.milkdropInspired` enum case (**D-123**, 2026-05-13); uplifts file into the 11-case cream-of-crop `PresetCategory` (measured: `hypnotic` ×6, `particles` ×1), and the `inspired_by` sidecar block — documentation-only, no `PresetDescriptor` coding key, ignored by `Codable` — is the only marker of origin; **(2) layout** — `Shaders/Milkdrop/<theme>_<source_name>` was never adopted; all 28 sidecars are flat in `Shaders/`, named for the Uzume preset, and a source-named file contradicts D-113 besides; **(3) source form** — the operative corpus is the **butterchurn built-in set rendered through `tools/milkdrop-render/`**, not `.milk` (the runtime `.milk` converter renders directory presets poorly, so the gallery Matt picks from is built from built-ins); 6 of 7 uplifts read a butterchurn JSON, only Dragon Bloom read a `.milk` (removed at PUB.1); `sha256` is the hash of the artifact **actually read** and `source_form` names what that was — both normalised across all seven sidecars at MD.0; **(4) candidate list** — `docs/presets/MILKDROP_UPLIFT_PICKS.md` (2026-06-01) is operative; D-112's nine named `.milk` candidates are historical and **none was used**. Plus: **MD.1 retired** (its consumer does not exist — no author opens a `.milk`); **D-120 residue stripped** from `Meniscus.json` + `CymaticResonance.json` — and it is a **recurrence, not a leftover**: the CA.4 audit's 2026-05-20 grep was correct, and both sidecars were created *after* it (CR.1 2026-07-22, MEN.2a 2026-08-03) by authors following design docs that still prescribe the reverted fields; those docs are corrected here, but the durable fix is unknown-key rejection at decode, not built at MD.0. **Measured catalog state:** 28 sidecars − 2 diagnostics = **26 production, 18 certified, 7 inspired-by (all certified)** = **27 % of roster / 39 % of certified**, against D-119's ≥ 50 % — **D-122 trigger 4 fires on the letter**; MD.0 does not halt Phase MD and routes the reading to Matt with D-115 (both open). Also recorded: the failure mode D-122 trigger 3 watches for (over-fidelity) has **never been observed** — Witchlight's 2026-08-03 M7 rejected it for being too *unlike* the source. **Matt's two calls, same day:** (a) **delete the Milkdrop Settings toggle** (DECISION-NEEDED #1, option A) — the QR.4 / D-091 "Coming in a future update" stub, its store property, key, view-model flag, view row, two strings and three tests are removed (app tests 407 → 404); shipping it was impossible to wire honestly through `family`, since `hypnotic` + `particles` also hold **seven Uzume-native presets** (Aurora Veil, Plasma, Filigree, Mitosis, Cytokinesis, Murmuration, Nebula — five certified), and a per-preset check needs `inspired_by` decoding that does not exist; (b) **D-115 resolved to C' (10 + 10)** after twelve weeks open — **three more uplifts to the D-114 threshold** against six under the superseded A' (7+13), making D-119's ≥ 50 % a **steady-state target rather than a first-release gate**, which in turn resolves **D-122 trigger 4** to `proceed` (the 27 % share is a pre-composition transient, not drift). **§12 is not rewritten in place**; §13 supersedes it on the same terms §12 supersedes §§1–11. §Rationale below. |
| D-198 | Accepted | Cymatic Resonance CR.1.2 — second-M7 fixes (Matt M7 2026-07-22 "Cherub Rock", clean chain). **(1) Framing:** the oblique tilt left a receding-background triangle at the top; switched to a **top-down orthographic cover-fit** — the square plate fills the 16:9 frame edge-to-edge, no background (Matt: "camera directly above would be better"). **(2) "Only 3 patterns, boring":** widened the ladder traversal (centroid-dev gain 8→12) AND replaced the uniform `(m,m+2)` ladder with a **varied same-parity** set (alternating `m=n` concentric grids with `m<n` cross-hatch) so adjacent rungs are visibly distinct figures. **(3) "Colour doesn't change":** brought CR.3's hue routing forward — a global jewel-palette hue offset driven by the **smoothed harmonic phase** (`tonal_phase_fifths`, D-178; range 6.25 on the track — fully alive), circular-smoothed via sin/cos. Snap depth 0.9→0.65 (top-down, lowest modes read empty). Golden regenerated. Pending Matt's next live M7. §Rationale below. |
| D-197 | Accepted | Cymatic Resonance CR.1.1 — live-M7 defect fixes (Matt M7 2026-07-22, "Hummer"). **(1) Hero "held its pattern":** real `spectral_centroid` occupies ~0.08–0.18 on music (verified on the session's healthy portion: p5 0.085 / p95 0.162), so the old `centroid × (N-1)` mapping moved the ladder < 1 of 11 rungs (the Nimbus/BUG-027 AGC-calibration trap). Fixed with a **BLEND** (Matt's call): mostly a per-track centroid DEVIATION (guarantees visible travel on any track) + a gentle absolute tilt (brighter ⇒ finer). Regression-locked: the real narrow band now traverses 3.75 rungs (was < 1). **(2) Palette read white:** emissive 2.6 → 1.5 (ridges sit near the bloom threshold so colour survives ACES), white key → warm-gold, hue sweep widened to sapphire→magenta→gold. **(3) White space:** plate zoomed (camDist 2.75→1.85, plateHalf 1.0→1.18, elev 52→48) to fill the 16:9 canvas. **(4) ASH `.critical` nudge gap (folded in):** `PlaybackErrorBridge` fired the low-levels nudge only on `peakBand == .low`; `.critical` (worse) fired nothing, so the degraded-chain M7 ran unflagged — now both bands nudge. Golden regenerated. Pending a clean-chain live re-M7. §Rationale below. |
| D-196 | Accepted | Cymatic Resonance CR.1 maquette landed (count 25 → 26; `certified:false`). First `direct`+`post_process` preset — a resonant-plate Chladni nodal figure selected live by spectral centroid (mode-complexity ladder), `bassDev` snap-to-simple, derived-normal relief + GGX + jewel emissive on deep black, strong oblique tilt, through ACES + bloom. **Engine:** slot-6 per-preset state now reaches the `direct`+`post_process` scene pass (`PostProcessChain.runScenePass` threads `presetFragmentBuffer` at fragment index 6 — zero-risk, that path had no production consumer before CR). **★ Concept-gate correction #5 (found at the maquette):** the plus basis forces an anti-diagonal nodal line for OPPOSITE-parity (m,n), so the design's adjacent-pair ladder carried the forbidden diagonal (incl. the fundamental); fixed by the SAME-parity `(m,m+2)` family `(1,3)…(11,13)`. Perf 1080p full-chain p95 ≈ 1–2.6 ms. Pending Matt's live M7. §Rationale below. |
| D-195 | Accepted | Motion review gate (`Scripts/motion_gate.sh`) — the temporal counterpart to the D-181 still sheet. The still harness only rendered 3 disconnected frames, so jitter/pop/strobe/freeze were invisible until live M7 (the exact Truchet miss, D-194). The gate turns a preset's MOTION into a frame-to-frame magnitude signal (spike count = jitter, ~0 = freeze) + sampled frames the reader views as a sequence + a pointer to `target_animated.gif`. Reader-is-the-eyes (D-064): spike count is evidence, not an auto-pass. Deps ffmpeg+python3 only. Mandated in `PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 1 step 7 (pre-M7); closeout evidence for preset increments. Sequence feed reuses `renderFrame` in `PresetVisualReviewTests`. §Rationale below. |
| D-194 | Accepted | Truchet Loom RETIRED (TLRETIRE.1) — first live M7 (2026-07-21) rejected it fundamentally: the square Truchet lattice + discrete per-beat flips read as a visible grid that jitters ("looks like a bug"), it matched none of the curated flowing-scallop references (hero `01_macro_labyrinth_floor.jpg`), and it never delivered "psychedelic geometry" ("I don't understand what this is or why this is psychedelic geometry"). The design doc's mechanic (blocky Truchet tiling, ported from IQ/Carlson) and its curated references (flowing fine-line scallop op-art) were two different aesthetics — the concept was scrapped, not tuned. Built PG.4.1–4.3 (D-189/190/191) all deleted: preset `.metal`/`.json`, `TruchetLoom{Density,RhythmColour}Tests`, `truchet_loom/` refs, `PG_4_TRUCHET_LOOM.md` design doc, and the `SpectralHistoryBuffer` `flux_smoothed`/`beat_index` reserved slots (built for it, no other consumer). Count 26 → 25. ★ Lesson: reference images are the source of truth for the LOOK; validate that a "port algorithm X" instruction actually produces the reference look BEFORE building; stills lied about the living result. Second PG-phase preset to die at M7 on a fidelity/concept miss (after Kinetic Sculpture / D-188). |

## D-002: Core Audio taps as default capture path

**Status:** Accepted

Default capture uses `AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap` (macOS 14.2+). ScreenCaptureKit was explored and abandoned.

**Reason:** ScreenCaptureKit (`SCStream` with `capturesAudio = true`) delivers video frames but zero audio callbacks on macOS 15+. Root cause unknown. Core Audio taps work reliably and are purpose-built for audio tapping.

**Note:** The capture architecture remains provider-oriented (`AudioInputRouter` abstracts `.systemAudio`, `.application`, `.localFile`). The provider model is preserved for future fallback paths and testability.

---

## D-009: No CoreML dependency (MPSGraph + Accelerate)

**Status:** Accepted (replaced D-008a: CoreML for ML inference)

All ML inference uses MPSGraph (GPU, Float32) for stem separation and Accelerate/vDSP for mood classification. The CoreML framework was removed entirely in Phase 3.7.

**Reason:** CoreML's ANE path outputs Float16 requiring ~420ms conversion overhead. MPSGraph runs Float32 throughout, eliminates the conversion bottleneck, and achieves 142ms warm predict (4.4× faster than CoreML's ~620ms). CoreML also could not convert HTDemucs or Open-Unmix's full pipeline due to complex tensor ops.

---

## D-014: Orchestrator as explicit scoring/policy system

**Status:** Proposed

The Orchestrator will be a scored decision model with explicit inputs (energy trajectory, section confidence, stem salience, visual fatigue, preset novelty, transition compatibility, performance cost) and testable golden-session fixtures.

**Reason:** The Orchestrator is the product's key differentiator. It cannot remain a black box or a stub. Explicit policy with curated test fixtures is the only way to catch regressions in show quality.

---

## D-019: Stem routing warmup fallback pattern for compute presets

**Status:** Accepted

Compute kernels that route `StemFeatures` to visual parameters must handle the ~10s warmup window before live stems are available. The accepted pattern: detect zero stems via `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` and mix between FeatureVector 6-band fallback values and true stem values. When total stem energy is below the lower threshold, pure FeatureVector routing applies (identical behavior to the pre-stem implementation). When above the upper threshold, full stem routing applies.

**Reason:** In ad-hoc mode and at the start of each track in session mode, `StemFeatures` is `.zero` for up to 10–15 seconds. A kernel that reads zero stems without fallback produces flat, unresponsive visuals during this window. The smoothstep crossfade makes the transition invisible — the kernel degrades gracefully to full-mix frequency analysis rather than going dark.

**Implication for new particle/compute presets:** Any preset that uses `buffer(3)` for stem routing should implement this pattern or an equivalent. The crossfade range (0.02–0.06) is intentionally narrow so the transition completes within the first few update cycles once stems arrive.

---

## D-018: SessionManager degrades to ready on any preparation failure

**Status:** Accepted

If `PlaylistConnector.connect()` throws, `SessionManager` transitions to `ready` with an empty plan. If `SessionPreparer.prepare()` completes with some failed tracks, `SessionManager` transitions to `ready` with a partial plan. The manager never becomes stuck in `connecting` or `preparing`.

**Reason:** Metadata degradation principle: Uzume must be functional at every tier. An empty or partial session plan means the engine runs in reactive mode for uncached tracks — a worse experience than a full session, but a valid one. Surfacing a hard failure from the session lifecycle would force the UI to handle an error state that has no natural recovery path short of starting over.

**Implication for tests:** Tests that verify degradation behavior must cover both failure modes (connector failure → empty plan, resolver failure → partial plan) independently.

---

## D-020: Architecture-stays-solid for ray-march scene presets (Glass Brutalist Option A)

**Status:** Accepted — but its subject preset (Glass Brutalist) was **retired GBRETIRE.1 / D-186** (2026-07-19). The rule itself still governs any *future* architectural ray-march preset; the D-020 permanence constraint is precisely what made Glass Brutalist non-viable (an audio-static scene can never make an instrument the hero subject). See D-186.

For ray-march scenes that depict identifiable architecture (corridors, rooms, structures with implied permanence), audio reactivity must NOT deform the architecture itself. Walls, pillars, beams, floors, and ceilings stay static. Music drives only the *light* in the scene (intensity, colour), the *atmosphere* (fog density), the *camera* (constant-speed dolly), and at most a single secondary deformation that reads as spatial rather than structural (Glass Brutalist's glass-fin position, which widens/narrows the open path between fins).

**Reason:** Three iterations of bass-driven beam dipping, pillar squeezing, and fin Y-stretching all produced the same complaint: the scene reads as broken or rubber. Architecture has implied permanence; visibly warping a concrete cross-beam on every kick drum collapses the spatial illusion. Real-world music reactivity in spaces (clubs, cathedrals, light shows) modulates lighting and mist, never the building. Uzume's deferred PBR pipeline already gives us the mechanism — modulate `lightColor`, `lightIntensity`, `fogFar`, and IBL ambient, leave geometry alone.

**Implication for ray-march preset authors:** `sceneSDF` should be audio-independent or limited to a single, intentionally subtle non-architectural element. Modulation of lighting/atmosphere happens in the shared Swift render path (`drawWithRayMarch`) reading from `RayMarchPipeline.BaseSceneSnapshot` so per-frame modulation is additive on the JSON baseline. If a preset needs SDF-side modulation that material classification must agree with (e.g. Glass Brutalist's fin X-position), pass it via a free `SceneUniforms` lane that both `sceneSDF` and `sceneMaterial` read from — never re-evaluate sub-SDFs at a different shape in `sceneMaterial` than in `sceneSDF`, or material boundaries will flip at deformed edges.

---

## D-022: IBL ambient is tinted by `lightColor` so mood shifts are visible

**Status:** Accepted

`raymarch_lighting_fragment` multiplies its computed IBL ambient term by `scene.lightColor.rgb` before adding it to direct light. The same tint is applied to fog colour.

**Reason:** Indoor ray-march scenes are dominated by IBL ambient — the direct scene light only catches surfaces facing it (often a small fraction of the visible frame). Modulating only the direct light's `lightColor` (e.g. by `valence`) leaves most of the rendered pixels colour-unchanged. Multiplying the ambient by `lightColor.rgb` makes the mood-driven palette shift visible across every concrete surface, not just light-facing ones. At rest `lightColor ≈ (1, 0.95, 0.88)` so the multiply is near-identity; under modulation it propagates through the whole scene.

---

## D-026: Preset shaders drive from audio deviation, not absolute energy

**Status:** Accepted (Phase MV-1)

Preset shader code must drive visual parameters from deviation-from-AGC-center (`f.bassRel`, `f.bassDev`, `stems.vocalsEnergyDev`, etc.) rather than from absolute energy values (`f.bass`, `f.bassAtt`, `stems.vocalsEnergy`). Absolute thresholds like `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` are explicitly disallowed in new preset code.

**Reason:** `BandEnergyProcessor` implements Milkdrop-style AGC: output = raw / runningAverage × 0.5. This inherently means raw output magnitudes depend on recent loudness history, not acoustic loudness. A kick that peaks at `bass = 0.35` during a sparse section will peak at `bass = 0.22` during a busy section because the running-average divisor rose — the kick is equally loud acoustically but AGC scaled it down. Preset v3.3 of Volumetric Lithograph hit this exact failure mode: `smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass)` missed every other kick on Love Rehab (session 2026-04-16T18-56-59Z), producing a phantom 65 BPM rhythm on a 125 BPM track. Deviation (`bass - 0.5`, or `bassRel` in the new convention) is stable across mix density because both numerator and denominator track together.

Milkdrop documents this convention in its preset authoring guide: "1 is normal, below 0.7 quiet, above 1.3 loud" — authors universally write `zoom = zoom + 0.1 * (bass - 1.0)`, never `if (bass > 0.22)`. We adopt the same convention scaled to our 0.5-centered AGC.

**Implication:** existing presets written with absolute thresholds are grandfathered but should be migrated. New preset code review must reject absolute-threshold patterns. CLAUDE.md's "Proven Audio Analysis Tuning" section documents the primitive vocabulary authors should use.

---

## D-027: Milkdrop-style per-vertex feedback warp as an opt-in render pass

**Status:** Accepted (Phase MV-2)

A new `mv_warp` render pass implements Milkdrop's per-vertex warp mesh — 32×24 grid, per-vertex UV displacement computed from preset-authored `mvWarpPerFrame()` + `mvWarpPerVertex()` functions, sampled against a persistent feedback texture. Any preset can opt in by adding `"mv_warp"` to its `passes` array.

**Reason:** Research documented in [MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md](MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE.md) established that Milkdrop's "musical feel" comes from feedback-based motion accumulation, not from rich audio analysis (Milkdrop's audio vocabulary is a strict subset of ours). 9 of 11 Uzume presets prior to MV-2 do not use any feedback loop; ray-march presets render from scratch each frame and show only instantaneous audio state. Six iterations of Volumetric Lithograph (v3 → v4.2) attempted to make a ray-march preset feel musical via increasingly elaborate audio drivers and failed every time. The gap is mechanical: without feedback, simple audio cannot compound into organic motion.

The existing `feedback` pass is kept for Starburst/Membrane but is semantically narrower (single global zoom+rot per frame, not per-vertex spatial modulation). `mv_warp` is a new pass with a different contract, not a replacement.

**Authoring approach:** MV-2a (per-preset Metal warp functions, same pattern as `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial`). Faster to ship than an equation-language parser (MV-2b). An equation-language importer for real Milkdrop `.milk` presets is tracked as a potential future increment only if Metal-function authoring becomes the demonstrated blocker.

**Implication:** ray-march preset authoring pattern shifts. A scene's 3D geometry becomes static (not deformed with audio); all audio-driven motion goes through the mv_warp pass. Audio reacts to the *image* of the scene rather than its geometry. This matches Milkdrop's architecture exactly and preserves our 3D-rendering advantage.

**Scope correction (2026-04-17, see D-029):** The "ray-march preset authoring pattern shifts" framing above was over-broad. mv_warp is one of several *alternative* motion-source paradigms, not a universal requirement for ray-march presets. It does not compose with a moving world-space camera (see D-029 for the incompatibility diagnosis and the VL revert).

**Implementation notes (landed 2026-04-17, commit `c8cd558f`):**
- `MVWarpState` uses `@unchecked Sendable` because `MTLTexture` protocol has no `Sendable` conformance in Swift 6.0. The struct is only mutated under `mvWarpLock`.
- `SceneUniforms` is defined in `mvWarpPreamble` behind `#ifndef SCENE_UNIFORMS_DEFINED` so direct (non-ray-march) presets compile; the ray-march preamble wraps its own definition in the same guard to prevent redefinition for ray-march + mv_warp combos.
- `mvWarpPerFrame()` + `mvWarpPerVertex()` must be implemented in every preset that includes `mv_warp` in its passes — the engine does not provide a default (see `Shaders/MVWarp.metal` for the engine-library default implementations that `PresetLoader` falls back to via the default engine library).
- Ray-march + mv_warp handoff: `drawWithRayMarch` detects `.mvWarp` in `activePasses` and renders to `warpState.sceneTexture` instead of the drawable; `drawWithMVWarp` is called next and handles drawable presentation. `sceneAlreadyRendered: true` is passed in this case.

---

## D-029: Preset motion sources are alternative paradigms, not composable layers

> **⚠ RE-EVALUATE (audit 2026-05-13).** Recent staged-composition work (Arachne V.7.7B — WORLD + COMPOSITE stages) and the open multi-preset-per-song planner direction may strain the "paradigms are alternatives, not composable layers" framing. Staged composition explicitly composes ray-march WORLD + COMPOSITE fragment overlay; multi-preset-per-song planning is the bigger unfinished product axis (per memory note `feedback_multi_preset_per_song.md`). Schedule a re-evaluation session when the multi-preset planner spec lands.

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-17)

Each preset picks exactly one motion-source paradigm from the following catalogue. The engine supports all of them via the `passes` array, but mixing them within a single preset is either incoherent or actively broken.

| Paradigm | Motion comes from | Example presets | Passes |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Milkdrop mv_warp** | Per-vertex UV feedback accumulator — "the warp mesh is the camera" | *(future direct-fragment presets; optionally static-camera ray march)* | `mv_warp` (± `direct` / `ray_march` without camera motion) |
| **Particle system** | Compute-kernel sprite integration in world space | Starburst (Murmuration) | `feedback` + `particles` |
| **Feedback composite** | Single global zoom/rotation per frame + persistent texture | Membrane | `feedback` |
| **Ray-march camera flight** | Translating/rotating a 3D camera through an SDF scene; motion compounds via spatial traversal | VolumetricLithograph, KineticSculpture, GlassBrutalist (static variant) | `ray_march` + `post_process` (+ `ssgi`) |
| **Mesh shader animation** | GPU-authored procedural geometry evolution | FractalTree | `mesh_shader` |
| **Direct-fragment modulation** | Time + audio into a single fragment shader; no persistence | Waveform, Plasma, Nebula | `direct` |

**Reason:** The MV-2 rollout (D-027) attempted to add mv_warp on top of VolumetricLithograph's forward camera dolly. The result was severe vertical smearing at rest: mv_warp's feedback accumulator pins previous-frame pixels to UV coordinates, but the moving world-space camera re-projects those same world points to different UV coordinates each frame, so `0.96 × previous + 0.04 × current` bleeds camera-motion history across the screen. See CLAUDE.md Failed Approaches #32.

The same bug applies — more subtly — to any ray-march preset that translates or rotates its camera. It applies partially to particle systems (particles already integrate state, so stacking mv_warp over them double-integrates and smears trails into mush).

**Rule:** Paradigms may not be stacked. The only legitimate compositions are:
- `mv_warp` + static-camera `ray_march` — a 3D SDF backdrop receives Milkdrop-style 2D warp on top. Narrow use case; none implemented as of 2026-04-17.
- `ray_march` + `post_process` + `ssgi` — standard ray-march compositing (not a motion-source mix).
- `feedback` + `particles` — Starburst's original and current pattern; feedback here is a trail decay for the particle render, not an independent motion source.

**Implication for PresetLoader:** the current mutual-exclusion routing in `compileShader()` (meshShader → mvWarp → rayMarch → standard) enforces the rule by construction and should be kept. A future static-camera `ray_march + mv_warp` preset remains supported by the existing `compileMVWarpShader` branch (it already handles the ray-march variant).

**Implication for preset authors:** do not reach for `mv_warp` as a universal "add musicality" switch. Ask first what the preset's motion source is. If it's a moving camera or a particle system, mv_warp will fight it. If it's a static 2D or static-camera 3D scene with no inherent compounding, mv_warp is one valid choice (feedback and mesh-shader animation are others).

**Reverts and documentation changes:**
- Starburst.json: `["mv_warp"]` → `["feedback", "particles"]`. Stale `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` removed.
- VolumetricLithograph.json: `["ray_march", "post_process", "mv_warp"]` → `["ray_march", "post_process"]`. `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` and the unused `vl_pitchHueShift` helper removed.
- CLAUDE.md Failed Approaches #32 rewritten to describe the camera/feedback incompatibility rather than the old "ray march needs feedback" claim.
- CLAUDE.md "Do not" rule reframed from "always implement mv_warp" to "do not stack mv_warp on a moving camera."
- D-027 scope-corrected with a forward pointer to this entry.

## D-030: SpectralHistoryBuffer as unconditional GPU contract at buffer(5)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-19)

A pre-allocated `.storageModeShared` MTLBuffer (16 KB, 4096 Float32) carrying per-frame MIR history is bound unconditionally at fragment buffer index 5 in all direct-pass encoders (`drawDirect`, `drawParticleMode`, `drawSurfaceMode`). The class is `SpectralHistoryBuffer` in the Shared module; it conforms to `SpectralHistoryPublishing` for test injection.

**Layout:**
```
[0..479]    valence trail         (-1..1, raw)
[480..959]  arousal trail         (-1..1, raw)
[960..1439] beat_phase01 history  (0..1, sawtooth)
[1440..1919] bass_dev history     (0..1)
[1920..2399] vocals_pitch_norm    (0..1, log2(hz/80)/log2(10), 0=unvoiced/low confidence)
[2400]      write_head            (integer as Float, 0..479)
[2401]      samples_valid         (integer as Float, capped at 480)
[2402..4095] reserved             (zeroed; future consumers)
```

**Why:** Uzume's MV-3 extensions (D-028) added ~26 new per-frame primitives with no real-time observability. `SessionRecorder` (D-025) captures them offline to CSV but there's no live view during preset authoring. An always-bound history ring at buffer(5) lets `instrument`-family presets render recent MIR state trivially and creates the foundation for any future preset that wants short-term history without new plumbing. 16 KB on UMA is negligible.

**Why buffer(5) and not buffer(4):** buffer(4) is already occupied by `SceneUniforms` in ray march G-buffer, lighting, and SSGI passes. Buffer(5) is the first truly unused slot across all pass types. CLAUDE.md GPU Contract documentation was wrong (listed buffer(0)=FFT, buffer(4–7)=future) — corrected in this increment.

**First consumer:** `SpectralCartograph` preset — four-panel diagnostic instrument showing FFT spectrum, deviation meters, V/A plot, and scrolling feature graphs.

**Implication:** future additions to the history layout (e.g., per-stem onset rate history) can consume slots [2402..4095] without breaking existing consumers. Ray march presets currently skip buffer(5); it is available to them if needed.

## D-032: Preset scoring weights and penalty structure (Increment 4.1)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-20). **Amended 2026-05-06 by D-080 rule 5** — `cutEnergyThreshold` raised from 0.7 → 0.85 (reserves hard cuts for true climax moments only); see D-080 for the QR.2 rationale. The four sub-score weights, the multiplicative-penalty structure, and the fatigue cooldowns (60 / 120 / 300 s) remain unchanged.

`DefaultPresetScorer` combines four sub-scores into a final [0, 1] total using fixed weights and two multiplicative penalties.

**Sub-score weights:** `mood = 0.30`, `tempoMotion = 0.20`, `stemAffinity = 0.25`, `sectionSuitability = 0.25`. Sum = 1.0, so `raw` is already in [0, 1] without normalisation — any sub-score is directly readable as a fraction of the total budget.

**Why mood gets the highest weight (0.30):** Mood is the single axis with the most perceptual surface area. A wrong emotional tone undermines the entire visual experience even when tempo and stem affinity are well-matched. Valence → colour temperature and arousal → visual density are the two most directly observable mismatches; together they justify the extra 5 points over the other dimensions.

**Why tempoMotion gets the lowest weight (0.20):** BPM metadata is often missing (nil in `TrackProfile`) and the scorer maps nil to neutral 0.5 to avoid penalising presets on missing data. A nil-safe neutral degrades information, so this dimension earns less influence. When BPM is available it is valuable; when absent, the other three dimensions carry the decision.

**Why stemAffinity and sectionSuitability share 0.25 each:** Both are equally important for the product's stated purpose (intentional visual sequencing). Stem affinity makes the preset feel musically responsive; section suitability makes timing feel deliberate. Equal weighting avoids one outweighing the other given the uncertainty in both.

**Multiplicative penalties:** `familyRepeatMultiplier` (0.2× for consecutive same-family) and `fatigueMultiplier` (smoothstep over 60/120/300s cooldown) are multiplicative, not additive, so they compose cleanly. A 0.2× family-repeat penalty on a 0.9 raw score gives 0.18, not 0.7 (which additive would). This ensures highly-penalised presets lose to even mediocre competitors — the intended behaviour.

**Exclusions are separate from penalties:** `excluded = true` always produces `total = 0` and populates `exclusionReason`. This keeps "why is this at zero" answerable from the breakdown: "excluded for cost" vs "penalised to near-zero by fatigue and repeat" are different problems with different remedies.

**Fatigue cooldown windows:** `.low = 60s`, `.medium = 120s`, `.high = 300s`. These are the smallest values that created observable variety in internal playlist test sessions without causing visually jarring avoidance patterns (every session felt different, no preset disappeared for so long that its return felt jarring). `smoothstep` rather than a linear ramp avoids an abrupt "fully available" cliff.

**How to apply:** The `internal static let` constants (`weightMood`, `weightTempoMotion`, `weightStemAffinity`, `weightSectionSuitability`, `familyRepeatPenalty`, `fatigueCooldown`) are the only place these values are defined — adjust there to tune globally. The `PresetScoreBreakdown` struct surfaces all sub-scores for introspection and future calibration tooling.

**Scarcity-via-cooldown pattern (Stalker, Increment 3.5.7):** `fatigue_risk: "high"` is the correct lever to make a preset feel rare and surprising without adding per-preset logic. Stalker's 300 s cooldown means it appears at most once per 5 minutes in a continuous session, which is intentional — a predator that appears too often stops feeling predatory. The listening-pose capability justifies scarcity: it needs time between appearances to retain its perceptual impact.

## D-033: Transition policy design — structural boundary priority and energy-scaled crossfades (Increment 4.2)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-20)

`DefaultTransitionPolicy` answers the "when + how" question. Two trigger paths, strict priority order.

**Structural boundary (preferred):** Fires when `StructuralPrediction.confidence ≥ 0.5` and the predicted next boundary is within 2.5 s (the `LookaheadBuffer` window). `scheduledAt` is offset before the boundary so a crossfade or morph completes exactly at it; a cut is scheduled at the boundary itself. Confidence threshold 0.5 was chosen as the midpoint of the [0, 1] range — the analyzer produces values above this for tracks with detectable periodic structure (ABAB or verse/chorus patterns), and values below for ambient or through-composed material.

**Duration-expired fallback:** Fires when `elapsedPresetTime ≥ preset.duration`. `scheduledAt = captureTime` (transition now). Confidence reports 1.0 because the trigger is deterministic, not a probabilistic prediction.

**Why structural boundary beats the timer:** Section boundaries are the musically correct moment to switch visuals. The timer fires regardless of where we are in the track structure. When both conditions are true simultaneously (preset is overdue AND a boundary is imminent), the structural path produces a less jarring result — it aligns with what the listener hears.

**Style selection:** The current preset's `transitionAffordances` constrain the palette. Within that palette, energy drives preference: above `cutEnergyThreshold = 0.7` the policy prefers `.cut` (fast, punchy — appropriate at peaks), below it prefers `.crossfade` (slow blend — appropriate for relaxed passages). Default fallback when no affordances are declared: `.crossfade`.

**Crossfade duration scaling:** Linear interpolation between `baseCrossfadeDuration = 2.0s` (energy=0) and `minCrossfadeDuration = 0.5s` (energy=1). This gives the visually desired behaviour — slow, deliberate fades during quiet passages; quick, energetic ones during peaks.

**Family-repeat avoidance is NOT in TransitionPolicy:** The `DefaultPresetScorer` already applies a 0.2× family-repeat penalty during ranking (D-032). TransitionPolicy receives a ranked list and picks from the top — no duplicate logic needed.

**`TransitionDecision` is a pure value type:** trigger, scheduledAt, style, duration, confidence, rationale. No callbacks, no side effects. Callers schedule the transition externally from the returned struct.

**How to apply:** Tune the four `static let` constants in `DefaultTransitionPolicy` (`structuralConfidenceThreshold`, `lookaheadWindow`, `baseCrossfadeDuration`, `minCrossfadeDuration`, `cutEnergyThreshold`) to adjust timing behaviour globally. The `TransitionDeciding` protocol allows injection of test doubles or alternative implementations without changing callers.

## D-044 — SwiftUI accessibility identifiers: static constants + binding, not tree traversal (Increment U.1)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-22)

**Context:** Increment U.1 required tests that verify each session-state view carries the correct `accessibilityIdentifier` — needed for UI automation (XCUITest, Accessibility Inspector). The first implementation used `NSHostingController` + `NSWindow` rendering + `accessibilityChildren()` traversal via ObjC dynamic dispatch (`NSSelectorFromString`). All 6 rendering-based tests failed.

**Root cause:** On macOS, SwiftUI only materialises the accessibility tree when an active accessibility client queries it (VoiceOver, Accessibility Inspector, XCUITest harness). In `xcodebuild test` unit tests there is no client — `NSHostingView.accessibilityChildren()` returns an empty array regardless of RunLoop cycles, window visibility, or ObjC dispatch approach. This is a platform behaviour, not a SwiftLint or concurrency issue.

**Decision:** Each view exposes `static let accessibilityID: String`. The view body applies `.accessibilityIdentifier(Self.accessibilityID)`. Unit tests check the static constant directly; the binding is enforced by construction (if the modifier is removed, UI automation breaks — caught by human review or XCUITest, not unit tests).

**Rule:** Do not attempt accessibility tree traversal from `xcodebuild test` unit tests. Use static constants for identifier contracts. Accessibility tree verification belongs in XCUITest (future Milestone A acceptance suite), not unit tests.


## D-045 — V.1 utility library naming: unprefixed snake_case, no legacy collision renaming (Increment V.1)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-22)

**Context:** Increment V.1 adds two utility trees — 9 Noise files and 9 PBR files — into `Sources/Presets/Shaders/Utilities/`. The legacy `ShaderUtilities.metal` already contains functions such as `perlin2D`, `cookTorranceBRDF`, `fresnelSchlick` (camelCase convention). The new utilities use `perlin2d`, `brdf_ggx`, `fresnel_schlick` (snake_case convention). The question was whether to rename existing functions to `legacy_*`, prefix new ones, or leave both coexisting.

**Pre-flight finding:** MSL is case-sensitive. `perlin2d` vs `perlin2D` are distinct symbols. A complete audit of all 9 Noise and 9 PBR new function names found zero name-space collisions with any existing `ShaderUtilities.metal` function. No renaming was required.

**Decision:** New V.1 utilities use clean snake_case names with no prefix. Legacy ShaderUtilities functions are unchanged. Both coexist in the preamble without collision. Future V.3+ authoring vocabulary will use the V.1 snake_case names as the primary interface; legacy camelCase names remain available for backward compatibility with existing preset code.

**Rule:** When adding new preamble functions, use snake_case to distinguish from the legacy camelCase ShaderUtilities layer. Only apply `legacy_*` prefix if a true case-insensitive collision exists (none found in V.1). Do not rename existing working functions — preset shaders referencing them would break.

## D-051 — UserFacingError in engine Shared module; condition-ID toast semantics (Increment U.7)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-24)

**Context:** U.7 introduces a typed error taxonomy (`UserFacingError`, 29 cases) and a condition-ID mechanism for idempotent, auto-dismissing toasts. Two placement questions arose.

**Decision 1 — UserFacingError in engine `Shared` module (not `UzumeApp`).**
`UserFacingError` maps internal states (silence, network loss, rate limiting, DRM, etc.) to presentation metadata (`severity`, `presentationMode`, `conditionID`). These states originate in engine modules (`Audio`, `Session`, `Orchestrator`). Placing the enum in `Shared` lets engine code reference it without creating an upward dependency on the app layer. `Localizable.strings` and `LocalizedCopy` remain in `UzumeApp` — the engine defines the error identity; the app defines the human copy.

**Decision 2 — `presentationMode` as a property, not a type hierarchy.**
`UserFacingError` exposes `presentationMode: PresentationMode` (`.inline` / `.toast` / `.banner` / `.fullScreen`) instead of sub-classing or using associated-value enums per mode. The view layer switches on `presentationMode` to route to `ToastView`, `TopBannerView`, or `PreparationFailureView`. This keeps routing logic in Swift, not in a protocol hierarchy, and makes adding a new presentation mode a one-line enum change rather than a protocol conformance.

**Decision 3 — Condition-ID semantics on `UzumeToast`.**
Persistent degradation toasts (silence, low input level) must not stack on repeated triggers and must auto-dismiss on recovery. The chosen mechanism: `UzumeToast.conditionID: String?` + `ToastManager.dismissByCondition(_:)` + `PlaybackErrorConditionTracker`. The tracker is separate from `ToastManager` so `PlaybackErrorBridge` can check "is this condition already displayed?" without coupling to `ToastManager`'s internal queue representation. The condition ID for silence is `"silence.extended"` (derived from `UserFacingError.silenceExtended.conditionID`).

**Decision 4 — 15s silence threshold (was 30s in `SilenceToastBridge`).**
`UX_SPEC §9.4` specifies >15s sustained silence triggers the degradation toast. The prior `SilenceToastBridge` fired at 30s, which was a pre-U.7 stub value. `PlaybackErrorBridge` corrects this to match the spec.

**Rejected alternative:** Store condition state in `ToastManager` itself (no separate tracker). Rejected because `ToastManager` would then need to be queried by `PlaybackErrorBridge` both to check state and to enqueue — creating a tighter coupling that makes unit testing harder (two concerns in one object).

## D-054 — AccessibilityState architecture and beat-clamp boundary (Increment U.9)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-24)

**Context:** U.9 requires three coordinated changes: (1) gate mv_warp and SSGI execution when reduce-motion is active, (2) clamp beat-pulse amplitude to 0.5× when reduce-motion is active, (3) integrate the user's `ReducedMotionPreference` setting with the system `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` flag into a single source of truth.

**Decision — AccessibilityState:**
`AccessibilityState` (`@MainActor final class ObservableObject`) is the single source of truth. It combines `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion` (observed via `NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayOptionsDidChangeNotification`) with `ReducedMotionPreference` from `SettingsStore`. The three-way logic:
- `.matchSystem` → `reduceMotion = systemReduceMotion`
- `.alwaysOn` → `reduceMotion = true`
- `.alwaysOff` → `reduceMotion = false`

`SessionStateViewModel` takes `accessibilityState: AccessibilityState` at init; `PlaybackChromeViewModel` subscribes via injected `AnyPublisher<Bool, Never>`. This keeps both view models unit-testable via stub publishers without depending on real NSWorkspace state.

**Decision — beat-clamp boundary:**
The beat-clamp is applied in `RenderPipeline.draw(in:)` to the local `FeatureVector` copy, before it is passed to `renderFrame`. Affected fields: `beatBass`, `beatMid`, `beatTreble`, `beatComposite`. NOT clamped: `beatPhase01`, `beatsUntilNext` — these are BeatPredictor timing primitives that drive anticipatory animation timing, not pulse amplitude.

Placement at the `draw` boundary means all downstream paths (direct, mesh, ray-march, mv_warp, ICB) share the same clamped vector without each needing to know about reduce-motion state.

**Decision — mv_warp gate:**
`frameReduceMotion: Bool` on `RenderPipeline` (set by app layer from `AccessibilityState.reduceMotion`). Checked at top of `drawWithMVWarp()` — when true, `drawMVWarpReducedMotion()` renders a single frame without feedback accumulation (avoids both the motion and the GPU cost of the warp pass).

**Decision — SSGI gate:**
`reducedMotion: Bool` on `RayMarchPipeline`. SSGI pass fires only when `ssgiEnabled && !reducedMotion`. SSGI is the temporally-accumulating screen-space pass most likely to cause discomfort; skipping it costs no visual quality under reduce-motion because the feedback smear is the discomfort source.

**Deferred:** Strict photosensitivity mode (flash frequency analysis + blanking); SSGI temporal accumulation gate distinct from the frame-level `reducedMotion` flag.

## D-053 — PresetScoringContext extended with excludedFamilies + qualityCeiling; defaults preserve backward compat (Increment U.8)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-24)

**Context:** U.8 Settings adds two user-configurable gates that must influence preset selection: a family blocklist and a quality ceiling. These gates belong in `PresetScoringContext` (the immutable snapshot passed to `DefaultPresetScorer`) rather than in the scorer's internal logic, so the context remains the single source of truth for session state at scoring time.

**Decision:** Add `excludedFamilies: Set<PresetCategory> = []` and `qualityCeiling: QualityCeiling = .auto` to `PresetScoringContext`, both with defaults. All existing callers that omit the new params continue to compile and behave identically (empty blocklist, auto ceiling). `DefaultPresetScorer.exclusionReason` checks `excludedFamilies` first, then applies `qualityCeiling.complexityThresholdMs(for:)` as the budget cap (`.ultra` returns nil → no complexity gate; `.performance` returns 12 ms → stricter than the frame budget).

**`QualityCeiling` placement:** New enum in `Orchestrator` module (not `Presets`). It maps to scoring logic (complexity thresholds) rather than to visual/preset metadata. `PresetScoringContext` already imports `Orchestrator`-local types, so no new cross-module dependencies are introduced.

**`PresetScoringContextProvider` (Part C):** Reads `settingsStore.excludedPresetCategories` and `settingsStore.qualityCeiling` and propagates them through `build()`. This is the only call site that needs updating — all other `PresetScoringContext` constructions (engine tests, golden session tests) use the defaults.


## D-057 — Frame Budget Manager: governor design, OR-gate pattern, tier targets, and scope limits (Increment 6.2)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-04-25)

**Decision — Per-tier configuration targets:**
Tier 1 (M1/M2) uses `targetFrameMs = 14.0` ms with `overrunMarginMs = 0.3` ms. Tier 2 (M3+) uses `targetFrameMs = 16.0` ms with `overrunMarginMs = 0.5` ms. Tier 1 has a tighter target because M1/M2 have less headroom at 60fps — the 14ms target gives the Core Audio tap and Swift overhead ~2.6ms of slack. Tier 2's 16ms target matches the V-sync period exactly; the 0.5ms margin accounts for frame-presentation jitter.

**Decision — Asymmetric hysteresis:**
3 consecutive overruns to downshift; 180 consecutive sub-budget frames to upshift. The asymmetry is intentional: downshift must be fast (users notice dropped frames immediately) but upshift must be slow (a single lucky frame after 2s of budget pressure should not restore full quality and cause another drop). 180 frames = 3 seconds at 60fps. A "hysteresis band" frame (within the overrun threshold but not low enough to count as recovery) resets both counters — it is neither progress nor regression.

> **AMENDED at RECON.18 (2026-08-26) — the OR-gate is RETIRED.** It existed solely to arbitrate SSGI suppression between the a11y and governor paths. SSGI was deleted (Matt's park-or-delete call on the dormant capabilities), so `RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion`, `a11yReducedMotion`, `governorSkipsSSGI` and their setters went with it, along with `RayMarchPipelineGovernorIntegrationTests`. **The a11y feature is unaffected:** reduced motion has three arms and only the SSGI one is gone — the mv_warp single-frame path (`shouldExecuteMVWarp`) and `beatAmplitudeScale = 0.5` both remain, and the SSGI arm had been inert anyway since no preset ever declared the pass. The `.noSSGI` quality rung went with it; the ladder is now `full → noBloom → reducedRayMarch → reducedParticles → reducedMesh`.

**Decision — OR-gate for SSGI suppression (reducedMotion):**
`RayMarchPipeline.reducedMotion` was previously a single mutable Bool set by both the a11y path (via `AccessibilityState`) and the governor path (via `applyQualityLevel`). The problem: governor recovery calling `reducedMotion = false` would silently override an active accessibility preference. The fix introduces two private flags — `a11yReducedMotion` and `governorSkipsSSGI` — with dedicated setters and a computed `reducedMotion = a11yReducedMotion || governorSkipsSSGI`. This guarantees that a user who needs reduced motion for medical reasons cannot have SSGI re-enabled by the governor recovering from a transient performance blip. The OR-gate is a formal architectural guarantee, not a runtime check.

**Decision — Governor exempt under QualityCeiling.ultra:**
When `SettingsStore.qualityCeiling == .ultra`, `FrameBudgetManager` is initialised with `enabled: false`. `observe()` becomes a no-op and always returns `.full`. This respects the user's explicit preference for maximum visual quality at the cost of potential frame drops. The exemption is set once at `VisualizerEngine.init()` by reading `UserDefaults` directly (the engine init predates `SettingsStore`); a `SettingsStore` observer to live-toggle this is deferred.

**Decision — Governor never modifies `activePasses`:**
The frame budget governor operates exclusively through five scalar properties: `governorSkipsSSGI` (Bool), `bloomEnabled` (Bool), `stepCountMultiplier` (Float), `activeParticleFraction` (Float), `densityMultiplier` (Float). It never adds, removes, or reorders entries in `RenderPipeline.activePasses`. This constraint keeps the governor from invalidating MTLRenderCommandEncoder setup paths — pass gating at the encoder level would require rebuilding the entire render graph. Instead each subsystem degrades gracefully in-place: SSGI is skipped inside `RayMarchPipeline`'s lighting pass via `ssgiEnabled && !reducedMotion`; bloom is bypassed within `PostProcessChain.runBloomAndComposite` without removing the post-process pass itself.

**Decision — densityMultiplier is a no-op on M1/M2 vertex fallback:**
`MeshGenerator.densityMultiplier` is passed to the object and mesh shader stages at buffer(1) on M3+ hardware. On M1/M2, `MeshGenerator` dispatches a standard vertex pipeline (fullscreen triangle or instanced geometry); the buffer(1) write still occurs but no shader reads it. The M1/M2 fallback draws a fixed geometry count. This is acceptable because M1/M2 are Tier 1 devices — they reach `.reducedMesh` only under severe sustained load, at which point the larger gains from SSGI-off + bloom-off + reduced ray march steps are already in effect. A dedicated M1/M2 vertex-count reduction path is out of scope for 6.2.

**Decision — One-frame governor lag by design:**
`commandBuffer.addCompletedHandler` fires asynchronously after GPU completion. The handler bounces to `@MainActor` and calls `applyQualityLevel`, which takes effect at the start of the next `draw(in:)` call. This means the governor reacts to frame N's timing during frame N+1 setup. A zero-lag architecture would require predicting budget violations before encoding, which is not feasible. The one-frame lag is invisible at 60fps and eliminates any risk of the governor mutating render state mid-encoding.

## D-058 — U.6b live-adaptation keyboard semantics: architecture and undo semantics

### Context

Increment U.6b wires the seven `PlaybackActionRouter` keyboard actions stubbed in U.6. Several architectural decisions were required:

**(a) Family boost is additive on the final 0–1 score, not multiplicative on sub-scores.**

`context.familyBoosts[family] ?? 0` is added to `raw * familyMult * fatigueMult` before clamping, keeping it fully independent of the four-weight structure established in D-032. A multiplicative approach would compound with the fatigue and repeat penalties in non-obvious ways; an additive approach on the final score is transparent ("always +0.3 for this family, regardless of other factors"). Boost is capped at 0.3 and idempotent (pressing `+` twice gives 0.3, not 0.6).

**(b) `undoLastAdaptation()` restores `livePlan` only, NOT the boost/exclusion state.** **⚠ RE-EVALUATE (audit 2026-05-13):** flagged as deliberate-but-surprising — a user who pressed `-` to dislike a family and then `⌘Z` to undo may expect both the swap AND the preference to revert. Current rationale (rationale paragraph below) is sound but worth a UX check the next time live adaptation is exercised on a real session.

`adaptationHistory` stores `PlannedSession` snapshots, which are the plan. Preference state (`familyBoosts`, `temporaryFamilyExclusions`, `sessionExcludedPresets`) is intentionally NOT reverted by undo. Rationale: a user who pressed `-` to dislike a family and then `⌘Z` to undo the preset swap did not express a desire to re-include that family — they may just want to go back to the previous visual. Clearing preference state on undo would be surprising. Users who want to fully reverse a `-` can wait 10 minutes for the exclusion to expire.

**(c) `LiveAdaptationToastBridge` default changed to `true` for fresh installs.**

The `isEnabled` check now reads `UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey:)` first. If the key is absent (new install), it returns `true`. If the key is present (user has explicitly set it either way), it reads the stored bool. This preserves existing users' explicit choice while shipping the feature on by default.

**(d) `adaptationHistory` capacity is 8.**

Typical in-session adaptation depth is 2–4 actions (a couple of `+`/`-` presses and maybe one reshuffle). 8 entries covers the 99th percentile of realistic use and keeps memory overhead trivially small. Entries are plain `PlannedSession` values (a handful of structs); 8 × ~2 KB ≈ 16 KB maximum.

**(e) Adaptation preference state lives on `DefaultPlaybackActionRouter`, not `VisualizerEngine`.**

The spec draft suggested placing U.6b state on `VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator`, but this would make app-layer unit tests impossible without a Metal context. Following the protocol-first / injectable-closures pattern already established in `PlanPreviewViewModel` and `PlaybackChromeViewModel`, all preference state (`familyBoosts`, `temporaryFamilyExclusions`, etc.) lives on the router. The engine reads it back at plan-build time via the `adaptationFields(at:)` snapshot method. This keeps the router fully unit-testable with pure Swift.

## D-059 — ML Dispatch Scheduling: scheduler design, budget signal, deferral caps (Increment 6.3)

### Context

`MLDispatchScheduler` coordinates MPSGraph stem separation with render-loop frame timing. When the GPU is stressed by a heavy ray-march+SSGI frame, a 142ms stem-separation burst landing on top of it causes a visible double-jank. The scheduler defers the 5s separation timer to a lighter moment rather than firing blindly.

**(a) Scheduler reads `recentMaxFrameMs` rather than `FrameBudgetManager.currentLevel`.**

`currentLevel` reflects long-term hysteresis: it can remain degraded for 180 frames after the renderer has actually recovered (per D-057's asymmetric upshift window). For ML scheduling we need the tighter "is the render clean right now?" signal. `recentMaxFrameMs` is the worst frame in the last 30-frame rolling window — it falls immediately when jank clears, giving the scheduler accurate real-time feedback. Using `currentLevel` would defer ML dispatches for up to 3 seconds after recovery, which is not useful.

**(b) `maxDeferralMs`: 2000 ms Tier 1, 1500 ms Tier 2. `requireCleanFramesCount`: 30 Tier 1, 20 Tier 2.**

Stem features from the 5s background cycle already lag real audio by 5–10 seconds (Increment 3.5.4.9 — per-frame analysis from cached waveforms continues regardless). Adding 2 s of ML deferral extends that lag to at most 7–12 s, which is within the acceptable range for preset routing freshness. Tier 2 (M3+) gets a tighter 1500 ms cap because jank is rarer on M3+ hardware; when it does occur, recovery is faster and the scheduler can react sooner.

**(c) Deferral always retries — never drops.**

A dropped stem dispatch means stems go completely stale for a full 5 s cycle, producing a visible freeze-and-jump in stem-driven preset visuals (the original defect fixed by Increment 3.5.4.9). Retrying every 100 ms with a hard force-dispatch ceiling guarantees stems are refreshed within `maxDeferralMs` of when they were requested, accepting one over-budget frame to prevent multi-second stem freeze.

**(d) Scheduler exempt under `QualityCeiling.ultra`.**

Recording mode wants consistent ML cadence at all times — frame consistency is more important than jank avoidance when producing a diagnostic capture. `enabled = false` when ultra; every `decide()` call returns `.dispatchNow` immediately.

**(e) `FrameTimingProviding` protocol for testability; single rolling buffer.**

The scheduler reads `recentMaxFrameMs` / `recentFramesObserved` via `FrameTimingProviding`, which both `FrameBudgetManager` and test stubs conform to. There is no parallel timing collection in the scheduler itself — `FrameBudgetManager.observe(_:)` records every frame into a 30-slot circular buffer shared by both the governor hysteresis logic and the ML scheduler. This is a single source of truth; duplicating the buffer would create divergence risk.

## D-064 — Increment V.5: visual references library structure, rubric-exempt classification, lint tool placement, and quality reel capture approach

### Context

Increment V.5 creates `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` — the fidelity contract enforcing per-preset trait requirements across V.7+ authoring sessions. Four design decisions required recording.

### Decisions

**(a) Per-preset README structure: full-rubric vs lightweight variant.**

Two README variants were introduced. **Full-rubric** applies to the 9 artistic presets (Arachne, FerrofluidOcean, FractalTree, GlassBrutalist, Gossamer, KineticSculpture, Membrane, Starburst, VolumetricLithograph). The README carries three rubric sections (mandatory 7/7, expected ≥2/4, strongly preferred ≥1/4) matching `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12`. **Lightweight** applies to 4 presets: Plasma (demoscene hypnotic, family `hypnotic`), Waveform (family `waveform`, diagnostic spectrum view), Nebula (family `particles`, stylized particle system), SpectralCartograph (family `instrument`, diagnostic instrumentation panel). Lightweight READMEs replace the three rubric sections with a single "Stylization contract" listing what *does* matter: color modulation by audio energy, audio coverage, and readability at silence and peak. The four-layer detail cascade and 3+ material count are not meaningful requirements for these presets.

Membrane (family `fluid`, passes `feedback`) was classified as full-rubric because it is an artistic feedback-loop fluid preset with depth potential for meso/micro detail and material variation, despite being a simpler render path than a ray march preset.

**(b) Rubric-exempt list and rationale.**

The four lightweight presets and their exemption reasons:
- **Plasma** (`hypnotic/direct`): Demoscene interference-pattern aesthetic; the "3 distinct materials" and "4-layer detail cascade" requirements are undefined for a 2D colour-field shader. The relevant contract is: hue/saturation modulation must remain readable at silence vs peak energy.
- **Waveform** (`waveform/direct`): Diagnostic spectrum visualiser. Rubric does not apply; the relevant contract is legibility and colour accuracy at all signal levels.
- **Nebula** (`particles/direct`): Stylized particle system. No geometry cascade or material system; the particle render path doesn't support PBR materials. The relevant contract is palette coherence and emission density tied to energy.
- **SpectralCartograph** (`instrument/direct`): Four-panel MIR diagnostic. This is an instrument, not an aesthetic preset. The rubric has no meaningful application. The relevant contract is readability and correctness of displayed MIR data.

**(c) Lint tool placement: UzumeTools (new package) vs UzumeEngine (existing).**

The `CheckVisualReferences` lint CLI was placed in a new `UzumeTools/` package rather than in `UzumeEngine/Sources/`. Rationale: the lint check has no runtime dependency on the UzumeEngine module graph (Audio, DSP, ML, Renderer, etc.); bundling it in UzumeEngine would add build-time cost to a tool with no coupling to that code. A separate lightweight package (`UzumeTools/Package.swift`) depends only on `swift-argument-parser`. This also establishes the package location for future `UzumeTools/MilkdropTranspiler` (Phase MD.1+), consistent with `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md §Phase MD`.

The lint tool discovers presets by replicating `PresetLoader`'s flat filesystem scan (`Shaders/*.metal`, excluding `ShaderUtilities.metal`), so the preset list is always authoritative without importing the runtime module. This avoids hardcoding and keeps the lint correct even as new presets are added.

Default mode: fail-soft (prints warnings, exits 0). `--strict` flag: exits non-zero on any warning. The default flips to strict in V.6 once Matt's curation is complete; the decision is documented here to prevent the flip from being forgotten.

**(d) Quality reel capture: QuickTime, not in-engine pipeline.**

The quality reel (`docs/quality_reel.mp4`) is captured using macOS QuickTime Screen Recording (Cmd+Shift+5). An in-engine capture pipeline (ScreenCaptureKit video output, AVAssetWriter, frame-paced recording loop) was explicitly ruled out. Uzume already uses ScreenCaptureKit for audio; adding simultaneous video output introduces a cross-cutting concern: frame-pacing interaction with the Metal render loop, `AVAssetWriter` initialization timing, drawable-size locking (see Failed Approach #28), and file-handling at session boundaries. These concerns have nothing to do with V.5's curation-framework scope. QuickTime delivers adequate quality (H.264 1080p60) with zero engine risk. The no-in-engine-capture decision is enforced in `RUNBOOK.md § Recording the quality reel`.

### What Was Rejected

- **Plasma and Waveform as full-rubric with a "2D exemption" on the cascade**: Creates a half-measured rubric that's harder to verify than a clean lightweight/full split. The distinction is clearer as a discrete variant than as per-rule exemptions.
- **Nebula as full-rubric (borderline)**: Nebula uses a `particles` pass, which has no PBR material system or geometry detail cascade. Treating it as full-rubric would require fabricating rubric compliance for requirements the render path fundamentally doesn't support.
- **Bash script for the lint check**: A bash script would hardcode the preset list (drift risk when new presets land) or use `find` + string manipulation to discover them (fragile). Swift CLI reads the same `Shaders/` directory that `PresetLoader` reads; the canonical preset list can never drift.
- **UzumeEngine/Sources/CheckVisualReferences/**: Placing the tool inside UzumeEngine was the V.4 pattern (`UtilityCostTableUpdater`). Rejected here because that tool needs `ArgumentParser` only and has zero runtime coupling; a new lightweight `UzumeTools` package communicates the separation clearly and sets the precedent for Phase MD tooling.

## D-065 — §2.3 amendment: composite-preset image counts and AI-generated anti-reference carve-out

**Status:** Accepted

### Context

`SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.1` step 2 (established in D-064 / Increment V.5) specifies "3–5 reference images" per preset. `§2.3` of the same document requires that references be "curated, not AI-generated." Two divergences from these rules surfaced during Ferrofluid Ocean reference curation (V.9, pre-implementation):

1. **Composite-preset image count.** Ferrofluid Ocean's traits are not contained in any single photographable subject. The §10.3 spec borrows from ferrofluid lab macro, salt flats, dark coastlines, lotus leaves, sculpture lighting, storm photography, and underwater photography. Each trait requires its own dedicated reference; the resulting folder contains 11 images, well past the §2.1 "3–5" target. Trimming would require collapsing distinct-trait references into composites, forcing Claude Code sessions to read traits from images that aren't dedicated to teaching them.

2. **Anti-reference sourcing.** The anti-reference slot (`05_anti_*`) depicts a *failure mode* of the preset, not a target. For Ferrofluid Ocean the most pedagogically useful anti-reference is "ferrofluid that has lost its Rosensweig spike topology and become a generic chrome blob" — a phenomenon that does not occur in nature and therefore cannot be photographed. The alternatives are an AI-generated image of the failure mode, or a v1-baseline frame capture from the preset's existing implementation; the v1 capture is the long-term right answer but is not available pre-implementation.

### Decisions

**(a) Image count target softened from "3–5" to "3–5 typical, more permitted for composite presets, each image must isolate a distinct trait."**

`SHADER_CRAFT.md §2.1` step 2 amended. The 3–5 target is preserved as the default expectation; composite presets earn additional images by per-image trait justification, not by padding. The lint tool (`CheckVisualReferences`, D-064) is unchanged — it does not enforce a count ceiling, only that each preset has a populated folder with conformant filenames.

**(b) §2.3 amended to permit AI-generated images in the anti-reference slot only, under a narrow carve-out.**

Carve-out conditions:
- Only the anti-reference slot (`05_anti_*`).
- Filename must carry the `_AIGEN` suffix (e.g. `05_anti_chrome_blob_AIGEN.jpg`) so the AI provenance is visible in any session prompt that cites the file.
- README annotation must state that *every* trait of the image is anti — there is no partial-trust read of any visual property.
- README Provenance section must record a replacement plan, typically a v1-baseline frame capture, to be substituted when the preset's first implementation ships.

The carve-out does not extend to any other slot (`01_macro_*` through `04_specular_*`, `06_palette_*`, `07_atmosphere_*`, `08_lighting_*`, `09_*`). Real photography or controlled in-engine capture remains mandatory for those slots.

**(c) "Actively disregard" annotation convention promoted to a rule-level requirement.**

Reference annotations must specify three things, not two: (1) which traits are mandatory, (2) which are decorative, and (3) which traits of the image must be *actively disregarded* by Claude Code sessions reading the folder. The third category is added because real photography routinely contains structural cues that read as directives but are not — e.g. the radial vein pattern in a lotus-leaf droplet reference is not a directive about spike arrangement, and the colored gels in studio ferrofluid macros are not directives about palette. Without explicit disregard annotations, the more references a folder accumulates, the more confounders Claude Code sessions ingest. The Ferrofluid Ocean folder demonstrates the pattern; future preset folders inherit the convention.

### What Was Rejected

- **Hard image-count ceiling (e.g. "≤8 images per folder").** Would force composite presets to collapse distinct-trait references into composites, defeating the purpose of per-image annotation. The right enforcement is per-image trait justification, not a count.
- **Blanket AI-generation permission.** Would erode the §2.3 "curated > generated" intent in the cases where it actually matters (the target-trait slots). Confining the carve-out to the anti-reference slot preserves the rule's force everywhere it's pedagogically meaningful.
- **No `_AIGEN` suffix; AI-provenance only in the README.** Filename suffix is enforceable by lint and visible in session prompts; README-only disclosure is forgettable.
- **Permanent acceptance of AI-generated anti-references.** The replacement-plan requirement (v1-baseline capture once the preset ships) ensures AI generation is a stopgap, not a permanent feature of the reference library.

## D-067 — V.6 certification pipeline: module placement, lightweight exemptions, manual gate, and fallback behavior (Increment V.6)

**Status:** Accepted

### (a) Module placement: Presets, not Renderer

The rubric analyzer lives in `Sources/Presets/Certification/`, not `Sources/Renderer/`. The Renderer module depends on Presets (for `PresetDescriptor`), but not vice versa. Placing `FidelityRubric` in Renderer would require Renderer to circularly import Presets, or would force `PresetDescriptor` out of Presets. Placing it in Presets keeps the dependency graph acyclic and requires no `Package.swift` changes.

### (b) Lightweight profile exemptions

Plasma, Waveform, Nebula, and SpectralCartograph use a 4-item lightweight rubric (L1 silence, L2 deviation primitives, L3 perf, L4 frame match) instead of the full 15-item ladder. These presets are either 2D spectrum visualizers (Waveform/Plasma) or diagnostic panels (SpectralCartograph) where detail cascade, 3D material count, and triplanar texturing are inapplicable by design. The exemption is declared per-preset via `"rubric_profile": "lightweight"` in the JSON sidecar. `DefaultFidelityRubric` routes to a separate 4-item evaluation path. See D-064 for the original classification rationale.

### (c) `certified` is manual-only

The `certified: Bool` field is never set to `true` by automation. `meetsAutomatedGate` captures what the static/runtime analyzer can verify; the `certified` field is exclusively Matt's signal after a reference-frame match review against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/`. The two flags are intentionally separate so a preset can pass all automatable items and still await manual review. `RubricResult.isCertified = meetsAutomatedGate && certified`.

### (d) All-uncertified fallback: warn, do not throw

When all presets score 0 (all uncertified, toggle off), `DefaultSessionPlanner` already has a `noEligiblePresets` path that emits a `PlanningWarning` and falls back to the cheapest non-excluded preset. No new error case is needed. The window between V.6 landing and Matt's first certification flip is handled by this existing ladder — users with the toggle off get the cheapest preset rather than an error.

## D-073 — `maxDuration` per-section linger factors inverted (Option B); diagnostic class added (V.7.6.C calibration)

**Date:** 2026-05-03

**Context:** V.7.6.2 shipped the `maxDuration` framework (formula in `PresetMaxDuration.swift`, computed property on `PresetDescriptor`, multi-segment walk in `SessionPlanner`). V.7.6.C is the calibration pass against the §5.3 reference table. Matt reviewed the printed table at the §5.2 default coefficients.

**Problems Matt flagged:**

1. **Spectral Cartograph is diagnostic, not aesthetic.** The framework was treating it as a normal preset and giving it a finite ceiling. Diagnostics should remain in place until manually switched — they have a different operational role (instrument-family observability) and the segment scheduler should never insert a boundary mid-diagnostic.
2. **Per-section linger model was inverted.** Original §5.2 had `ambient=0.30` (shortest) and `peak=0.80` (longest), on the theory that low-variance audio gives the preset less to chew on. Matt's intuition is the opposite: ambient sections are exactly where you'd want a preset to *linger* — meditative, contemplative, a switch would feel disruptive.

**Decision:**

(1) **Add diagnostic class.** New `is_diagnostic` JSON field on `PresetDescriptor` (default `false`). When true, `maxDuration(forSection:)` short-circuits to `.infinity`. Spectral Cartograph is flagged true (only diagnostic in the catalog). Implementation is one boolean and one short-circuit; no formula change. The broader "diagnostic presets are manual-switch only / never auto-selected" semantic (Scorer hard-exclusion + LiveAdapter no-override) is **out of V.7.6.C scope**, scheduled as V.7.6.D.

(2) **Invert per-section linger to Option B.** Two models considered: Option A — linger on slow only (ambient=0.80, peak=0.30); Option B — linger on emotional cores (ambient=0.80, peak=0.75) with transitional sections shortened (buildup=0.40, bridge=0.35). Matt picked Option B: ambient and peak both linger because they're the emotional-core moments of a song; buildup and bridge are transitional moments where preset changes feel natural. Final table: `ambient=0.80, peak=0.75, comedown=0.65, buildup=0.40, bridge=0.35`. Default (section=nil) stays 0.5. Field renamed `sectionDynamicRange` → `sectionLingerFactor` to reflect that values are now author-set per-section weights, not derived from audio variance.

(3) **No formula coefficient changes.** `baseDurationSeconds=90`, `motionPenalty=-50`, `fatiguePenalty=-30`, `densityPenalty=-15`, `sectionAdjustBase=0.7`, `sectionLingerWeight=0.6` all unchanged. The original V.7.6.2 agent's calibration notes (Glass Brutalist ~30s intuition; Gossamer feels long for limited compositional variation; Murmuration computes same as Glass Brutalist) were observations, not directives. Matt's V.7.6.C review note: *"Note that you are grading presets that are all not certified and VERY far from ready."* Tuning the formula to one uncertified outlier optimises for an artistic target the preset hasn't reached yet. If a future certified Glass Brutalist genuinely cycles every 30s, declaring `natural_cycle_seconds: 30` is the right tool, not a coefficient warp.

**Why no Glass Brutalist `naturalCycleSeconds` cap landed in V.7.6.C:** The 30s intuition was from the V.7.6.2 agent, not directly from Matt. Matt's review explicitly flagged that the presets are uncertified and far from ready. Adding a cap now would lock in a number that's likely wrong for the certified version of the preset.

**§5.3 reference table is now authoritative against current production sidecars.** Old §5.3 had several stale metadata values (e.g. Plasma motion 0.85 vs actual 0.5, Nebula 0.50 vs actual 0.30); the V.7.6.C rewrite reflects what's actually in the JSON. Stalker dropped (no production assets in `Shaders/`); Fractal Tree added.

**Implementation:** `PresetMaxDuration.swift` (formula + linger factors), `PresetDescriptor.swift` (`isDiagnostic` field + CodingKeys + decode), `SpectralCartograph.json` (`is_diagnostic: true`), `MaxDurationFrameworkTests.swift` (reference table + diagnostic test + Option B ordering test + `isDiagnostic` default test), `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md` §5.2/§5.3/§5.4 updated.

**Verification:** 912 engine tests / 97 suites green. App build succeeds. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. GoldenSessionTests not regenerated — default-section maxDuration unchanged at lingerFactor=0.5 (multiplier 1.0); planner sequences identical.

**Rule:** Per-section weights in the `maxDuration` framework are author-set linger factors, not audio-variance signals. Naming reflects that. Future calibration sessions tune the per-section table by intuition, not by computing audio variance from track preparation data.

**Rule:** Diagnostic presets (`is_diagnostic: true`) are exempt from segment scheduling and (per the V.7.6.D follow-up) auto-selection. They are operational tools, not aesthetic content. Spectral Cartograph is the prototype; future diagnostics use the same flag.

**Rule:** Do not coefficient-tune the `maxDuration` formula to an uncertified preset's intuition target. Use `natural_cycle_seconds` for outliers only when the visual genuinely has a fixed cycle. If the artistic target moves with certification, the coefficient-tuned value will become wrong.

## D-074 — Diagnostic preset orchestrator semantics (V.7.6.D)

> **⚠ RE-EVALUATE (audit 2026-05-13).** Categorical exclusion of diagnostic presets from scoring + live adaptation + reactive mode. Currently the only diagnostic preset is Spectral Cartograph, and there is no realistic scenario where it would be auto-selected — so the rule is over-general for the one consumer it has. Worth a revisit when a second diagnostic preset ships, or when the manual-switch path is exercised in a way that surfaces friction.

**Date:** 2026-05-03

**Context:** V.7.6.C (D-073) added the `is_diagnostic` flag with one effect — `maxDuration(forSection:)` returns `.infinity` so `SessionPlanner` never inserts a segment boundary mid-diagnostic. The broader semantic — diagnostics are operational tools, not aesthetic content, so they must never be auto-selected, never receive a mid-track override, and only render via manual switch — was scoped as a V.7.6.D follow-up.

**Decision:** Extend the flag's effect into the Orchestrator at three surfaces:

1. **`DefaultPresetScorer` hard exclusion.** A new gate runs *first* in `exclusionReasonAndTag`, before the certification check, and returns `excludedReason: "diagnostic"` with `total: 0`. Unlike `includeUncertifiedPresets`, there is no settings toggle that re-enables diagnostics for auto-selection — the gate is categorical.
2. **`DefaultLiveAdapter` emission-site guard.** The mood-override path's `guard let (topPreset, topScore) = ranked.first, …` is extended with `!topPreset.isDiagnostic`. The Scorer change already gives diagnostics `total = 0`, but the explicit guard at the emission site is harder to regress when the scoring math changes.
3. **`DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` defensive filter.** The `ranked.first` selection becomes `ranked.first(where: { !$0.0.isDiagnostic })` so a degenerate catalog (e.g. all-zero scoring tie containing diagnostics) cannot resurrect one.

`SessionPlanner` and the multi-segment walker inherit the gate transparently because they consume `PresetScoring` — no planner-level change needed; tests confirm diagnostics never appear in `plan.tracks[].preset`.

**Manual-switch path is unchanged.** `PlaybackActionRouter` and the keyboard / dev surfaces operate on `PresetDescriptor` directly without going through scoring. The exclusion is auto-only by design — diagnostics like Spectral Cartograph remain reachable through the existing manual paths.

**Implementation:** `PresetScorer.swift` (new diagnostic exclusion as first gate), `LiveAdapter.swift` (one-line guard on the override-emission `guard`), `ReactiveOrchestrator.swift` (`first(where:)` filter), `OrchestratorDiagnosticExclusionTests.swift` (7 tests covering scorer, adapter, planner, reactive, and the manual-switch positive case).

**Verification:** 919 engine tests / 98 suites; 918 pass — the single failure is the pre-existing flaky `MetadataPreFetcherTests.fetch_networkTimeout_returnsWithinBudget` (network timing under load, unrelated). App build succeeds. SwiftLint 0 violations on touched files. `GoldenSessionTests` unchanged — diagnostic presets were already absent from production goldens (Spectral Cartograph carries `certified: false`), so the additional gate is a no-op against current sequences.

**Rule:** Diagnostic presets are categorically excluded from auto-selection at every Orchestrator surface. The exclusion fires before certification, before family boost, before any user toggle. The only path that renders a diagnostic is manual switch on the renderer/keyboard surface, which bypasses scoring entirely.

**Rule:** When a flag has both a data-model effect and an Orchestrator-policy effect (like `is_diagnostic`), implement the data-model effect first (here: `maxDuration` short-circuit, V.7.6.C / D-073) and the policy effect second (here: scorer + adapter exclusions, V.7.6.D / D-074). Splitting keeps each commit's blast radius small and lets each layer's tests be written and reviewed independently.

## D-075 — Tempo BPM via sub_bass-only onset timestamps + trimmed-mean IOI (DSP.1)

**Date:** 2026-05-03

**Context:** The IOI histogram in `BeatDetector+Tempo.swift` was producing systematic tempo errors on real music — Failed Approach #17 ("autocorrelation half-tempo, known octave error") in CLAUDE.md. The DSP.1 increment was originally scoped as IOI histogram half/double voting (a scoring pass over harmonic candidates {0.5×, 0.667×, 1×, 1.5×, 2×} of the histogram peak). A diagnostic harness (`UzumeEngine/Sources/TempoDumpRunner` + `Scripts/analyze_tempo_baselines.py`) capturing per-band onset timestamps on three reference clips (Love Rehab @ 125 BPM, So What @ 136 BPM, There There rock-syncopated) revealed the failures were not classical octave errors and that voting could not fix them.

**Two diagnoses surfaced:**

1. **Fusion frame-aliasing.** `recordOnsetTimestamps` consumed `bandFlux[0] + bandFlux[1]` (sub_bass + low_bass summed into a single threshold gate). Per-band cooldowns in `detectOnsets` (400 ms each) are independent across bands. A 60 Hz kick fires flux events in *both* bands at slightly different frames — the kick fundamental peaks first, the harmonic peaks one or two FFT-hop frames later. With sub_bass firing at frame 19 and low_bass firing at frame 18 of the next kick, the OR-stream produces alternating 18-frame (418 ms) and 19-frame (441 ms) IOIs for a true 441 ms (136 BPM) beat. Per-band fixtures showed clean meanIOI 440 ms for so_what's sub_bass alone; the fused stream's meanIOI was 322 ms.

2. **Histogram-mode quantization bias toward faster BPMs.** The histogram bucketed by `Int(round(60/ioi)) - 60` — integer BPM. BPM bucket widths *grow* with BPM in period space (the 144 BPM bucket spans 414–420 ms; the 136 BPM bucket spans 437–443 ms). So an evenly-quantized stream of 18-frame (418 ms) and 19-frame (441 ms) IOIs lands more events in the 144 bucket than the 136 bucket even when the underlying tempo is 136. Picking the histogram mode systematically biased toward 144.

**Decision — two changes shipped together as DSP.1 (commit `bbad760f`):**

1. **Source IOI timestamps from sub_bass `result.onsets[0]` only.** `recordOnsetTimestamps(onsets:bandFlux:)` now `guard onsets[0] else { return }`. Never OR with low_bass. The 400 ms `detectOnsets` cooldown gives clean kick-rate IOIs without bass-note pollution, and using a single band avoids the inter-band frame-aliasing entirely. Tracks with empty sub_bass fall through to the autocorrelation tempo path (`estimateTempo`) — graceful degradation, not silent failure.

2. **Replace histogram-mode BPM with trimmed-mean IOI (`computeRobustBPM`).** Compute median IOI over the 10 s window, drop IOIs outside [0.5×, 2×] median (rejecting outliers from dropped beats or fills), take the mean of the inliers, BPM = `60 / meanIOI`. The 80–160 octave clamp is preserved. Mean is FP-precise — meanIOI 440 ms maps to 60/0.440 = 136.36 BPM, exactly matching the audio. The histogram is still built (cheaply) for the diagnostic dump only; the BPM selection bypasses it.

**Reference-track results (pre-DSP.1 → post-DSP.1):**

| Track | True BPM | Pre | Post | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Love Rehab (Chaim) | 125 | 117 / 152 (cycling) | 122–126 | ±1 BPM |
| So What (Miles Davis) | 136 | 152 | 135–138 | ±2 BPM |
| There There (Radiohead) | ~86 (syncopated) | 144 | 137–140 | unfixed (kick rate, not meter) |

There There remains wrong because the bass kick is not on every beat — the histogram correctly reads the kick-pattern interval, but for syncopated rock the underlying meter is half that. This is a syncopation limitation outside DSP.1's scope and is the load-bearing motivation for DSP.2 (BeatNet, D-076 reserved).

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Voting over harmonic candidates (original DSP.1 scope).** Rejected after diagnosis — the failures aren't octave errors. love_rehab's histogram peak was 117 BPM, with autocorrelation independently agreeing at 117.45 BPM conf 0.93 across the run. Both methods read the same skewed evidence; voting over {58.5, 78, 117, 175.5, 234} cannot recover 125 because none of those are 125. The voting math was structurally inapplicable.
- **Fuse with hysteresis.** Keep the OR-of-bands but require sub_bass+low_bass agree within X frames before firing. Rejected — adds a tunable parameter without solving the underlying frame-aliasing; per-band cooldowns in `detectOnsets` already enforce within-band kick rate.
- **Band-picker (P75 of sub_bass vs low_bass, use whichever is louder).** Implemented and tested mid-iteration. Did not help — the picker oscillates frame-to-frame near the boundary, producing the same staggering artifacts as fusion.
- **300 ms minimum spacing widened from 150 ms.** Implemented mid-iteration and reverted. With sub_bass-only sourcing, the 400 ms `detectOnsets` cooldown already enforces clean spacing; the `recordOnsetTimestamps` guard is defensive only, and 150 ms is sufficient.
- **TempoCNN.** AGPL — incompatible with Uzume's MIT license.
- **Sound Analysis framework.** Genre-classification, not beat-tracking — orthogonal to BPM estimation.
- **aubio integration.** A native C library would be a real dependency the project has not taken on. Deferred to DSP.2's "stay within Swift / MPSGraph idiom" path; if BeatNet underperforms, aubio becomes a fallback option to revisit then.

**Consequences:**

- DSP.1 ships a tempo improvement for kick-on-the-beat tracks (electronic, jazz, most pop). Reference fixtures so_what and love_rehab are now within ±2 BPM of metadata; both were 10–20 % off pre-DSP.1.
- The histogram remains in the codebase for diagnostic-dump use only. Future tempo work should not re-introduce histogram-mode picking; mean-of-inlier-IOIs is the baseline.
- Tracks where the bass kick is not on every beat (syncopated rock, swing, hip-hop with off-beat kicks) remain unsolved. These motivate DSP.2 (BeatNet via MPSGraph). DSP.1 is the floor; DSP.2 raises the ceiling.
- The diagnostic harness (`TempoDumpRunner`, `analyze_tempo_baselines.py`, fetched 30 s preview fixtures) becomes permanent regression infrastructure for DSP.2 and any future tempo work. The fixtures themselves are gitignored (`Tests/Fixtures/tempo/`) — preview clips are licensed; users run `Scripts/fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh` locally to populate them.
- Failed Approach #17 in CLAUDE.md needs amendment: the "autocorrelation half-tempo" framing is inaccurate. The real failure was fusion-induced frame aliasing plus histogram-mode quantization bias, both of which are now fixed for the kick-on-the-beat case. Tracks where DSP.1 still fails (syncopated rock) fail for a *different* reason than #17 originally described — that's a beat-tracking-vs-tempo-estimation distinction belonging to DSP.2.

**Rule:** Tempo estimators that operate on inter-onset intervals must source events from a single, well-cooled band. Fusing onset events across bands (even by summing flux) creates frame-aliased spurious IOIs.

**Rule:** Do not bucket continuous quantities by integer-rounded BPM when the natural quantization is frame-period (in time, not BPM). Compute robust statistics (median, trimmed mean) directly on the period samples.

**Rule:** When a hypothesized failure mode (here: half-tempo octave error) is documented in `CLAUDE.md` and an increment is scoped against it, the *first* commit should be diagnostic instrumentation that captures the actual failure shape — not implementation of the fix. The DSP.1 voting work would have shipped uselessly without the per-band onset diagnostic that revealed the real bugs. Diagnostic-first applies even when the documented failure mode is widely known to the team.

## D-077 — Phase DSP.2 pivot from BeatNet to Beat This!

**2026-05-04.** Phase DSP.2 retargets the offline beat / downbeat path from BeatNet (Heydari & Duan, 2021 — CRNN + particle filter cascade, CC-BY-4.0) to Beat This! (Foscarin et al., ISMIR 2024 — transformer encoder, MIT). The product reason is single-sentence: complex meters are a load-bearing requirement for Uzume's beat lock (Pyramid Song 16/8, Money 7/4, Schism 7/8, swing tracks like So What), and BeatNet's particle filter is a known weak point on irregular meters whereas Beat This!'s self-attention captures whole-bar context.

**Alternatives considered:**

* **BeatNet (incumbent).** CRNN + particle filter, ~0.4 M params, native streaming mode (~84 ms latency), particle filter is the bottleneck on 5/4, 7/8, swing. Octave-error history per `docs/diagnostics/DSP.1-baseline-there_there.txt`. Stays vendored as a fallback per D-076 retirement note.
* **All-In-One** (Kim et al., ISMIR 2023). Joint beat / downbeat / section-boundary transformer. Strictly more capable than Beat This! for Uzume's needs (would also retire `StructuralAnalyzer` / `NoveltyDetector`), but two-axis scope creep in a single increment is too risky. Reserved as a follow-up; if All-In-One supersedes Beat This! later, the Sessions 2–7 architecture in this increment was designed to swap the model with no upstream / downstream changes.
* **madmom DBN beat tracker.** Offline DBN over autocorrelation; classical baseline. Older numbers, no MPS-graph-portable model, requires the full madmom Python runtime. Not viable.
* **Beat Transformer / BEAST.** Research code; no shipped pre-trained weights with a usable license. Not viable.

**Architectural placement:** Beat This! runs once per track during `SessionPreparer.prepareTrack` on the cached 30 s preview clip (the existing pre-analysis budget absorbs ~100–300 ms of transformer inference per track on M1). Output is cached on `TrackProfile` as a new `BeatGrid` value type (`beats`, `downbeats`, `bpm`, `timeSignature`, `confidence`, `modelVariant`). The live audio path *does not* run a transformer; instead, a new `LiveBeatDriftTracker` cross-correlates `BeatDetector`'s sub_bass onset stream against the cached grid in a ±50 ms phase window and emits a smooth drift estimate. `FeatureVector.beatPhase01` and `beatsUntilNext` are then computed analytically from `playbackTime + drift` against the cached grid — no contract change for any existing preset shader.

**Replaces:** `BeatPredictor` (deleted in Session 7); `BeatDetector+Tempo.computeRobustBPM` as the primary BPM source (kept only as ad-hoc reactive-mode fallback). `BeatDetector` itself stays — its onset stream is the input to the live drift tracker and continues to feed `StemAnalyzer` rich metadata. `StructuralAnalyzer` / `NoveltyDetector` are unchanged in this increment.

**License & attribution:** Beat This! ships under MIT (cleaner than BeatNet's CC-BY-4.0 attribution requirement). Attribution lives in `docs/CREDITS.md` and the shipped app's About surface; details locked in Session 1.

**Cleanup committed alongside this decision:** the in-flight BeatNet preprocessor stub (`UzumeEngine/Sources/DSP/LogSpectrogram.swift`), the vendored filterbank corner triples (`UzumeEngine/Sources/DSP/Resources/beatnet_filterbank.json`), the `dump_logspec_reference.py` reference dump script, and the `love_rehab_logspec_reference.json` test fixture were deleted. The architecture audit (`docs/diagnostics/DSP.2-architecture.md`) was renamed to `DSP.2-beatnet-archive.md` and marked superseded. The BeatNet weight set under `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/Weights/beatnet/` is retained.

**Spec drift discipline.** The trigger for the pivot was a Session-2-of-DSP.2 audit pass that found the BeatNet architecture doc had paraphrased the FFT spec (claimed `fft_size=2048` next-pow2; madmom's actual default is `fft_size=frame_size=1411` with `include_nyquist=False`). This is the second time in a row (D-075 trimmed-mean IOI fix was the first) that paraphrased-from-prose specs landed code that diverged silently from the reference. The Beat This! port adds a per-stage golden-test gate at every pipeline boundary (Session 2 preprocessor; Session 4 layer-by-layer numerical match) so any future drift fails fast at the right stage, not three sessions downstream.

## D-078 — Diagnostic hold semantics and prepared-BeatGrid authority (DSP.3.1/3.2)

**2026-05-05.** Establishes two standing conventions for the diagnostic environment and the beat-grid lifecycle.

### Convention 1: Diagnostic hold pins the visual surface, not the planner

`VisualizerEngine.diagnosticPresetLocked` suppresses `LiveAdaptation.presetOverride` (the mood-derived preset switch emitted by `DefaultLiveAdapter`) but has no effect on:

- `livePlan` — the planned session remains loaded and continues to evolve via structural-boundary rescheduling (`updatedTransition`).
- `mirPipeline.liveDriftTracker` — beat tracking and lock state continue accumulating.
- `SpectralHistoryBuffer` — all slots including session_mode [2420] continue updating.
- `applyPresetByID(_:)` / `nextPreset()` / `previousPreset()` — manual surface controls always work.

The hold strips `presetOverride` from `LiveAdaptation` before it patches `livePlan`, so the plan itself is not dirtied. Structural-boundary rescheduling (`updatedTransition`) is never suppressed — planned end times of upcoming tracks can still shift in response to detected section boundaries.

**Motivation:** A diagnostic observer needs the engine to stay on Spectral Cartograph long enough to confirm the beat-lock transition. Without the hold, `DefaultLiveAdapter` evicts Spectral Cartograph within ~60 seconds because its orchestrator score is 0.0 (`is_diagnostic: true` excludes it from scoring). The hold prevents that eviction without disturbing any state the observer is trying to measure.

**Rule:** Diagnostic hold is a display-layer suppression, not a session-state freeze. Never implement it by pausing the planner, the drift tracker, or the MIR pipeline. Hold means "don't switch away from what I'm looking at"; not "pause everything else."

### Convention 2: Prepared BeatGrid is authoritative; reactive beat tracking is fallback only

When `mirPipeline.liveDriftTracker.hasGrid == true`, `MIRPipeline.buildFeatureVector` drives `beatPhase01` and `beatsUntilNext` from the cached grid plus live drift estimate. `BeatPredictor` is bypassed on the grid path and runs only when `hasGrid == false`.

The grid is installed early: `_buildPlan(seed:)` calls `resetStemPipeline(for: plan.tracks.first?.track)` immediately after `livePlan` is stored, before the user presses play. The drift tracker is loaded and ready to match onsets from the very first beat of the session.

**Motivation:** Before DSP.3.2, the BeatGrid was only installed on the first track-change event (after the first audio callback). In the `.ready → .playing` window, `hasGrid` was false and Spectral Cartograph showed `○ REACTIVE` even for a fully-prepared Spotify session — visually indistinguishable from a truly reactive ad-hoc session. The pre-fire call closes that window.

**Rule:** Any code path that calls `_buildPlan()` should ensure `resetStemPipeline(for:)` fires for the first track when a BeatGrid is available. `extendPlan()` and `regeneratePlan()` both delegate to `_buildPlan()` and are already covered. The `is_diagnostic` flag on `SpectralCartograph.json` causes the orchestrator scorer to return 0.0, preventing auto-selection while keeping the preset reachable via manual controls.

**Implementation:** Commit `56359c07`. Audit context: `docs/diagnostics/DSP.3-beat-sync-test-environment-audit.md`.

## D-079 — Sample rate is captured once per tap install; literal `44100` is a CI-banned constant (Phase QR.1)

**2026-05-06.** Closes the recurrence of Failed Approach #29 (the *Audio MIDI Setup* layer) at the *code* layer — Failed Approach #52. The 2026-05-06 multi-agent codebase review (Architect H1; Audio+DSP D1, D3, A2, B1; ML #1+#2) traced five live-tap consumers in `UzumeApp` that hardcoded `sampleRate: 44100` regardless of the actual Core Audio tap rate. On a 48 kHz tap (the macOS Audio MIDI Setup default) every site silently produced wrong-rate data: stems were 8.8 % time-stretched and pitch-shifted before separation, biasing every downstream stem-feature analysis the orchestrator scores against. Compounding the rate plumbing, `tapSampleRate` was mutated from the audio thread without a synchronization barrier — cross-core visibility for an unsynchronized 8-byte field is not guaranteed on Apple Silicon, producing wrong-tempo grids ~1-in-1000 sessions invisible in tests.

### Rules

1. **`tapSampleRate` is captured once per tap install and read through a synchronization barrier.** `VisualizerEngine.tapSampleRate` is now backed by `_tapSampleRate` under `tapSampleRateLock` (NSLock). The audio callback writes via `updateTapSampleRate(_:)`; consumers on `stemQueue` and `analysisQueue` read via the lock-guarded property. The value is stable for the lifetime of a tap install; on capture-mode switching the new tap's first callback writes the new rate. (Architect H1.)
2. **Literal `44100` is banned outside an explicit allowlist.** Allowlisted call sites are: `StemSeparator.modelSampleRate` (the model's native 44100 Hz output rate), `BeatThisPreprocessor.sourceSampleRate` (Beat This! native 22050 Hz, allowlist also covers the Beat This! source rate), procedural-audio fixture generators in `Diagnostics/SoakTestHarness+AudioGen.swift`, default-argument boilerplate in `StemSampleBuffer` / `StemAnalyzer` / `PitchTracker` (production callers always pass an explicit value; defaults exist only so tests / fixture code can instantiate without threading a rate through), and the test target's fixture audio. Every other occurrence is a regression. `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` runs in CI and fails loud on any non-allowlisted hit.
3. **`StemSampleBuffer` must use the rate-aware overload at every consumer.** The buffer's stored init rate (44100 Hz) sizes capacity conservatively; the *retrieval* size depends on the actual tap rate. `snapshotLatest(seconds:sampleRate:)` and `rms(seconds:sampleRate:)` are the canonical APIs; the no-rate overloads route through them at the buffer's stored rate (legacy behaviour preserved for tests). The five live-tap consumers in `UzumeApp` thread `tapSampleRate` through every call.
4. **Octave correction is halving-only across the entire tempo path.** `BeatDetector+Tempo.computeRobustBPM` and `BeatDetector+Tempo.estimateTempo` previously contained `if bpm < 80 { bpm *= 2 }` branches that doubled any sub-80 estimate to 150. This contradicts `BeatGrid.halvingOctaveCorrected` (halving-only by design — Pyramid Song genuinely runs at ~68 BPM and any track in [40, 80) BPM must survive). Both branches deleted; halving (`if bpm > 160 { bpm /= 2 }`) preserved. (Audio+DSP A2.)
5. **`MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` is `Double`-precision.** A long-session `+= deltaTime` accumulator at Float precision reaches ULP ≈ 240 µs at 30 minutes — smaller than the ±30 ms tight-match window in `LiveBeatDriftTracker` but a guaranteed monotonic drift over hours of listening. `elapsedSeconds` (and the related `lastOnsetRateTime` / `lastRecordTime` accumulators) now store as `Double`; consumers cast to `Float` once at the FeatureVector / CSV write site. `LiveBeatDriftTracker.update(playbackTime:)` parameter widened to `Double` to keep the precision through onset matching and lock-state computation. (Audio+DSP D3.)
6. **`KineticSculpture.metal` drives mercury-melt sminK from deviation primitives.** Pre-QR.1 `f.sub_bass * 0.28 + f.bass * 0.10` thresholded raw AGC-normalized energy with an unset / unreliable sub-band (`f.sub_bass` is rarely set in fixtures or in real tracks where bass is wide-band) weighted with an arbitrary 2.8× factor. Replaced with a continuous-energy baseline plus deviation accent: `0.06 + f.bass * 0.16 + f.bass_dev * 0.05`. The bass term is Layer 1 of the audio data hierarchy (continuous, primary visual driver); the deviation term is the per-onset accent and stays within the "beat ≤ 2× continuous" rule enforced by `PresetAcceptanceTests`. (Audio+DSP B1.)

### Coverage gap (acknowledged)

The actual `tapSampleRate` capture path runs in `VisualizerEngine`, which cannot be instantiated in SPM tests (Metal + audio tap dependency). `Tests/.../Integration/TapSampleRateRegressionTests.swift` covers the load-bearing structural path — the rate-aware `StemSampleBuffer` API the app threads through — and prevents the most common regression mode (silent reversion to 44100 in the buffer/RMS path). App-target coverage is a follow-up; the lint gate plus structural tests are the standing defence.

### Capture-mode rate change (deferred)

If a capture-mode switch (CaptureModeSwitchCoordinator) re-installs the tap with a different rate, the `_tapSampleRate` field updates on the next audio callback under lock — readers see the new rate within one frame. Dependent buffers (`StemSampleBuffer`, `StemAnalyzer`) keep their original sizing, which is conservative (44100 init covers up to 13.78 s on a 48 kHz tap; every consumer requests ≤ 10 s). A tear-down and re-init on rate change is technically cleaner but the cascading orchestrator effects are out-of-scope for this increment; revisit if real-world capture-mode switches expose problems.

### Failed Approaches (D-079)

- **#29 (recurrence at the code layer): hardcoded `44100` consumed live tap audio.** Five sites identified; all fixed in this increment.
- **#52: literal `44100` regression in tap-consuming code paths.** Now CI-gated. Default-argument boilerplate retained on the explicit allowlist (`StemSampleBuffer`, `StemAnalyzer`, `PitchTracker`) for test ergonomics; production wiring overrides every default.

## D-080 — Stem-affinity scoring uses deviation primitives + mean formula (Phase QR.2)

**2026-05-06.** Closes Failed Approaches #53 (AGC-saturated stem-affinity clamped sum) and #54 (reactive `TrackProfile.empty` adversarial penalty). The 2026-05-06 multi-agent codebase review (Orchestrator O1) showed `DefaultPresetScorer.stemAffinitySubScore` accumulated raw AGC-normalized energies across declared affinities and clamped to [0,1]. Because AGC centers each energy field at ~0.5, any preset declaring 2+ stems saturated at ~1.0 on almost all music — the 25% stem-affinity weight did no differentiation work. The same review showed `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator` constructed scoring contexts with `TrackProfile.empty.stemEnergyBalance == StemFeatures.zero`, causing presets with declared affinities to score 0 in stem affinity (zero-balance → devSum = 0) while neutral presets scored 0.5 — the most musically-engaged catalog members were the most penalized in reactive mode.

### Rules

1. **`stemAffinitySubScore` uses deviation primitives (MV-1, D-026) and mean formula.** Score = `mean(max(0, stemEnergyDev[stem]))` over declared affinities, clamped [0, 1]. Dev fields are already on `StemFeatures` floats 17–24. This formula produces score > 0.5 only during genuinely above-average stem transients, making stem affinity a true tiebreaker rather than an always-on bonus or always-on penalty.

2. **Zero-balance guard: `StemFeatures.zero` returns neutral 0.5.** When `stemEnergyBalance == .zero` (EMA not yet converged — typically the first 10 s of live play, or pre-analyzed sessions where devs are near zero), return 0.5 for all presets. This prevents the adversarial penalty: stem-affinity presets are never scored *below* neutral during the unconverged phase.

3. **`DefaultLiveAdapter` has a 30 s per-track mood-override cooldown.** `DefaultLiveAdapter` is now a `final class @unchecked Sendable` (not a struct) with `NSLock`-guarded `lastOverrideTimePerTrack: [TrackIdentity: TimeInterval]`. The first override on any track fires immediately; subsequent overrides within 30 s of the last are suppressed with a `moodDivergenceDetected` event. The cooldown resets on track change (new key in the dictionary).

4. **`minBoundaryScoreGap = 0.05`: boundary-only switch gate tightened.** `DefaultReactiveOrchestrator.compareAndDecide` previously allowed a boundary to trigger a switch when `confidence >= 0.5` regardless of score gap. New gate: `confidence >= 0.5 && scoreGap > minBoundaryScoreGap(0.05)`. Prevents switches when the current preset is already the best option.

5. **`cutEnergyThreshold` raised from 0.7 → 0.85.** Reserves hard-cut transitions for true climax moments (arousal-derived energy > 0.85).

6. **`recentHistory` capped at 50 entries.** `DefaultSessionPlanner` trims the history deque after append; prevents unbounded memory growth in long sessions.

7. **Live `StemFeatures` wired into reactive mode after 10 s.** `VisualizerEngine.applyReactiveUpdate()` passes `pipeline.currentStemFeatures()` as `liveStemFeatures` once `elapsed >= 10.0 s`. Before 10 s the zero-balance guard returns neutral 0.5 for all presets; after 10 s real dev values differentiate stem-affinity presets from neutral presets.

### Consequence for planned sessions

Pre-analyzed `TrackProfile.stemEnergyBalance` is populated from `StemFeatures` snapshots whose EMA has converged over the 30-second preview — dev fields are near zero. This means stem affinity is neutral (0.5) for all presets in planned-session scoring. The 25% weight is now shared equally, and mood + section + tempo dominate planned-session selection. Golden session sequences updated accordingly in `GoldenSessionTests.swift`.

### Implementation

`Sources/Orchestrator/PresetScorer.swift`: `stemAffinitySubScore` + `stemEnergyDeviation` helper. `Sources/Orchestrator/LiveAdapter.swift`: struct → class, `cooldownLock` + `lastOverrideTimePerTrack`. `Sources/Orchestrator/ReactiveOrchestrator.swift`: `minBoundaryScoreGap`, `liveStemFeatures` protocol parameter. `Sources/Orchestrator/TransitionPolicy.swift`: `cutEnergyThreshold` 0.7 → 0.85. `Sources/Orchestrator/SessionPlanner+Segments.swift`: history trim. `UzumeApp/VisualizerEngine+Orchestrator.swift`: live stem wiring. Tests: `StemAffinityScoringTests.swift` (5 new), `LiveAdapterTests.swift` (+3 cooldown tests), `GoldenSessionTests.swift` (sequences regenerated), `PresetScorerTests.swift` (assertion updated).

## D-092 — V.7.7B Arachne staged WORLD + WEB port (filed 2026-05-07)

**Context.** V.7.7A migrated Arachne onto the V.ENGINE.1 staged-composition scaffold but shipped placeholder fragments (vertical gradient + 12-spoke + concentric-ring overlay) and silently dropped the binding for the per-preset fragment buffers (`ArachneWebGPU` at slot 6, `ArachneSpiderGPU` at slot 7) that the legacy mv_warp / direct paths relied on. The V.7.7-redo six-layer `drawWorld()` and the V.7.8 chord-segment `arachneEvalWeb()` survived in the source file as dead reference code attached to the retired `arachne_fragment`. V.7.7B's job was a mechanical port — promote the dead code into the dispatched path; do not write new shader content.

**Decision 1: bind `directPresetFragmentBuffer` / `…Buffer2` at slots 6 / 7 in the staged dispatch.** `RenderPipeline+Staged.encodeStage` now consults the same `directPresetFragmentBufferLock`-guarded fields the legacy `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.drawWithMVWarp` consults (`UzumeEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift:350`). Bound per-frame uniformly across every stage of a staged preset — both WORLD and COMPOSITE see the same `ArachneState` snapshot, so any sampling decision in COMPOSITE is consistent with what WORLD rendered. The harness mirror (`PresetVisualReviewTests.encodeStagePass`) accepts an optional `arachneState:` parameter and binds the same slots when non-nil; "Staged Sandbox" passes nil. Engine `encodeStage` was promoted from `private` to `internal` solely as a test seam (`StagedPresetBufferBindingTests` drives it directly without an `MTKView`).

**Why slot 6/7 instead of new slots.** Reusing the existing setter API (`setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer`, `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer2`) lets the same `ArachneState` allocation flow through every dispatch path the engine supports — mv_warp, direct, and now staged. New per-preset buffers must use slots ≥ 8 (or extend `RenderPipeline` with `directPresetFragmentBuffer3` / `4`); never overload 6 / 7 for a different purpose. CLAUDE.md §GPU Contract Details / Buffer Binding Layout reserves them.

**Decision 2: reuse `drawWorld()` and `arachneEvalWeb()` as free functions across legacy + staged paths rather than fork them.** Both were already free `static` functions in `Arachne.metal`; the staged WORLD and COMPOSITE fragments call into them as-is. No edits to either. Forking would have doubled the maintenance surface for any future tuning (silk material polish, drop refraction, gravity sag). The free-function shape costs nothing — Metal inlines them at compile time.

**Decision 3: delete the legacy `arachne_fragment` (and the V.7.7A placeholder fragments) after the port.** The legacy fragment body becomes the new `arachne_composite_fragment` with two changes only: (a) signature replaces `[[buffer(1)]] fft` + `[[buffer(2)]] wave` with `texture2d<float, access::sample> worldTex [[texture(13)]]` (those FFT / waveform buffers were accepted but never read in the legacy fragment); (b) `bgColor = drawWorld(uv, moodRow, moodRow.z)` becomes `bgColor = worldTex.sample(arachne_world_sampler, uv).rgb` so COMPOSITE samples the WORLD stage's offscreen output instead of recomputing the forest inline. Every other line is byte-identical to the retired fragment — the V.7.5 v5 web walk + drop accumulator + spider silhouette + mist + dust motes blocks pass through unchanged. Net file shrink: 962 → 898 LOC. (The prompt estimated 480; the estimate assumed completely fresh hand-written staged fragments rather than mechanical lift, and the COMPOSITE body is unavoidably ~240 lines because the V.7.5 anchor + pool web walk + drop material + spider + post-process layers are all real.)

**Decision 4: app-layer `case .staged:` allocates `ArachneState` and wires the slot-6/7 buffers.** The prompt's STOP CONDITION #2 anticipated this — V.7.7A's migration removed the `desc.name == "Arachne"` block from the staged branch in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.applyPreset`, so the engine binding fix alone would have read silently-zero buffers at runtime. The block now mirrors the mv_warp branch above it: `ArachneState(device: context.device)` → `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer(state.webBuffer)` (slot 6) → `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer2(state.spiderBuffer)` (slot 7) → `setMeshPresetTick { … state.tick(...) }`. The shared cleanup at the top of `applyPreset` already nils `arachneState` and detaches both buffers, so preset switches stay clean.

**Why the prompt's spec was an under-spec.** The prompt's SCOPE listed the four sub-items inside `Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+Staged.swift`, the harness, and `Arachne.metal`, but did not call out the `case .staged:` app-layer change — the prompt's STOP CONDITION #2 documented the scenario as a contingent diagnosis ("If the buffer is unbound, … V.7.7A may have stopped calling `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer()` for staged presets"). It had stopped, so the wiring landed alongside the shader port in Commit 2 to keep the runtime functional from the moment the new fragments shipped.

**Failed Approach motivation.** Failed Approach #49 ("constant-tuning on a renderer structurally missing compositing layers") is the architectural reason V.7.7A → V.7.7B exists: V.7.5 spent six commits tweaking constants on a 2D fragment that lacked the references' compositing layers; the staged scaffold *is* the unwound version, and V.7.7B is the mechanical step that drops the V.7.5 v5 visual baseline back onto it. Future tuning (refractive drops, biology-correct build) lands on the staged scaffold in V.7.7C / V.7.7D, not by re-working the legacy fragment.

**Verification.** `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter "StagedComposition|StagedPresetBufferBinding|PresetRegression|ArachneSpiderRender|ArachneState"` — 5 suites green. `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter "renderStagedPresetPerStage"` — Arachne WORLD + COMPOSITE PNGs land at non-placeholder size (377 KB / 1.16 MB). `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp -destination 'platform=macOS' build` — clean. `swiftlint lint --strict` — 0 violations on touched files. Golden hashes regenerated: Arachne `0xC6168E8F87868C80` across all three fixtures (regression renders COMPOSITE with `worldTex` unbound → foreground over zero backdrop), Spider forced `0x461E3E1F07870C00`, "Staged Sandbox" added at `0x000022160A162A00`. Pre-existing `ProgressiveReadinessTests` flakes under full-suite parallel @MainActor load (already documented in CLAUDE.md) trip independently of this increment.

**Files changed (commit 1 — engine + harness binding):**
- `UzumeEngine/Sources/Renderer/RenderPipeline+Staged.swift` — `encodeStage` reads slots 6/7; visibility `private` → `internal` (test seam).
- `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Renderer/PresetVisualReviewTests.swift` — `encodeStagePass` + `renderStagedFrame` accept optional `ArachneState`; `renderStagedPresetPerStage` constructs warmed state for Arachne.
- `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Renderer/StagedPresetBufferBindingTests.swift` (new) — synthetic shader sentinel test, slot 6 + slot 7.

**Files changed (commit 2 — shader port + app wiring + golden hashes):**
- `UzumeEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Arachne.metal` — `arachne_world_fragment` + `arachne_composite_fragment` ported; legacy `arachne_fragment` and V.7.7A placeholder block deleted; 962 → 898 LOC.
- `UzumeApp/VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` — `case .staged:` allocates `ArachneState` and binds slots 6/7 + tick (mirrors mv_warp branch).
- `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Renderer/PresetRegressionTests.swift` — Arachne hash + "Staged Sandbox" hash regenerated.
- `UzumeEngine/Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Presets/ArachneSpiderRenderTests.swift` — spider forced hash regenerated, comment updated.

## D-097 — Particle preset architecture: siblings, not subclasses (Increment DM.0, filed 2026-05-08)

**Status:** Accepted 2026-05-08.

**Context.** Drift Motes (DM.1) was scoped against the assumption that Murmuration's `Particles.metal` + `ProceduralGeometry` constituted reusable particle infrastructure for the `["feedback", "particles"]` pass set. Implementation discovered they're a single-tenant Murmuration implementation: `ProceduralGeometry` looks up the `particle_update` / `particle_vertex` / `particle_fragment` MSL functions by name (no per-preset override mechanism); `VisualizerEngine.makeParticleGeometry` constructs a single instance with Murmuration-tuned config (5000 particles, decay rate 0, drag 0.8); `Particles.metal`'s fragment shader hardcodes the bird-silhouette colour `(0.02, 0.02, 0.03)`. Plugging Drift Motes into this dispatch would render Murmuration's flock kernel over Drift Motes' sky backdrop — the literal Failed Approach #1 ("Murmuration v2") called out in `DRIFT_MOTES_DESIGN.md §6`.

**Two paths considered.**

(a) **Parameterized common pipeline.** Extend `ProceduralGeometry` to accept per-preset kernel names and a richer `ParticleConfiguration` (kernel-name, vertex-name, fragment-name, recycle bounds, emission rules, hue-baking strategy, decay semantics, drag, …). Murmuration and Drift Motes would both flow through this single class.

(b) **Sibling conformers via protocol.** Introduce a minimal `ParticleGeometry` protocol (compute dispatch, render dispatch, governor gate). `ProceduralGeometry` conforms without behavior change. Drift Motes ships its own conformer in DM.1; future particle presets do the same. The render pipeline schedules dispatch through the protocol; preset-specific concerns (kernel names, particle count, sprite shape, hue-baking, recycle bounds) live inside each conformer.

**Decision: (b).** Murmuration and Drift Motes are different enough that parameterizing one pipeline to host both bloats the configuration interface with a union of disjoint concepts — Murmuration's homePos generation, decay-rate-0 persistence, drum-driven turning waves vs. Drift Motes' recycle bounds, emission position derivation, per-emission hue baking from `vocalsPitchHz`. Future particle presets (snowfall, sparks, rain, wave spray, dust storms — each plausible) would each add another disjoint concern, producing a configuration interface that no single preset uses fully and every preset has to defend itself against. Protocol-based conformance lets each preset express itself cleanly while sharing only what genuinely is shared (the `Particle` struct memory layout — 64 bytes, `packed_float4 color` — and the buffer-then-dispatch convention).

**What was rejected: parameterized common pipeline.** The configuration surface required to express both Murmuration and Drift Motes is large and would only grow with future particle presets. "Siblings, not subclasses" generalizes correctly; parameterized common pipeline does not. Subclassing-style parameterization also forces shared lifecycle assumptions (single instance, app-lifetime persistence, per-preset reset semantics) that are accidental to Murmuration today and may not hold for future presets — better to leave each conformer to manage its own lifecycle.

**Surface.** `ParticleGeometry` is `AnyObject, Sendable` with three members: `update(features:stemFeatures:commandBuffer:)` for the per-frame compute dispatch, `render(encoder:features:)` for the per-frame render dispatch, and `activeParticleFraction: Float { get set }` for the D-057 frame-budget governor gate. The protocol does not expose buffer or pipeline state — encapsulation is the point; the engine schedules through methods, not buffer access. The protocol is not generic over particle type (the `Particle` struct is fixed and shared across all conformers).

**Engine wiring.** `RenderPipeline.particleGeometry` is `(any ParticleGeometry)?`. `RenderPipeline.setParticleGeometry(_:)` accepts any conformer. `FeedbackDrawContext.particles`, `drawDirect(...)` and `drawParticleMode(...)` parameter types are widened identically. `VisualizerEngine.makeParticleGeometry` returns `(any ParticleGeometry)?`. The dispatch sites (`particles?.update(...)`, `particles?.render(...)`, `particleGeometry?.activeParticleFraction = ...`) are byte-identical; only the static type changes. Murmuration is the only conformer at end of DM.0.

**Verification.** `PresetRegressionTests` passes with all 14 presets × 3 fixtures green — Murmuration's dHash is bit-identical pre- and post-DM.0. `xcodebuild -scheme UzumeApp build` succeeds. Engine sources contain zero remaining `ProceduralGeometry` concrete-type references outside `Geometry/ProceduralGeometry.swift` and doc-comments (verified by `grep -rn ProceduralGeometry UzumeEngine/Sources/`). `Particles.metal` and the `Particle` struct memory layout are byte-identical across the increment.

**What DM.1 picks up.** Drift Motes ships a `DriftMotesGeometry: ParticleGeometry` conformer with its own particle buffer, `motes_update` compute kernel, `motes_vertex` / `motes_fragment` render functions, recycle-bounds + emission-position derivation, and (in Session 2) per-particle hue baking from `vocalsPitchHz`. `VisualizerEngine.makeParticleGeometry` gains a Drift Motes branch alongside the existing Murmuration branch — a small, focused factory addition rather than a parameterization of shared infrastructure.

## D-099 — Engine MSL `FeatureVector` / `StemFeatures` extended to match preset preamble (Increment DM.2, filed 2026-05-08)

**Decision.** `UzumeEngine/Sources/Renderer/Shaders/Common.metal` now declares `FeatureVector` at 192 bytes / 48 floats and `StemFeatures` at 256 bytes / 64 floats — byte-identical to the layouts in `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift`. Pre-DM.2, both engine MSL structs were stuck at the pre-MV-1 / pre-MV-3 sizes (32 floats / 128 bytes and 16 floats / 64 bytes respectively), even though the Swift sources of truth (`AudioFeatures+Analyzed.swift` and `StemFeatures.swift`) had been at the larger sizes since MV-1 / MV-3.

**Context.** DM.2 Task 1 specifies that `motes_update` (engine library) reads `f.mid_att_rel` (FV float 32 = byte offset 128) for the cold-stems hue-shift fallback and `stems.vocals_pitch_hz` / `stems.vocals_pitch_confidence` (StemFeatures floats 41–42 = byte offset 160–164) for the warm-stems pitch hue. With the pre-DM.2 engine MSL layouts, neither field was readable — the kernel could only see the first 32 / 16 floats. The Swift binding always uploads the full `MemoryLayout<…>.stride` (192 / 256 bytes) so the trailing fields were on the device but unreachable from the engine kernels.

**Two paths considered.**

(a) **Extend the engine MSL struct definitions to match the preset preamble.** Pure additive change — first 32 / 16 floats keep their original offsets, new fields appear after. Murmuration's `particle_update`, MVWarp's vertex/fragment, and `feedback_warp_fragment` all read only fields in the original tail, so their byte access is unchanged.

(b) **Pass `mid_att_rel` and `vocals_pitch_hz` through `DriftMotesConfig` (buffer 4) as Swift-prepared floats.** Avoids touching `Common.metal` but conflates "kernel tuning constants" (the existing `DriftMotesConfig` content) with "per-frame audio drivers" (a categorically different concern), and requires the Swift side to reach into `latestFeatures` / `latestStems` to denormalise the per-frame values.

**Decision: (a).** The engine MSL has been a layout liar since MV-1 / MV-3 landed — every engine-library shader was working from a smaller view of the same buffer than presets see. Correcting it is a one-time additive change that preserves byte-identical reads for every existing consumer (verified by golden-hash regression: Murmuration's `0x07449B6727773FF8`/`0x0B449A4727373FF8`/`0x0744936727773FF8` and every other preset's hashes are unchanged). Path (b) would have wedged the audio-coupling concern into a config buffer that exists for kernel tuning constants, and would have had to be reverted later when DM.3's drum dispersion shock wants to read `stems.drums_beat` / `stems.drums_energy_dev` from the same kernel.

**What was rejected.** Adding a third "audio passthrough" buffer slot for engine kernels — would have created a third copy of the same data already in buffers 1 and 3, and added a Swift-side denormalisation step every frame.

**Murmuration invariant preserved.** All 15 preset golden hashes regenerated identically to the post-DM.1 baseline (`UPDATE_GOLDEN_SNAPSHOTS=1` run produced byte-identical output for every preset other than Drift Motes). `Particles.metal`, `ProceduralGeometry.swift`, `ParticleGeometry.swift`, and `RenderPipeline*.swift` are byte-identical to their post-DM.1 state — Common.metal is not in the prompt's "byte-identical to DM.1" invariant list, and the change is purely a struct-extension correction.

**Carry-forward.** Engine library shaders can now read the full FV / StemFeatures surface. DM.3 will use this for emission-rate scaling (`f.mid_att_rel`) and drum dispersion shock (`stems.drums_beat`, `stems.drums_energy_dev`) without further struct edits. Future `Particles*` engine kernels also benefit — MV-1 deviation primitives, MV-3a per-stem rich metadata, and MV-3b beat phase are now in scope.

**Note:** V.7.7C.5 (WORLD-reframe) reserved D-099 in spec text with an "or next-available ID" escape clause. DM.2 filed first; V.7.7C.5 lands as D-100.

## D-101 — `stems.drums_beat` as the canonical particles-family beat reactivity field (Increment DM.3, filed 2026-05-08)

**Decision.** Particles-family presets that need a per-frame "beat just hit" signal route to `stems.drums_beat` (the BeatDetector envelope on the drums stem, gated by `smoothstep(0.30, 0.70, stems.drums_beat)` for clean event detection) rather than `stems.drums_energy_dev` (the AGC-deviation primitive). `stems.drums_energy_dev` remains available for continuous proportional accents — when "more drums than the AGC running average" is the right semantic — but the canonical event field for kick-driven impulses is `drums_beat`.

**Context.** DM.1's carry-forward block named `stems.drums_energy_dev` as the dispersion-shock driver. DM.2's carry-forward block silently corrected this to `stems.drums_beat` with no explanation. DM.3 ships dispersion shock against `drums_beat` per the corrected guidance. This entry records the rationale so the next particles-family preset doesn't relitigate it.

**Why `drums_beat`, not `drums_energy_dev`.**

- **`drums_beat` is event-shaped.** The BeatDetector emits a triangular envelope rising on onset and decaying over ~200 ms via `pow(0.6813, 30/fps)`. Smoothstepping against (0.30, 0.70) gives a clean "this frame is part of a beat impulse" gate that fires for a bounded number of frames per event.
- **`drums_energy_dev` is continuous-shaped.** `(drumsEnergy − EMA) × 2.0` clamped to non-negative reads as "more drums than running average" — useful for sustained percussion intensity (e.g. a hi-hat-heavy section) but not for picking out individual kicks. Smoothstepping against it produces a duty-cycle proportional to onset density, not a pulse per onset.
- **VolumetricLithograph precedent (D-026 Note).** `smoothstep(0.30, 0.70, stems.drums_beat)` is already the canonical gate for "drum onset accent" in `VolumetricLithograph.metal`. The dispersion shock in `motes_update` reuses the exact same form for the same semantic.
- **Absolute-threshold smoothstep is D-026-allowed on stem onset signals.** D-026 targets *FeatureVector raw bands* (`f.bass`, `f.mid`, `f.treb`) where AGC normalisation makes absolute thresholds non-portable across tracks and within-track sections. `stems.drums_beat` is post-onset-detection, post-cooldown, in event coordinates — a 0.30 threshold means "this is in the rising half of the envelope," which is the same musical event regardless of AGC state. The deviation-primitive rule does not extend to envelopes that are already event-coordinate by construction.

**What was rejected.**

- **Reading `stems.drums_beat > some_value` directly** without the smoothstep — works but produces ratchet motion (the impulse magnitude jumps from 0 to gain at threshold, with no rising edge). The smoothstep gives a smoother visual onset that matches the envelope's natural shape.
- **Routing to `f.beat_bass` or `f.beat_composite`** (FV onsets) — these are the pre-stem-separation onset signals and bias toward whatever instrument carries the lowest energy in the kick range. `stems.drums_beat` benefits from the stem separation pass already isolating the drum content. For particles-family presets that have access to `stems`, the stem-isolated signal is the right choice.

**Murmuration relationship.** Murmuration's `particle_update` already reads `stems.drums_beat` via the D-019 stem-warmup blend (`mix(fm_beat, stems.drums_beat, stemBlend)`). DM.3's dispersion shock follows the same route in `motes_update`, but unblended — the dispersion shock fires only when stems are warm enough for the smoothstep gate to trip, so a D-019 blend is redundant (cold stems = `drums_beat = 0` = no dispersion).

**Carry-forward.** Future particles-family presets needing a "kick-driven impulse" should route to `stems.drums_beat` with the canonical `smoothstep(0.30, 0.70, ...)` gate. `stems.drums_energy_dev` remains the right choice for continuous percussion-intensity drivers (e.g. flock-density modulation by sustained percussion).

## D-LM-buffer-slot-8 — Fragment buffer slot 8 reservation for per-preset CPU-driven state (Increment LM.0, filed 2026-05-08)

**Status.** Accepted.

**Decision.** Reserve fragment buffer slot 8 as a third per-preset CPU-driven state buffer, alongside the existing slots 6 and 7. New `RenderPipeline.directPresetFragmentBuffer3` storage + `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(_:)` setter mirror the slot 6 / 7 setter pattern exactly. Bound at fragment slot 8 in every per-frame uniform binding site that already binds slots 6 / 7 (staged composition, mv_warp scene-to-texture) **plus** the direct-pass (`drawDirect`) and the ray-march **lighting** pass (`RayMarchPipeline.runLightingPass`). The G-buffer pass (`RayMarchPipeline.runGBufferPass`) intentionally does NOT bind slot 8 — only lighting consumes it today.

**Context.** Phase LM (Lumen Mosaic) is the first preset to need a third per-preset state buffer beyond what slots 6 (`ArachneState.webBuffer` / `GossamerState.wavePool`) and 7 (`ArachneState.spiderBuffer`) already reserve. Lumen Mosaic's planned `LumenPatternState` (336 B — 4 light agents + 4 patterns + small scalars per `Lumen_Mosaic_Rendering_Architecture_Contract.md` §"Required uniforms / buffers") encodes per-frame CPU-driven state that the fragment shader reads to compute analytic backlight emission per Voronoi cell. The rendering contract calls out slot 8 explicitly (Decision F.1: "Bind at slot 8 in the same per-frame uniform contract as slots 6 and 7").

LM.0 is pure infrastructure; no shader code lands in this increment. The slot is wired so LM.1 (the first Lumen Mosaic shader) can bind state via the new setter and the lighting fragment can read `LumenPatternState` directly.

**Why slot 8, not a different mechanism.**

- **Mirrors the slot 6 / 7 contract.** Slots 6 and 7 are already the documented "per-preset fragment buffer #1 / #2" reservations (CLAUDE.md GPU Contract). Adding slot 8 as "per-preset fragment buffer #3" extends the same idiom with no new abstraction. Future authors who already know how to use slot 6 / 7 immediately know how to use slot 8.
- **Shared resource, first consumer is Lumen Mosaic.** The slot is not Lumen-Mosaic-specific. Any future preset that needs a third per-frame state buffer binds via `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3`. Lumen Mosaic is the first consumer because it is the first preset to outgrow slots 6 / 7.
- **No struct extensions to `Common.metal`.** Extending `FeatureVector` or `StemFeatures` to carry the new state would force a byte-layout migration (cf. D-099) and pay a regression cost on every preset's golden hash. A dedicated slot is cheaper and additive.
- **Per-frame uniform binding contract is uniform across stages.** Same rule as slots 6 / 7: in staged-composition presets, slot 8 is bound at every stage of the staged dispatch (WORLD, COMPOSITE, etc.) — both stages see the same snapshot. This avoids state divergence across stages.

**Why the G-buffer pass is excluded from slot 8 binding.**

Lumen Mosaic's pattern state is consumed by the lighting fragment (per Decision F.1: emission-dominated path with Option α — lighting pass multiplies albedo by emission gain when matID == 1). The G-buffer pass writes albedo / depth / normal / matID and does not need the pattern state. Excluding the G-buffer pass keeps that pass's binding surface stable and minimises the chance of slot 8 leaking into shaders that don't need it. If a future preset turns out to need slot 8 in the G-buffer pass, that is an additive change to `RayMarchPipeline+Passes.swift`'s `runGBufferPass` (and a follow-up entry to this decision).

**What was rejected.**

- **Extending `FeatureVector` or `StemFeatures` with the new fields.** Forces a byte-layout migration (cf. D-099) and regenerates every preset's golden hash. A dedicated slot is cheaper and additive.
- **A new G-buffer channel for emission state.** Per the rendering contract (§sceneSDF/sceneMaterial Option β), this is heavier infrastructure work and unnecessary while Option α (matID == 1 emission gain) holds.
- **Binding at a higher slot index (e.g. 16+) to leave headroom.** Slot 8 is the next contiguous slot after 6 / 7 and pre-noise textures (4–8). The TextureManager binds noise *textures* at slots 4–8, not buffers — Metal's buffer and texture argument-binding spaces are independent. Slot 8 in the buffer space is free.
- **Making slot 8 ray-march-only.** The prompt initially considered this fallback. Mirroring the slot 6 / 7 contract (staged + mv_warp + direct + ray-march lighting) keeps a future direct-pass-only preset that needs a third state buffer eligible without further engine changes.

**Rule.** Future presets that need a third per-frame state buffer bind via `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer3(_:)` and read at fragment slot 8. **Do not** overload slots 6 / 7 / 8 for a different purpose; if a fourth state buffer becomes necessary, extend `RenderPipeline` with `directPresetFragmentBuffer4` / `5` and document the slot in CLAUDE.md GPU Contract. The G-buffer pass binding remains stable; only the lighting pass plus the staged / mv_warp / direct paths bind slot 8.

**Carry-forward.** LM.1 implements `LumenPatternEngine` (CPU-side state + setter call) + `LumenMosaic.metal` (lighting fragment reads `LumenPatternState` at `[[buffer(8)]]`). No further engine changes expected for Lumen Mosaic; if LM.5 promotes silhouette occluder masks per Decision B.2 they ride the same slot or a future slot 9 — to be filed at LM.5 if needed.

> **Phase MD bloc (D-103 → D-122) — REVISIT banner (planned at DOC.0 2026-05-13, landed at DOC.4 2026-06-11).**
> Twenty strategy decisions filed in one day (2026-05-12) without empirical input from the work they govern; ten were amended same-day, D-120 was reverted within 24 h (now in `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md`; lessons = CLAUDE.md Failed Approaches #59/#60). Since filing, the empirical evidence the bloc lacked has arrived: Dragon Bloom (D-137/D-138) and Fata Morgana (D-139) shipped + certified as faithful-port uplifts, and four Uzume-original presets certified (Nimbus, Murmuration, Skein, Ferrofluid Ocean). Treat each D-1xx entry below as a forecast pending re-derivation against that evidence; the bloc re-evaluation belongs to the next Phase MD planning session, not to a pruning pass.

*(RB.2-2, 2026-06-11: the unexecuted Phase-MD planning subset — D-103–D-110, D-112, D-115–D-118 — moved to `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md`; the banner below now covers the surviving posture/legal commitments: D-111, D-113, D-114, D-119, D-121, D-122.)*

## D-111 — Phase MD license posture: MIT-derivative with provenance + attribution + takedown (Strategy Decision I, filed 2026-05-12; amended 2026-05-12 to remove counsel-review gating; amended 2026-05-12 — inspired-by reframe revises attribution schema, retires notification protocol)

**Rule.** Transpiled Milkdrop-origin presets ship under Uzume's MIT licence, with provenance metadata + attribution per the following protocol:

1. Each transpiled preset's JSON sidecar carries a `milkdrop_source` block:
   ```json
   "milkdrop_source": {
     "filename": "<original .milk filename>",
     "author": "<author from filename pattern, best-effort>",
     "theme": "<cream-of-crop theme directory>",
     "sha256": "<SHA256 of source .milk file>",
     "pack": "projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop"
   }
   ```
2. `docs/CREDITS.md` carries a "Milkdrop preset attribution" section enumerating every shipped preset's source. Pattern mirrors the existing Open-Unmix HQ and Beat This! ML weight attributions.
3. Uzume commits to honoring takedown requests routed through the projectM team (per the pack's stated takedown path).

**Risk-acceptance (amendment 2026-05-12).** Matt as project lead accepts residual legal risk on the basis of (a) the pack's two-decade public posture and four years as projectM's default with no significant copyright dispute on record, (b) the bounded downside (worst plausible outcome is takedown → preset removed from next release), and (c) Uzume's good-faith provenance + attribution + takedown protocol. **Phase MD work is NOT gated on counsel review.** Counsel review remains available as optional asynchronous due-diligence — the `docs/MILKDROP_COUNSEL_BRIEF.md` artifact stays in tree as the outgoing-communication brief — but is not a precondition for any Phase MD increment. The risk-acceptance is contingent on the scope conditions documented in the brief (no `.milk` file redistribution, no commercialization, no claim of original authorship); a material scope change reopens the question.

**Why.** The cream-of-crop pack's curator (ISOSCELES) asserts public-domain-by-convention with a projectM-managed takedown path. The pack has been the default for projectM releases since 2022 with no significant copyright dispute on record. The CREDITS.md attribution pattern is the natural template (Open-Unmix HQ, Beat This! ML weights already follow it). Counsel review as a *gating* mechanism trades a small additional reduction in residual risk for an unbounded delay to development; the project's posture (per Matt 2026-05-12) is that the residual risk does not warrant the gate.

**Carry-forward.** `docs/CREDITS.md` "Milkdrop preset attribution" section exists as a placeholder; populated when MD.5 ships its first port. Counsel review remains available at Matt's discretion; the brief stays in tree as historical context. **Note: D-111 is one of the decisions slated for substantive revision in the upcoming inspired-by reframe addendum (see `prompts/MD-strategy-addendum-prompt.md`); the addendum may further refine the attribution + provenance schema under the inspired-by framing.**

**Amendment 2026-05-12 (inspired-by reframe — attribution schema renamed; notification protocol retired).** Under the inspired-by reframe (D-113 / `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12), the operative legal framing is "inspired by," not "derivative of." Each Milkdrop-inspired Uzume preset's JSON sidecar carries an `inspired_by` block in place of `milkdrop_source`:

```json
"inspired_by": {
  "milkdrop_filename": "<original .milk filename>",
  "original_artist": "<author from filename pattern, best-effort>",
  "pack": "projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop",
  "sha256": "<SHA256 of source .milk file>"
}
```

The `theme` field is dropped (no longer load-bearing once tier assignment retires per D-103 amendment). `CREDITS.md` section is renamed to "Milkdrop-inspired preset attribution" and populated as inspired-by uplifts ship. The provenance + attribution + takedown protocol (CREDITS.md enumeration + projectM-routed takedown) stays in force as the MIT licence's responsibility-of-the-redistributor posture, contingent on the scope conditions in the brief (no `.milk` redistribution, no commercialization, no claim of original authorship). The **pre-release notification protocol** (notifying original Milkdrop preset authors of each Uzume port before public release) is **retired for the pre-community phase** per D-113 / `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.8 — rationale: until preset development opens to community contributors, all uplifts are authored by Matt + Claude Code, and notification before community-authoring infrastructure exists is a checkbox exercise. Trigger to reopen: when Uzume opens preset development to community contributors. The inspired-by framing materially reduces the substantive-similarity surface compared to a port, but the discipline rule (D-116 / `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6`) is the load-bearing authoring-time constraint that operationalizes the framing.

---

## D-113 — Phase MD posture reframe: inspired-by, not derivative-of (Strategy Addendum, filed 2026-05-12)

**Rule.** The operative legal and creative framing for Phase MD is **"inspired by,"** not "derivative of." Every Milkdrop-influenced Uzume preset is a **new creation** that takes inspiration from a source preset's concept and aesthetic, implemented from scratch on Uzume's primitives. The transpiler / mechanical-port framing committed to under the base strategy (`docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §§1–11) is retired.

The reframe is operative on three axes:

1. **Legal posture.** Uzume asserts externally that its Milkdrop-influenced presets are inspired-by works, not derivatives. The CREDITS.md attribution stays (renamed to "Milkdrop-inspired preset attribution"); the substantial-similarity discipline rule (D-116 / `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6`) becomes the load-bearing authoring-time constraint.
2. **Scale.** Initial planning target widens from ~35 presets (base strategy §5) to **~200 inspired-by uplifts**. At ~2–3 days per preset to certification, this is a multi-year work stream, not a finite phase.
3. **Release model.** Uzume's first release ships at **20 presets** total (D-114).

**Why.** Matt's 2026-05-12 post-sign-off review of the base strategy reframed the work after recognizing that the derivative-port model (a) over-stated Uzume's substantive overlap with source presets (Uzume presets are authored on different primitives — mv_warp + ray_march + V.1–V.4 utilities + MV-3 capabilities — and read as Uzume works that *honor* source concepts, not as Milkdrop ports with a Uzume frontend), (b) created an authoring tax (transpiler authoring + per-preset D-026 audit + tier-stratified rubric application) that did not match the actual per-preset session shape, and (c) limited the catalog ceiling artificially (35 presets cap was a transpiler-budgeting artifact; the inspired-by framing has no such cap).

**Notification protocol — retired for pre-community phase.** The base strategy's I.1 license posture committed to projectM-routed takedown but did not commit to a pre-release notification protocol; iterative discussion had suggested one. Under the inspired-by reframe, **notification protocol is retired** until Uzume opens preset development to community contributors. Rationale: until then, all uplifts are authored by Matt + Claude Code, and notification before community-authoring infrastructure exists is a checkbox exercise. Trigger to reopen: community-contribution rollout (separate phase, separate prompt). See `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.8.

**Carry-forward.** Drives the amendments on D-103 (single tier), D-105 (single `family` value), D-106 (single Settings toggle), D-110 (transpiler retired), D-111 (`inspired_by` schema + notification deferral), D-112 (HLSL-free constraint dissolves). Drives the new decisions D-114 (release model), D-115 (release-bundle composition), D-116 (discipline rule), D-117 (catalog-ratio framing), D-118 (read-only analysis tool scope). See `docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12 for the full addendum.

## D-114 — Phase MD release model: 20-preset first-release bundle (Strategy Addendum, filed 2026-05-12)

**Rule.** Uzume's first public release ships when the production catalog reaches **20 M7-certified presets** (full V.6 rubric, `rubric_profile` matched per preset). The 20 are a mix of Uzume-native + Milkdrop-inspired (composition per D-115). After first release, ongoing uplift batches ship at a cadence to be set by release planning (weekly / monthly / quarterly — separate decision, not in this addendum).

**Why.** 20 is the minimum bundle size at which:

1. A 60–90 minute listening session can rotate presets without repetition fatigue (the Phase 4 family-repeat penalty + 50-preset history window already handle within-bundle rotation, but 20 is the floor that makes the rotation feel varied).
2. Every preset in the bundle can clear M7 review in a feasible work window (with ~14 Uzume-native presets already authored and ~10 inspired-by uplifts targeted, the gap to 20 is bounded).
3. The catalog presents a coherent product, not a tech demo (1 certified preset, Lumen Mosaic alone, is below the product threshold).

**Current state vs threshold (2026-05-12):**

- **Certified (1):** Lumen Mosaic (cert flipped at LM.7, 2026-05-12).
- **Production-but-not-all-certified (~12):** Arachne, Aurora Veil (pending Phase AV), Fractal Tree, Gossamer, Murmuration, Nebula, Plasma, Spectral Cartograph (diagnostic — excluded from auto-selection per D-074), Stalker, Starburst, Volumetric Lithograph, Waveform. Each is one M7 + cert review away from the bundle. (Glass Brutalist retired GBRETIRE.1 / D-186 — its D-020 permanence constraint blocked the instrument-as-hero role. Kinetic Sculpture retired KSRETIRE.1 / D-188 — never found the right direction across multiple redesigns.)
- **Gap to 20:** 6+ presets, source TBD per D-115.

**Carry-forward.** Drives the work-prioritization shape over the next several months: Phase G-uplift (cert reviews on the ~14 production-but-not-certified members) + Phase AV / Phase CC + the first inspired-by uplift batch (initial seed list per D-112 amendment). Post-release cadence decision lives in a future release-planning prompt; D-114 covers only the bundle threshold, not the rhythm after.

## D-119 — Uzume product brand identity: Milkdrop-influenced modern platform (Strategy Addendum follow-up, filed 2026-05-12)

**Rule.** Uzume's product identity is **"Milkdrop-influenced modern platform"** — a music-visualization product whose catalog is intentionally majority-Milkdrop-inspired, drawing on the 25-year Milkdrop preset tradition as Uzume's primary aesthetic well, layered with Uzume's modern capabilities (stems via Open-Unmix HQ, beat phase via Beat This!, ray-march scenes, `mv_warp` per-vertex feedback, PBR materials, MV-3 audio analysis surface). This is the committed product identity going forward.

**Implications.**

1. **Catalog ratio target (D-117 amendment).** Steady-state catalog ratio is **≥ 50% inspired-by, ~60–70% expected, upper bound ~80%** to preserve Uzume-native distinctiveness. The "deferred until ~40 presets" framing of the original D-117 retires.
2. **First-release bundle composition (D-115 amendment).** Default recommendation shifts from balanced 10+10 to inspired-by-forward — new default **7+13** (Uzume-native + Milkdrop-inspired); alternatives 5+15 (bolder) or 10+10 (fallback).
3. **External communication.** When Uzume marketing copy / repo description / about-screen text gets authored, it names Milkdrop influence explicitly — not as background acknowledgement but as the defining aesthetic choice. The CREDITS.md "Milkdrop-inspired preset attribution" section becomes load-bearing user-facing content, not just a legal footnote.
4. **D-107 brand-fit criterion narrows.** "Brand fit" for ray-march-composing inspired-by uplifts (formerly D-107 Hybrid candidate criteria) is no longer about avoiding overlap with Uzume-native catalog members — the catalog is meant to be Milkdrop-forward. Brand fit reduces to "does this register expand the Milkdrop-influenced character of the catalog?" with internal-competition concerns retired.

**Why.** Two alternatives were on the table:

- **"Phosphene-native with Milkdrop accents."** Would have required a hard ceiling on inspired-by share (~25%) and aggressive Phase G-uplift / Phase AV / Phase CC throughput to keep parity. Matches the original §3 strategy's implicit framing.
- **"Milkdrop-influenced modern platform."** Committed brand identity. Matches the actual work distribution — Phase MD is the long-tail catalog-growth engine; Uzume-native phases are the differentiating but slower work stream.

Matt picked the second 2026-05-12 in response to the adversarial review's call for an explicit brand commitment. The pick acknowledges the empirical work distribution and avoids the "catalog accidentally drifts Milkdrop-forward without a brand framing to support it" failure mode the adversarial review flagged.

**Carry-forward.**

- D-115 composition recommendation amended (7+13 default; see D-115 amendment block).
- D-117 catalog-ratio framing amended (target ≥ 50% inspired-by, no longer deferred; see D-117 amendment block).
- Uzume marketing / About / repo-description copy reflects the framing when authored. None of this exists in the repo yet; flagged for the eventual marketing-copy authoring session.
- D-107 brand-fit criterion narrows per the implication above (no separate amendment block — the criterion was authored under the unstated "Uzume-native default" assumption; D-119 surfaces the assumption and inverts it).

## D-121 — Phase MD visual-divergence rule (Strategy Addendum follow-up, filed 2026-05-12; amends D-116 + SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6 bullet 3)

**Rule.** D-116 bullet 3 of the substantial-similarity discipline rule (lives in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6`) is rewritten from permissive ("the visual structure may differ from the source") to load-bearing:

> **"3. The Uzume preset's rendered output MUST differ measurably from the source on at least one of: dominant motion model, palette character, primary feature stack, or compositional structure."**

**M7 review test (mandatory for Milkdrop-inspired presets).** Render the Uzume preset on a shared test track; render the source `.milk` on the same track in projectM (or comparable Milkdrop-compatible renderer); place renders side-by-side. The M7 reviewer (Matt) writes a one-paragraph divergence rationale in the closeout naming **which axis diverges and how**. A preset that cannot articulate a divergence on at least one of the four axes does **not** certify; the remediation is to rewrite under closer discipline, not to tune (Failed Approach #49 precedent — tuning constants on a structurally broken renderer).

**Why.** The original D-116 bullet 3 was permissive ("may differ"), leaving the rendered-output axis unprotected. Bullets 1 / 2 / 4 enforce code-side similarity (no equations copy-pasted, no shader logic ported line-for-line, no `.milk` redistribution); the rendered-output axis is the more legally significant for copyright in software UI and visual works, but had no enforcing rule. The `inspired_by` provenance block + CREDITS.md attribution establish **knowledge of** and **access to** the source preset — both elements of a substantial-similarity case. Without enforced visual divergence, that documentation increases legal exposure relative to silently shipping aesthetically-similar output. The strengthened bullet 3 + the side-by-side M7 test operationalise the visual axis.

Failed Approach #48 is the precedent at the per-preset level (Arachne V.7 rendered output landed at the named anti-reference `10_anti_neon_stylized_glow.jpg` despite passing the §10.1-faithful authoring path; substantive similarity to the anti-reference was caught at M7 review, not at authoring). D-121's enforcement applies the same lesson at the cross-product level: catch the source-similarity case at M7 review by mandatory side-by-side comparison, not by trusting the code-side discipline to produce visual divergence automatically.

**Carry-forward.**

- `SHADER_CRAFT.md §12.6` bullet 3 + M7 checklist rewritten in the same commit as this decision.
- Phase MD per-preset closeout reports for Milkdrop-inspired uplifts include a divergence rationale citing one of the four axes.
- The rule is reusable for any future reference-anchored authoring outside Phase MD where the same anti-reference convergence risk applies (Failed Approach #48 generalisation). For Phase MD specifically the M7 test is mandatory; for other phases it remains author + reviewer discretion.

## D-122 — Phase MD kill-switch / re-evaluation triggers (Strategy Addendum follow-up, filed 2026-05-12)

**Rule.** Phase MD halts and re-evaluates on any of four explicit triggers:

1. **Milestone trigger (heartbeat).** After the **10th inspired-by preset** ships (i.e., immediately after the first-release bundle if 10+ inspired-by are in it), conduct an explicit "Phase MD health check" review covering:
   - Discipline-rule application across the 10 presets (D-116 / D-121).
   - Catalog character against brand commitment (D-119).
   - Orchestrator scheduling on the D-120 property taxonomy — is the family / concept / paradigm-repeat surface producing varied sessions?
   - Any community signal received (takedown, comment, request).

2. **Takedown signal.** First takedown notice or substantive copyright complaint routed through the projectM team or directly to Uzume. Halt new inspired-by authoring; investigate; respond per D-111 amendment takedown protocol; reopen the legal posture analysis.

3. **Discipline-rule failure.** First M7 review that rejects an inspired-by preset for substantive-similarity reasons (D-116 / D-121 violation). Halt and review whether the discipline rule needs to tighten further (additional bullets, stricter visual-divergence axes, tighter M7 procedure).

4. **Catalog-ratio drift.** Inspired-by share of the production catalog falls below ~50% or rises above ~80% before the second release bundle (or comparable explicit milestone). Review whether the work-distribution model is healthy (Uzume-native authoring keeping pace; inspired-by authoring not over-running).

**Each trigger produces an explicit review session with documented outcome:** *proceed* (continue Phase MD as-is), *adjust* (revise specific decisions; file amendments), *halt* (suspend Phase MD pending resolution). The outcome lands as a follow-up decision (or amendment to D-119 / D-122) in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

**Why.** The base strategy had counsel review as a checkpoint at the start of Phase MD (D-111 original I.1 posture). The 2026-05-12 amendment retired the gate (counsel review remained optional async due diligence; not a precondition). D-122 fills the resulting gap — a 200-preset commitment without checkpoints is a multi-year branch with no integration. The four triggers cover the three substantive risk axes (legal, discipline, scale) plus a milestone heartbeat.

The adversarial review's specific framing was: *"What's the trigger to abandon Phase MD entirely?"* D-122 answers that question without requiring Phase MD to fail catastrophically before re-evaluation — the milestone trigger fires whether or not anything is wrong, on the principle that ten presets is the right unit to look back from.

**Carry-forward.**

- ENGINEERING_PLAN.md Phase MD section gets the four triggers documented as gates.
- The MD.6 "long-tail work stream" increment gets the milestone-10 trigger as its first checkpoint.
- D-119 / D-117 / D-116 / D-121 each name D-122 as their explicit re-evaluation surface — a follow-up that violates the rule in any of those decisions fires the discipline-rule-failure trigger.

## D-123 — `family` taxonomy aligned to cream-of-crop themes; D-120 metadata superseded (filed 2026-05-13)

**Rule.** Uzume's `PresetCategory` enum mirrors the cream-of-crop Milkdrop pack's 10 aesthetic theme directories + 1 `transition` slot. Diagnostic presets (`is_diagnostic: true`) carry no `family`; the field is optional on `PresetDescriptor`.

**Final enum (11 cases):**

> `waveform`, `fractal`, `geometric`, `particles`, `hypnotic`, `supernova`, `reaction`, `drawing`, `dancer`, `sparkle`, `transition`

**What changed and why.**

Pre-D-123: `PresetCategory` had 14 cases — 9 cream-of-crop themes + 4 Uzume-specific additions (`abstract`, `fluid`, `organic`, `instrument`) + 1 unused `transition`. The 5 unused cream-of-crop slots (`supernova`, `reaction`, `drawing`, `dancer`, `transition`) were aspirational for Phase MD.

The 4 Uzume-specific additions were doing catch-all work:
- `abstract` — 3 presets (Murmuration, Ferrofluid Ocean, Kinetic Sculpture) with nothing visually in common. Classic "didn't know where else to put it" bucket.
- `instrument` — 2 diagnostic presets (Spectral Cartograph, Staged Sandbox). Category error: developer tools shouldn't share an enum with aesthetic content.
- `fluid` — 2 presets (Membrane, Volumetric Lithograph) with limited visual overlap; same-register Milkdrop presets would file under `hypnotic` or `geometric` per cream-of-crop convention, creating permanent label-source inconsistency once Phase MD ingests inspired-by uplifts.
- `organic` — 2 presets (Arachne, Gossamer) with shared concept (web) more than shared visual style.

With Phase MD planning to ingest a large body of inspired-by presets from a pack already organized by cream-of-crop conventions, custom Uzume categories create permanent label-source inconsistency: identical visual registers get different labels depending on origin. The cream-of-crop taxonomy is battle-tested against ~9,800 presets over 20+ years; the right move is to mirror it exactly and reassign Uzume-originals into its themes.

**Reassignment of the 15 production presets:**

| Preset | Pre-D-123 | D-123 |
|---|---|---|
| Waveform | waveform | waveform |
| Plasma | hypnotic | hypnotic |
| Nebula | particles | particles |
| Glass Brutalist | geometric | geometric |
| Lumen Mosaic | geometric | geometric |
| Fractal Tree | fractal | fractal |
| Kinetic Sculpture | abstract | **geometric** |
| Murmuration | abstract | **particles** |
| Ferrofluid Ocean | abstract | **geometric** |
| Volumetric Lithograph | fluid | **geometric** |
| Membrane | fluid | **reaction** |
| Arachne | organic | **drawing** |
| Gossamer | organic | **sparkle** |
| Spectral Cartograph | instrument | **(none — diagnostic)** |
| Staged Sandbox | instrument | **(none — diagnostic)** |

The 4 subjective reassignments (Membrane / VL / Ferrofluid Ocean / Gossamer) were Matt's call 2026-05-13. Each had ≥ 2 plausible homes; whichever was picked defines the boundary of that category for future presets.

**Schema change.** `PresetDescriptor.family` becomes `PresetCategory?` (was non-optional with `.waveform` fallback). Missing `family` in JSON now decodes as nil, which is also the correct value for diagnostics. The scorer treats `nil` family as: no family boost, no family-repeat penalty, no fatigue history match — diagnostics are gated upstream by `is_diagnostic` anyway, but the defensive logic is in place for any non-diagnostic preset that ships without a declared family.

**D-120 superseded.** D-120 added `concept_tags` and `motion_paradigm` to enable diversity-scheduling penalties at the orchestrator. The wiring was rejected on the basis that Uzume's planner is multi-preset-per-song and should pick the best SET of presets per song without "avoid back-to-back same X" penalties (memory: `feedback_multi_preset_per_song.md`). Without the wiring, the labels served only descriptive purposes that overlap with `family` — a single well-chosen label is preferable to three. The 5 D-120 commits (`a2e8a6aa..5f29aefe`) were reverted in `0981ca4f` on the same day they landed.

**Catalog clustering observation.** Post-D-123, **5 of 13 aesthetic presets are in `geometric`** (Glass Brutalist, Kinetic Sculpture, Lumen Mosaic, Volumetric Lithograph, Ferrofluid Ocean). The `GoldenSessionTests` regenerated sequences now show the planner producing same-preset repeats (`Membrane × 3` in Session A) and family-repeat-penalty cascades because the catalog is small relative to the family clustering. This is not a planner bug — it's a real symptom of "we don't have enough viable presets yet" surfaced by the taxonomy cleanup. The fix is more presets, not orchestrator changes (Matt 2026-05-13).

**Carry-forward.**

- No further taxonomy work until the catalog grows substantially (next ~20–30 presets from Phase MD inspired-by + new originals).
- The unused cream-of-crop categories (`supernova`, `dancer`, `transition`) remain reserved for Phase MD uplifts and new originals.
- Phase MD inspired-by uplifts ingest into the matching cream-of-crop category on a 1:1 basis — no translation layer needed.
- `GoldenSessionTests` Session A and Session C expected sequences are now anchored to the D-123 catalog state; future taxonomy changes will require regeneration.

## D-127 — §5.8 stage rig retired; aurora reflection retained via direct audio uniforms (V.9 Session 4.5c, 2026-05-14)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-05-14)

### Context

D-125 introduced the `SHADER_CRAFT.md §5.8` stage-rig recipe — 4-6 orbital point lights with per-light palette / intensity / orbital phase, carried via slot-9 fragment buffer + Swift `FerrofluidStageRig` state class. D-126 amended D-125's GPU consumption from Cook-Torrance per-light loop to mirror-reflects-procedural-sky, with `rm_ferrofluidSky` reading the slot-9 buffer's per-light fields as aurora-band parameters. The slot-9 buffer + `FerrofluidStageRig` machinery survived the D-126 amendment.

Matt directed (2026-05-14, this session): "We have already had this conversation about replacing the stage rig with something else. ... The change was from 'stage lighting' to just the aurora reflection." The aurora reflection mechanic (procedural sky overlay the substrate mirror-reflects) stays; the stage-rig framework (orbital lights, slot-9 buffer, `FerrofluidStageRig` class, per-light palette/intensity/phase machinery, JSON `stage_rig` block) is retired.

The discipline failure that preceded this decision is documented inline in the V.9 Session 4.5c prompt under the new "do not assert that a previously-documented mechanism is wired without verifying Matt's current intent" rule. Matt had communicated the deprecation in prior sessions; this session's prompt (V.9 Session 4.5b) preserved the rig in its "what stays unchanged" block; Claude carried the prompt's claim forward without verifying.

### Decisions

**(a) The §5.8 stage rig is removed.** D-125's slot-9 fragment buffer ABI is gone. D-125's `FerrofluidStageRig` Swift class is gone. D-125's `PresetDescriptor.StageRig` decoder and JSON `stage_rig` block are gone. D-125's preamble `StageRigState` MSL struct declarations are gone. The `directPresetFragmentBuffer4` setter on `RenderPipeline` is gone.

**(b) Aurora reflection is preserved via direct audio uniforms.** `rm_ferrofluidSky` continues to be sampled at the reflection vector by the `matID == 2` branch in `raymarch_lighting_fragment`. Aurora content is rebuilt from audio uniforms passed directly into the lighting fragment (V.9 Session 4.5c Phase 1; implementation lands in the next session). Specifically:

- **Hue** ← `vocals_pitch_hz` (perceptual log-scale, confidence-gated at ≥ 0.6) with mood-valence fallback below the confidence threshold. Decision per Matt's 2026-05-14 sign-off ("vocals-pitch with mood fallback").
- **Intensity** ← `drums_energy_dev` smoothed 150 ms τ (same recipe as the retired rig's smoother).
- **Drift** ← curtain azimuth advances at `accumulated_audio_time × arousal × coef`. Slow; pauses at silence.
- **Live-stems gate** ← `smoothstep(0.02, 0.10, totalStemEnergy)` so silence shows the base purple sky only.

The musical contract (vocals → hue, drums → intensity, arousal → motion) is preserved; only the implementation abstraction changes from "orbital point lights with per-light buffer" to "direct audio uniforms read by the sky function."

**(c) D-125 and D-126 are marked HISTORICAL.** The decisions remain in `docs/DECISIONS.md` for the project archaeology but their implementations are gone. Future readers tracing the aurora-reflection mechanism should land on D-127 (this entry) for the current implementation pattern, not D-125 / D-126.

**(d) Phase 2c particle force model is rejected at the same time.** The Leitl-style XZ scatter/drift force model implemented in V.9 Session 4.5b Phase 2c does not produce the wave-undulation character the preset wants. Phase 2c is retired; Session 4.5c Phase 3 replaces it with wave-coherent particle motion aligned to the Gerstner-wave gradient. Phase 2a (spatial-hash bake) and Phase 2b (per-frame compute dispatch hook) infrastructure carries forward unchanged — only the force model is replaced.

### Reason

Real-music testing of Session 4.5b Phase 2c on the Love Rehab session capture (`/Users/braesidebandit/Documents/uzume_sessions/2026-05-14T18-17-51Z`) flagged that:

1. The XZ-scatter / radial-drum-impulse / tangential-rotation force model produces visible scatter, not the *ocean undulation* the preset's design intent calls for.
2. The deviation-only audio gating produces "frozen" visuals during sustained-volume music (which is most of any song) — energy deviations sit near zero except at transient moments.
3. The §5.8 stage rig's orbital-light abstraction is the wrong primitive for "aurora reflection" — orbital geometry doesn't add musical meaning, and the per-light buffer adds infrastructure overhead without payoff.

The replacement design (direct audio uniforms feeding the sky function + baseline+modulation audio routing + wave-coherent particle motion) is structurally simpler, has no orbital-position state machine, and routes audio more directly into perceived motion.

### What was rejected

- **Keep the rig and just tune coefficients.** Matt had already deprecated the rig in prior session communications; carrying the implementation forward against his stated intent was the discipline failure that led to this decision.
- **Mood-only aurora hue (no vocals pitch coupling).** Considered briefly; rejected because aurora-as-mood-only reads as static ambient lighting rather than song-specific musical content. Matt's sign-off (2026-05-14): "Vocals-pitch with mood fallback. I am willing to try your approach; I hope it works out well." (The fallback to mood-only is available if the vocals-pitch coupling reads as too jittery on real music.)
- **Retain the slot-9 buffer ABI for a hypothetical future consumer.** No second consumer was ever planned. Removing the ABI now is cheaper than maintaining placeholder infrastructure.

### Forward references

- V.9 Session 4.5c Phase 1 — direct audio → aurora routing in `rm_ferrofluidSky` (the next session implements).
- V.9 Session 4.5c Phase 2 — baseline + deviation audio routing rework + warmup smoothness fix.
- V.9 Session 4.5c Phase 3 — wave-coherent particle motion (replaces Phase 2c).
- D-125 + D-126 are now historical; cite D-127 for the current aurora-reflection implementation pattern.

## D-LM-palette-library — Curated 18-palette library for Lumen Mosaic cell colour (Increment LM.4.7, filed 2026-05-18; amended 2026-05-18 — selection granularity per-song, not per-session; amended 2026-05-18 — anti-repeat window widened from N=1 to N=3 after Matt's M7 session)

**Status.** Accepted (paperwork-only; implementation lands at Increment LM.4.7).

**Decision.** Lumen Mosaic's per-cell colour source changes from LM.4.6's pure uniform random RGB (with LM.7's per-track chromatic-projected tint) to a **library of 18 hand-authored 12-colour palettes**. The Orchestrator selects one palette **per song** by drawing from a probability distribution biased on the per-track mood (valence + arousal). Within a song, every visible cell samples uniformly from the drawn palette's 12 entries. The per-track seed perturbs **sampling order** within the palette — which 12-bucket a given cell lands in — and never perturbs palette membership. Per-song selection biases against immediate repeats: a song will not draw the same palette as the immediately previous song (the previous palette is removed from the candidate set before the weighted draw); other anti-repeat penalties (last-N, family clustering) are not applied.

The 18 palettes are:

- **Vol. I (7):** Autumnal, Refn Glow, Glacier, Art Deco, Abyssal Bioluminescence, Kintsugi, Carnival.
- **Vol. II (6):** Holi, Geode, Rothko Chapel, Tropical Aviary, Persian Miniature, Ukiyo-e.
- **Plate 14:** Cathedral Lights (the cream-rescission proof point — see D-LM-cream-rescission).
- **Plates 15–18:** Cycladic, Ming Porcelain, Tenebrism, Obsidian.

**Context.** Decision E.2 (4 hand-picked mood-quadrant palette banks) was retired 2026-05-09 on Matt's monotony objection: *"four hand-picked palettes will lead to a very monotonous preset."* LM.4.6 — pure uniform random RGB per cell — replaced it after extended iteration through LM.4.5.x's HSV-with-rules attempts. Matt's verdict on LM.4.6 (2026-05-12) was *"Working. It's close enough. I'm giving up the fight on colors"* — explicitly the white flag, not a positive endorsement. The documented LM.4.6 trade-off (shader file header, ENGINEERING_PLAN Increment LM.4.6, D-LM-7 amendment) is that uniform random sampling produces **statistically identical panel aggregates** across tracks (different specific cell colours, same distribution shape — law of large numbers). LM.7's per-track chromatic-projected tint mitigated this at the aggregate level but did not give each session a distinct **palette character**; every track still looked like a sample from the same uniform RGB cube with a small chromatic offset.

The 2026-05-17 palette exploration conversation produced 18 hand-authored palettes with distinct named characters (mossy stained-glass for Autumnal, warm-neon-shadow for Refn Glow, frozen-blue-on-snow for Glacier, lacquer-and-gold for Art Deco, deep-sea bioluminescent emerald for Abyssal Bioluminescence, gold-on-black-cracked-porcelain for Kintsugi, saturated-festival for Carnival, magenta-yellow-cyan-powder for Holi, mineral-crystal-section for Geode, oxblood-and-charcoal for Rothko Chapel, parrot-feather for Tropical Aviary, manuscript-mineral-pigments for Persian Miniature, woodblock-mineral-flat for Ukiyo-e, jewel-tones-with-cream-highlights for Cathedral Lights, white-ground-with-cobalt for Cycladic, porcelain-and-cobalt for Ming Porcelain, near-black-with-single-warm-highlight for Tenebrism, black-with-iridescent-flash for Obsidian).

**Why the library defuses the original E.2 monotony objection.**

- **Library size (18 ≠ 4).** Four palettes meant any frequent listener saw the same four moods cycle predictably. Eighteen palettes drawn one-per-song means even a five-track listening run traverses five palettes; longer listening runs traverse most of the library.
- **Mood biases selection probability, never deterministic mapping.** The retired E.2 form was "mood quadrant → palette." The library form is "mood → probability distribution over the eligible 17 palettes (after the immediate-repeat exclusion)" — every eligible palette has non-zero probability everywhere in the mood plane, with the distribution shape favouring palettes whose character aligns with the per-track mood. A low-valence high-arousal track is more likely to draw Rothko Chapel or Tenebrism than Carnival, but Carnival is not excluded.
- **Per-song selection, not per-session.** Per-song palette change makes the palette part of how *each track* feels rather than how the *session* feels — a long playlist visibly traverses many palette characters, supporting the multi-preset-per-song product axis (see `feedback_multi_preset_per_song.md`). The previous palette is removed from the candidate set on the next track; the weighted draw runs over the remaining 17. Per-cell variety within a track comes from the seed-driven sampling-order perturbation within the palette plus the existing LM.3.2 band-routed beat-driven dance.

**Orchestrator selection model.**

Each palette declares an **explicit (valence, arousal) anchor** — a 2D point in mood space — as part of its Swift declaration. The weight function is a Gaussian over Euclidean distance from the anchor to the current track's (valence, arousal):

```
weight(palette_i, mood) = exp( -‖mood − anchor_i‖² / (2 × σ²) )
P(palette_i | mood) ∝ weight(palette_i, mood)        for palette_i ∈ candidate set
```

The candidate set is `library \ {previous_palette}` — the immediately previous song's palette is removed before the weighted draw. The first song of a session has no previous palette and draws from the full library of 18.

`σ` (kernel width) is a tunable file-scope constant; default ~0.35 in normalised mood-space units `[-1, +1]` per axis. Tighter σ → mood-fit dominates and most songs draw their highest-affinity palette; looser σ → variety dominates and mood becomes a soft bias. The default lands variety-leaning: even a very-low-valence-very-high-arousal track has non-zero probability of drawing Cathedral Lights, but Tenebrism / Rothko Chapel / Obsidian are much more likely.

The draw is **stable per (track, previous-palette)** — the same `(track identity, previous palette)` always produces the same palette, deterministic via a hash seeded by the track ID. This makes session replay reproducible and makes BUG-014 verification straightforward.

**Per-song sampling.**

Cells sample uniformly from the drawn palette's 12 entries: `cell_palette_idx = lm_hash_u32(cell_id ^ step ^ track_seed ^ section_salt) % 12`. The LM.3.2 team/period beat-step ratchet is preserved — cells advance their palette index on rising-edge of their assigned band's beat — but the index is into the 12-entry palette array, not into the full RGB cube. Per-track seed perturbs sampling order so that consecutive tracks drawing the same palette would (in principle, though the anti-repeat rule prevents this) show distinct cell-by-cell colour layouts; in practice the same-palette case is prevented by the anti-repeat rule and the seed perturbs the within-palette mapping across the (rare) case of returning to a palette later in the playlist.

**Relationship to retired decisions.**

- **E.2 (REVIVED in palette-library form).** Original E.2 (4 mood-quadrant banks) is retired in shape but preserved in spirit: the library architecture is the version that defuses the monotony objection.
- **E.3 (procedural IQ-cosine `palette()`) is superseded** by the library as the cell-colour mechanism for Lumen Mosaic. The `palette()` utility may still appear elsewhere in the engine; it is not the LM.4.7 cell-colour path.
- **D-LM-7 (per-track aggregate-mean RGB tint with chromatic projection)** is superseded for Lumen Mosaic — the LM.4.7 path doesn't need it because the drawn palette is already character-distinct. The chromatic-projection math remains in the codebase only if a future preset needs the same shape; the constant `kTintMagnitude` retires with LM.4.7.
- **D.4 / D.6** are superseded for Lumen Mosaic — the cell-colour generator is now palette-table-driven, not `accumulated_audio_time`-driven (D.4) and not pure hash → RGB (D.6).

**What was rejected.**

- **Per-session selection (one palette for the whole playlist).** Initially documented in the 2026-05-18 paperwork session; reversed in same-day amendment after Matt clarified "one palette per song." Per-song selection makes the palette part of how each track feels and supports the multi-preset-per-song product axis. Per-session would mean a 5-track playlist shows one palette identity even though we have 18 — wastes the curated variety.
- **No anti-repeat rule (pure mood-weighted draw, consecutive repeats allowed).** Rejected because two consecutive tracks drawing the same palette stutter visually — same Voronoi cell colours twice in a row reads as "the preset didn't change" rather than as a deliberate mood emphasis. The immediate-previous-palette exclusion is the smallest mechanism that prevents the stutter without aggressive anti-repeat penalties pushing the draw away from mood-fit.
- **Anti-repeat over a longer window (last-N exclusion for N > 1).** Initially rejected on the prediction that 17 eligible + Gaussian-over-distance weighting would give high palette-character drift without stronger anti-repeat. **Amended 2026-05-18 (post-implementation M7 session):** the prediction was wrong. Matt's 5-track M7 session (Love Rehab → There, There → Pyramid Song → Money → So What) showed within-quadrant clustering — two consecutive tracks whose preview-clip moods landed in the same neighborhood drew two *different* palettes from the same 4–5-palette cluster and read as "the preset didn't change much." The N=1 rule only prevents the exact-same palette twice; it does nothing about "two different palettes that look similar." Window widened to **`kAntiRepeatWindow = 3`** (last-3 exclusion). Library has 18 palettes, so even N=3 leaves 15 mood-weighted candidates per draw — the mood-fit cost per slot is small (the Gaussian is wide enough that the third-highest candidate within a quadrant has comparable mass to the first). The 30 % anti-repeat-induced reduction in mood-fit fidelity, against a library of 18 quadrant-balanced palettes, was the right trade. Re-evaluate at the next M7 review if Matt observes mood-fit erosion.
- **Procedurally-generated palettes (synthesised at session start from a few mood parameters).** Considered; would scale to infinite palettes but loses the hand-authored named character that makes each palette distinct. The conversation's "Cathedral Lights" / "Refn Glow" / "Holi" identities are not reachable by a 4-parameter procedural generator without re-inventing the curation work as a procedural-tuning pass.
- **Hard mood → palette mapping (single palette per mood quadrant).** Replays the E.2 monotony failure — predictable cycling, no surprise.
- **No mood bias at all (uniform random palette draw).** Rejected because sad-music-bright-palette and happy-music-dark-palette mismatches are jarring even when individual palettes are good; biasing the distribution costs nothing and preserves variety.
- **Affinity vector over multiple mood axes** (per-axis weights for valence / arousal / energy / etc.). Considered; more expressive but more authoring overhead per palette. The 2D (valence, arousal) anchor is the simplest declaration that captures the qualitative differences between palettes (warm-low-arousal Rothko Chapel vs cold-high-arousal Glacier vs warm-high-arousal Carnival).
- **Affinity derived from palette statistics (no explicit declaration).** Rejected because it removes the per-palette tuning surface — Matt cannot override "Cathedral Lights reads as low-arousal-moderate-valence" if the statistics-derived anchor disagrees. Explicit anchors are an authoring decision; statistics-derived is an inference Uzume does not need.
- **Larger library (30+ palettes).** Deferred; 18 is the curated count from the 2026-05-17 conversation. Future palette additions are a separate increment under the rule below.

**Rule.** New palette additions require Matt M7 review per palette and a DECISIONS.md amendment citing this D-number. Palette removals are also gated on Matt sign-off — palettes are part of the session-to-session identity of the preset, and silently removing one changes what a returning user sees.

**Carry-forward.** Increment LM.4.7 (ENGINEERING_PLAN.md) is the implementation. The increment ships `LumenMosaicPaletteLibrary.swift` with the 18 palettes as `[SIMD3<Float>]` constants of length 12 + a per-palette `moodAnchor: SIMD2<Float>`, an orchestrator weight function + per-song draw site + previous-palette tracking, an `lm_cell_palette` rewrite that indexes into the per-song palette via cell hash + step + per-track seed, slot-8 GPU ABI extension to carry the 12-colour palette (36 floats or equivalent), rewritten `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` asserting palette membership (every cell colour matches one of the 12 palette entries to within float epsilon), and the LM.9 pale-tone-share gate (per D-LM-cream-rescission) passing for all 18 palettes mechanically.

## D-LM-cream-rescission — Anti-cream project rule rescinded; replaced by pale-tone-share compositional ceiling (Increment LM.4.7, filed 2026-05-18)

**Status.** Accepted (paperwork-only; mechanical enforcement lands at Increment LM.4.7).

**Decision.** The CLAUDE.md project rule that prohibited muted / pastel / cream-haze palettes (introduced after Matt's 2026-05-09 LM.2 verdict and the parallel LM.4.5 v1 rejection) is **rescinded as a categorical exclusion**. It is replaced by a **compositional rule** with mechanical enforcement:

- **Pale tones** (defined as cells whose linear RGB has `min(R, G, B) > 0.65` — cream, ivory, pearl, bone, pale-pink, pale-azure, pale-mint, pale-anything where every channel is in the upper third) are **permitted as structural highlight**.
- **Pale tones are forbidden as dominant ground.** A panel where pale cells exceed **30 %** of total cells (the dominant-area fraction at the standard ~30-visible-cell Voronoi layout) is rejected. This is the mechanical gate.
- **The retired LM.2 / LM.4.5 v1 failure mode is still explicitly forbidden** — mood-tint formulas of the form `mix(cream, hue, sat)` that pull every cell toward a desaturated baseline regardless of input remain an anti-pattern in shader authoring. The distinction is now compositional, not categorical: pale colours appearing in the palette is fine; pale colours **dominating the panel** is not.

**Context.** The 2026-05-09 CLAUDE.md rule ("No muted palettes (mandatory)" + the DO NOT bullet "Do not ship muted, pastel, or cream-haze palettes") was drafted in response to LM.2's all-tinted-cream output and LM.4.5 v1's pastel guardrail that biased every cell toward low-saturation cream regardless of intended palette. Both failure modes shared the same shape — the **whole panel** read as cream — and the rule that landed conflated "panel-dominantly-cream" with "cream-appears-anywhere." Six months of preset authoring under that rule made the conflation visible: real stained-glass references (Sainte-Chapelle, Chartres), Ming porcelain references, Persian-miniature illuminations, and dozens of other historical visual languages use pale highlights against deep jewel-tone or near-black grounds. The blanket prohibition foreclosed all of those palettes.

The 2026-05-17 palette exploration produced **Cathedral Lights** as a deliberate test case. Its design-intent classification (per the Cathedral Lights HTML's "Roles" legend) is 7 ground colours (jewel tones) + 4 light colours + 1 anchor; the design narrative groups Cathedral cream, beeswax honey, pearl ivory, and sky pane as the "light" register. **Erratum (filed at amendment time, 2026-05-18):** under the rule's own definition (linear RGB `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`), only two of those four entries are actually pale — Cathedral cream `F2DEAC` (min channel 0.675) and pearl ivory `EDE4D1` (min channel 0.820). Beeswax honey `E8B95B` has B=0.357 (not pale) and sky pane `87B4D9` has R=0.529 (not pale). The realised pale-share under uniform sampling is therefore `2/12 ≈ 16.7 %`, not the `4/12 ≈ 33 %` originally cited in this paragraph. The earlier intuition argument confused the design-narrative "light" group with the rule's mechanical definition; the rule itself was correctly defined, and Cathedral Lights passes the 30 % ceiling comfortably (~17 % expected pale-share, well clear of 30 %). The 30 % calibration point remains correct as the boundary above which a panel starts reading as cream-dominant; Cathedral Lights stays inside that boundary even at peak hash-draw variance.

**The compositional rule (the load-bearing distinction a future preset author must read).**

- **Cream as accent against saturated ground = permitted.** The visual language is *"deep jewel tones interrupted by points of cream-coloured light"* — Cathedral Lights, Ming Porcelain, Persian Miniature, Cycladic at the pale-rich end, and any future palette that places pale highlights in the < 30 % minority. The pale cells read as **structural highlight**: the lit pieces of glass in a stained-glass window, the pearlescent dots in a Mughal manuscript, the lime-wash of a Cycladic structure against the sea.
- **Cream as dominant surface = rejected.** A panel where the eye reads "this is mostly cream/pale with some colour" is the LM.2 failure mode. Mechanically: > 30 % of cells with `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`. The pale-tone-share gate (LM.9, see D-LM-palette-library carry-forward) enforces this per fixture frame.

**Mechanical enforcement.**

- **Per fixture frame:** classify each cell by its linear RGB. Pale if `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`; not pale otherwise.
- **Gate:** reject the fixture if `pale_cell_count / total_cells > 0.30`.
- **Where it runs:** the LM.9 certification gate set, applied to every Lumen Mosaic palette in the library (D-LM-palette-library) and to every future palette addition.
- **Calibration point:** Cathedral Lights passes at ~17 % nominal pale-cell share (2 of 12 palette entries pale under the rule's linear-RGB definition; see Erratum in the Context section above). At the 30 % ceiling, ~13 percentage points of margin remain for hash-draw variance — comfortable. A palette with > 4 pale entries out of 12 (i.e. > 33 % palette pale-share under the rule's definition) will trip the gate on most hash draws and is rejected at palette-author time.

**Why a hard ceiling rather than a soft penalty.**

A soft scoring penalty (e.g. "pale-share weighted into orchestrator score") would let cream-haze palettes survive on tie-breakers. The LM.2 failure mode is the kind of regression that needs a hard floor; allowing it back in by score is the original failure mode by another name. The 30 % ceiling is below the boundary where a panel starts reading as cream-dominant (≥ ~40 % is unambiguously cream-haze; the 25–35 % band is the structural-highlight register) and gives ~5 percentage points of margin for hash-draw variance against the Cathedral Lights calibration point.

**What was rejected.**

- **Keeping the categorical anti-cream rule.** Forecloses every stained-glass / porcelain / miniature / Cycladic palette. The 2026-05-17 palette exploration produced five palettes (Cathedral Lights, Cycladic, Ming Porcelain, plus Persian Miniature and Ukiyo-e at the pale-rich end) that would all have been excluded — and Matt accepted each as ship-worthy on visual preview.
- **A higher pale-tone-share ceiling (40 %, 50 %).** Tested against the LM.2 failure-mode threshold; cream-haze starts reading at ~40 % and above. 30 % is the calibrated ceiling that admits structural-highlight palettes (Cathedral Lights at ~25 %, others below) and rejects cream-dominant panels (≥ ~40 %).
- **A lower ceiling (20 %, 15 %).** Excludes Cathedral Lights and any palette with a deliberate large pale-highlight share. The cream-rescission is what makes those palettes shippable; tightening the ceiling reproduces the original rule at a different threshold without solving the underlying conflation.
- **HSV-domain definition of "pale" instead of linear-RGB `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`.** HSV-pale (`S < 0.25 ∧ V > 0.85`) and linear-RGB-pale agree on the obvious cases but diverge at the pale-saturated edge (pale magenta, pale teal). The linear-RGB definition catches both achromatic-pale and chromatic-pale-with-all-channels-high; the HSV definition lets chromatic-pale-with-high-V through. The LM.2 failure mode is panel-wide low-channel-variance; the linear-RGB form maps more directly onto that failure.

**Rule.** The pale-tone-share ceiling (≤ 0.30) is the project's compositional rule on cream / pale in Uzume presets going forward. Authoring guidance (CLAUDE.md, SHADER_CRAFT.md) is updated to reflect this. The categorical "Do not ship muted, pastel, or cream-haze palettes" wording is retired; the parallel CLAUDE.md DO NOT bullet is rewritten under this decision. The mood-tint anti-pattern (`mix(cream, hue, sat)`) remains forbidden as a shader-authoring shape — but as an anti-pattern in the implementation, not as a categorical exclusion of pale colours from the palette space.

**Scope.** This decision governs Lumen Mosaic at LM.4.7 directly. It applies project-wide to any preset that exposes a per-cell or per-shard discrete colour register — future palette-based presets inherit the same gate. Continuous-colour presets (ray-march scenes, fluid simulations, plasma-family) are not in scope; their colour discipline lives in SHADER_CRAFT.md material cookbook recipes (e.g. mat_chitin, mat_oceanWater) where the relevant rule is per-recipe saturation and roughness, not aggregate pale-share.

**Carry-forward.** Increment LM.4.7 (ENGINEERING_PLAN.md) implements the pale-tone-share gate in `LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` (or wherever the LM.9 cert gates land in code) and verifies it passes for all 18 palettes in the library — Cathedral Lights being the calibration point. The CLAUDE.md DO NOT bullet is updated in this same paperwork session. The Visual Quality Floor pointer is updated to refer to the pale-tone-share rule rather than the retired no-muted-palettes rule.


## D-128 — Local-file playback uses an in-process AVAudioEngine, not the Core Audio process tap (LF.1, 2026-05-27)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-05-27).

**Context.** The Core Audio process-tap path (`AudioHardwareCreateProcessTap`) has accumulated several documented pain points: DRM-triggered silent zeros (FA #22 / SilenceDetector / D-022 tap-reinstall scheduler), screen-capture permission as a hard prerequisite for non-zero delivery (FA #22), scrub-induced teardown requiring backoff-installed recovery (ARCH §Audio Capture), and no first-class playhead. The process-tap also assumes Uzume is a passive observer of audio someone else is playing — `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` codifies the "Uzume does not control playback" principle, and the streaming path strictly observes it. LF.1 is the first spike in an LF.1 → LF.4 discovery arc exploring whether Uzume playing local files itself — owning the playhead, decode path, and analysis tap — bypasses those problems for that specific source.

**Decision.** A new `InputMode.localFilePlayback(URL)` case routes to a `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` class that:

1. Opens an `AVAudioFile` (Float32 planar at the file's native rate — 44100 Hz for love_rehab.m4a).
2. Drives an `AVAudioEngine` graph: `AVAudioPlayerNode → engine.mainMixerNode → outputNode`.
3. Installs the analysis tap on the **player node's output bus (bus 0)**, pre-mixer and pre-volume. The user's output-volume control does not affect the analysis signal.
4. Forwards interleaved float32 PCM through the existing `onAudioSamples` callback so the downstream `UMARingBuffer` / FFT / MIR / stem pipeline is source-agnostic. The provider manually interleaves planar L/R into the L/R/L/R layout `SystemAudioCapture` delivers (matching `AudioInputRouter.startFilePlayback`'s pattern for the existing `.localFile` diagnostic mode).
5. Loops at EOF (re-schedules the file via `AVAudioPlayerNode.scheduleFile`'s completion handler), matching the existing `.localFile` mode's `file.framePosition = 0` behavior.
6. Observes `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` and restarts on fire (best-effort from beginning; mid-track resumption deferred).

`AudioInputRouter`'s tap-reinstall scheduler (`+SignalState.swift`) is mode-gated so it is dormant in both `.localFile` and `.localFilePlayback` modes — those modes have no process tap to reinstall, and silence in a played file is real musical silence, not a teardown.

The launch path reads `UZUME_LOCAL_FILE_PLAYBACK` at app start (`.task` modifier on `ContentView` in `UzumeApp.swift`). When the env var points at a readable file, `VisualizerEngine.startLocalFilePlayback(url:)` flips `localFilePlaybackActive`, starts the LF provider, runs the stem pipeline, and transitions `SessionManager` to ad-hoc / `.playing`. `startAudio()` (the process-tap launch path that `PlaybackView.setup()` calls unconditionally) checks `localFilePlaybackActive` first and short-circuits — without this guard, the systemAudio tap install would call `AudioInputRouter.stopInternal()` and tear down the LF provider milliseconds after it started. `ContentView`'s permission gate also checks `localFilePlaybackActive` so the visualizer renders even on a fresh install where screen-capture permission was never granted.

**Coexistence with existing `.localFile(URL)` mode.** The new case is a sibling, not a replacement. `.localFile(URL)` is preserved byte-identical: it feeds PCM into the analysis pipeline at near-real-time without playing audio through speakers. `SoakTestHarness` (D-060) and `CaptureModeReconciler`'s settings toggle (D-052) continue to use `.localFile`. `SoakTestHarnessTests` is the regression gate — green after LF.1 lands. Future increments (LF.2+) might converge the two cases, but the LF.1 spike preserves the diagnostic path intact.

**Relationship to the PRODUCT_SPEC.md "Uzume does not control playback" principle.** This decision intentionally and narrowly amends the principle for the local-file source. The streaming path (Apple Music, Spotify) is untouched — Uzume continues to passively observe audio the user controls in their streaming app. The local-file path is the exception: when Uzume plays a local file itself, it owns the playhead because the file has no separate playback owner to coordinate with. The scope of the amendment is the new `.localFilePlayback` mode only; the principle stands for every other source. If LF.4 graduates this spike to a shipping feature, the UX_SPEC.md surfaces (settings audio-source picker, drag-and-drop, etc.) will need to make the playback-controlling-app distinction explicit so the user is not surprised by Uzume producing sound for local files but not for streaming.

**Rejected alternatives.**

- **Reuse the existing `.localFile(URL)` case + add a "play through speakers" flag.** Conflates the diagnostic-injection contract (used by `SoakTestHarness` since 7.1) with the user-facing playback contract. Adding a flag risks accidental playback during soak runs and complicates the SoakTestHarness regression gate. Sibling cases keep both contracts byte-identical and let each evolve independently.

- **Use `AVAudioFile` + `AVAudioEngine` but route through the same backing implementation as `.localFile`.** Same conflation problem, plus the existing `.localFile` implementation uses a `Task.detached` polling loop with `Task.sleep(for:)` — appropriate for diagnostic injection but a poor fit for real-time playback where `AVAudioEngine`'s own scheduling is the right tool.

- **Hijack the process-tap path to play audio in Uzume's own process.** Possible in principle (Core Audio aggregate devices can include both inputs and outputs), but defeats the entire premise of the spike — the goal was to bypass the process-tap path's documented problems, not work around them.

- **A separate top-level `PlaybackSource` abstraction parallel to `InputMode`.** Premature. The spike scope is "does owning playback work end-to-end" — adding a new abstraction is LF.4 work if the spike succeeds. LF.1 reuses `InputMode` because that's the smallest change that proves the concept.

**Verification (manual + automated).** The LF.1 closeout's manual verification reports a clean run on `love_rehab.m4a`: 1684 features.csv frames over 28.96 s (matching the fixture's 29.93 s with the expected ~1 s startup gap), raw_tap.wav at the file's native 44100 Hz with healthy RMS ≈ 0.31 (max amplitude 1.0 — Love Rehab's mastered peaks), session.log clean of any "Tap reinstall scheduled" / "CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess" / "DRM silence" lines, and an installed live BeatGrid at 118.5 BPM matching the track's true tempo within rounding. The two new regression tests `test_scheduleNextReinstall_isNoOpInLocalFilePlaybackMode` and `test_scheduleNextReinstall_isNoOpInLocalFileMode` lock the mode-gate behavior so a future tap-reinstall edit cannot re-enable scheduling for either mode.

**Out of scope (deferred).** Per the LF.1 prompt:
- ~~Stem separation pre-analysis of the full track (LF.2).~~ **Done in LF.2 — see D-129.**
- Persistent content-keyed stem cache (LF.3).
- Folder ingestion, M3U import, playlist semantics (LF.4).
- Drag-and-drop UI, settings audio-source picker, output-device routing (LF.4).
- Crossfade / gapless segue (LF.4).
- ID3/Vorbis tag extraction, album art display (LF.4).
- `SessionManager` integration (LF.4).
- ~~A/B comparison vs. process-tap on the same audio (LF.1.5).~~ **Done in LF.1.5 — see empirical characterization below.**
- Concurrency hardening of `tapSampleRate` propagation (separate ongoing task).
- ~~Format-coverage testing across MP3 / FLAC / M4A / AAC (LF.2).~~ **Done in LF.2 — see D-129.**

**Empirical characterization (LF.1.5, 2026-05-27).** A/B comparison on `love_rehab.m4a` (host: Mac mini M2 Pro, system default output Apogee Duet 3 at 48 kHz) — `docs/diagnostics/LF1.5_AB_COMPARISON_2026-05-27.md`. Verdict: **characterizable deltas**, all explainable by known structural differences; no unexpected divergence. Headline numbers (LF vs tap, middle 80 % of active window):

- **BPM agreement:** LF 118.7 / tap 118.0 (Δ = 0.67 BPM, well within ±3). Both paths share the same ~6 BPM offset vs the track's true 125 BPM tempo, a Beat This! short-window characteristic that is path-independent.
- **Sample rate:** LF 44100 Hz (file native), tap 48000 Hz (system default). Unavoidable structural delta; FFT bin width scales with the rate ratio, which shifts `spectralCentroid` (single-fixture: ~22 % in normalized units, LF 0.087 / tap 0.068) and propagates downstream into `MoodClassifier` outputs (valence +34 %, arousal -38 %). **Corpus-scale update (CENSUS.3, 993 tracks, 2026-07-08): the cross-path centroid skew measures ~9 % — the single-fixture 22 % over-stated it.** Cross-path *absolute* mood comparison is NOT valid; cross-path *relative* mood comparison within a session IS valid.
- **Volume / amplitude:** LF pre-mixer at ~0 dBFS, tap post-output at ~-8 dBFS (2.5× quieter). AGC compresses but does not fully eliminate this level difference: load-bearing bands all skew tap-lower by 17–24 % (subBass -17 %, bass -24 %, treble -23 %, mid noise-floor) in the same direction proportional to the level ratio. This is consistent with the AGC's running-average converging to a lower baseline on the quieter input. The volume-level skew on the tap path is a known property of the existing process-tap architecture (`RUNBOOK.md §Audio levels too low`); the LF path does not have this dependency by construction.

**Implications for downstream LF increments.** Within the tolerance Uzume's downstream consumers need, the load-bearing musical metrics (BPM, subBass, sub-bass onset rate) agree across paths. Stems extracted from either path will be analyzed against a consistent beat reference. The cross-path centroid + mood deltas are SR-driven and path-stable (re-running the same fixture on the same path gives the same numbers), so the LF arc can proceed without compensating for them at the analysis layer. Single-fixture characterization — cross-track variance is LF.2 territory.

## D-137 — Dragon Bloom: feedback-native UPLIFT (strands ← stems), not a literal Milkdrop copy (Dragon Bloom, 2026-06-02)

### Context

Matt M7 on Spike 2 (session `2026-06-02T13-37-09Z`) confirmed bilateral symmetry (no clipart) but flagged "not really seeing petals." Reading `source.milk` (and confirming in a faithful butterchurn reference — `tools/dragon_bloom_reference/`) established that **Spike 1's mechanic is structurally different from the reference's** (flat polar ring vs. 3 tumbling 3-D spectral strands + a 5-fold `sin(ang·5)^5` per-pixel petal warp + a chromatic colour-separation warp shader, smeared through heavy feedback). See DRAGON_BLOOM_PLAN §0.

Matt then reframed the work: **"This is an UPLIFT specifically for Phosphene. Recommend an approach to translating this preset to Phosphene's platform and taking better advantage of the technologies that are part of Phosphene but were not a part of Milkdrop/Butterchurn."** — i.e., translate the preset's *identity*, do not slavishly reproduce Milkdrop's line-drawing + HLSL-warp mechanics.

### Decision

Uplift Dragon Bloom in Uzume's **mv_warp feedback register** (D-027 — the original's charm is procedural feedback, and this is Uzume's most-proven capability), uplifting along three axes Uzume is strong and Milkdrop was weak:

1. **Strands ← real stems (headline musical uplift).** Milkdrop drives its 3 custom waves by mid/bass/treble FFT bands; Uzume has stem separation. The 3 bloom strands map to **drums / bass / vocals** (Matt's pick, 2026-06-02); `other` tints the palette. Each arm of the bloom is legibly an instrument. Driven via deviation primitives (D-026); stems available frame-1 via StemCache.
2. **HDR-glow strands + ACES tonemap** (vs Milkdrop's 8-bit clamped additive).
3. **valence + spectral-centroid warm palette + per-stem tinting** (the former Spike 3).

Kept: bilateral symmetry (D-136 fold), mv_warp feedback, bass breathing, and the chromatic colour-separation (ported into the compose pass; the hand-written GLSL in `tools/dragon_bloom_reference` `fixWarpShader` is the reference spec).

**Explicitly rejected (Matt agreed): a full ray-march / 3-D volumetric rebuild.** It changes the preset's identity, is the high-fidelity-hero register that has repeatedly stalled (Drift Motes D-102, Ferrofluid, Aurora Veil), and the original's magic — feedback — is already native to mv_warp. A 3-D depth exploration, if ever wanted, is a separate spike, not the main path.

### Rationale

Choosing the feedback register over a 3-D rebuild trades maximal use of Uzume's hero tech for **fidelity reliability** — the consistent failure mode (FA #58/#61/#62) is overreaching on hero-material/3-D fidelity. The uplift still uses distinctly-Uzume capabilities (stem separation, HDR, mood-driven palette, mv_warp) that Milkdrop lacked, so it is a genuine platform uplift, not a port. The stems→strands mapping is the load-bearing musical-role upgrade (per `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive`: one primitive per layer — each strand consumes one stem).

### Engine surfaces (modest — far short of a ray-march rebuild)

- A path to **draw the 3 strands** (the `per_point` projected points): prototype the cheapest faithful option first (procedural-vertex strand geometry vs. fragment splat). Per-pixel min-distance over the full high-frequency strand curve is too expensive (~512 samples × 3 strands × all pixels), so geometry/procedural-vertex is the likely path.
- A **chromatic colour-transform in the mv_warp compose pass** (small shader addition).

### Build (layered; each verified against the faithful live oracle + gif/still)

L1 strands ← drums/bass/vocals (HDR glow) · L2 `per_pixel` petal warp → `mvWarpPerVertex` · L3 chromatic transform in compose · L4 decay/echo/invert blend · L5 valence/centroid palette + per-stem tint. Offline verification extends the diag harness to load the real recorded tap (`raw_tap.wav`), not the synthetic sine.

### Gate

Per-layer Matt M7 against the faithful live reference + `01_target.png`/`target_animated.gif`. The reference harness (`tools/dragon_bloom_reference/`) is the comparison oracle; its warp-shader fix (hand-written GLSL) is what makes it faithful.

## D-138 — Dragon Bloom: faithful butterchurn render-loop port + music response, certified (Dragon Bloom, 2026-06-02)

### Context

D-137's layered uplift (L1–L5) reached a warm symmetric bloom but L4 ("rich warm FILL") turned into a multi-hour struggle: the render kept diverging from the live butterchurn oracle (pale/washed, under-filled, then over-bright/flat, then jittery). **Root cause was method, not difficulty:** the work was patching Uzume's `mv_warp` — a *structurally different* feedback engine — to imitate butterchurn one divergence at a time, instead of replicating butterchurn's render loop wholesale by reading its source. Each fix corrected one symptom and exposed the next. (Promoted to a Failed Approach — see CLAUDE.md FA #70.)

### Decision

Replicate butterchurn's custom-warp render loop verbatim for Dragon Bloom (read from `tools/dragon_bloom_reference/butterchurn.min.js`), then layer the Uzume music-response uplift on top. **Dragon Bloom is certified** (Matt live M7 across 5 Spotify tracks + a local file, 2026-06-02 sessions `…20-59-52Z` → `…21-46-36Z`).

### The butterchurn render loop (durable reference — these are the load-bearing facts)

Per frame: **swap prev↔target → warp(prev) into target → draw waves normal-alpha ON TOP of target → target IS next frame's feedback; comp (echo/gamma/invert) is display-only.** Specifics verified in the bundle:

1. **No decay on custom-warp presets.** `fDecay` is applied ONLY in the *default* warp (`ret = sample(prev)·decay`). A preset with a custom warp shader sets `warpColor=(1,1,1,1)` and does `fragColor = ret·vColor` = no decay; the custom shader self-regulates the feedback via its normalise + R→G→B transfer (the B-fade). Uzume was double-decaying → starved edges (pale background), field converged to the instantaneous wave draw (no accumulation).
2. **8-bit feedback textures (`UNSIGNED_BYTE` RGBA, CLAMP_TO_EDGE, LINEAR).** The per-frame clamp is load-bearing — at no-decay it holds the field at a saturated equilibrium. A float (rgba16f) buffer over-accumulates to pale near-white. (Earlier I made it float thinking 8-bit caused the pale wash; the opposite is true once the loop is correct.)
3. **Custom waves blend NORMAL-alpha** (`wavecode_*_bAdditive=0`; the global `bAdditiveWaves=1` is for the built-in waveform only), drawn directly onto the warped target. Additive piled the centre-converging strands into a white core (→ black after invert).
4. **Comp is display-only.** echo (orient-1 horizontal flip, alpha 0.5) → `ret *= gammaAdj` (1.07, a MULTIPLY not pow) → `if(brighten) ret=sqrt(ret); if(darken) ret=ret*ret` (both set ⇒ **cancel**) → `if(invert) ret=1-ret`.
5. **Bilateral symmetry comes from the video echo** (horizontal mirror at comp), NOT strand mirroring. So 3 waves, not 6 mirrored instances.
6. **`fWaveAlpha` is the built-in-waveform alpha, not custom waves.** Custom-wave alpha = per-point `a` × `bModWaveAlphaByVolume` ramp.
7. **butterchurn feeds 6×-boosted audio** (tap ≈ −18 dB); `bModWaveAlphaByVolume`'s 0.71/1.30 bounds assume that scale — so Uzume's raw stem energies are boosted 6× before the ramp (else quiet stems gate the waves to ~0).
8. **The warp is a 32×24 vertex mesh** (`warpUVs` per mesh vertex, interpolated) — Uzume's `mvWarpPerVertex` grid matches it. A per-fragment recompute is both unfaithful and costs trig per pixel; use the mesh.

### Music response (D-137 uplift, on top of the faithful loop)

- **Each arm is an instrument** (headline): drums/bass/vocals → strand length (`mod`) + brightness (`modVol`).
- **Breathing (primary continuous):** the warp zoom expands on loud bass and settles when it thins (reformulated from source `per_pixel_8`, which pinned at the 1.05 cap and never breathed).
- **Per-arm transient flare (accent):** each arm brightens on its own stem's deviation (D-026) — smeared by the feedback.
- **Beat pulse (accent, at the comp/DISPLAY stage so it punches through the no-decay feedback instead of being smeared):** a smoothed attack/decay envelope on `beatComposite` (shaped to its strong peaks; the drums-stem dev was too noisy on the process-tap and caused flicker) drives a subtle per-beat pump (4% zoom) + brighten (12%).
- **Tumble on `accumulated_audio_time`** (energy-weighted, pauses at silence) instead of free-running wall-clock (FA #33).

### Engine changes (Dragon-Bloom-scoped; other mv_warp presets byte-identical — PresetRegression)

- `mvWarp_fragment`: full warp transfer (normalise + hue-zoom resample + R→G→B transfer) gated by `chromaticMix`; **no decay** on the custom-warp path.
- `mvWarp_blit_fragment`: faithful comp (echo + gamma + invert) + the beat-pulse pump/brighten, via a float4 `post` uniform (`setMVWarpPost`; `(0,0,1,0)` ⇒ identity for other presets).
- `drawWithMVWarp`: for presets with a scene-geometry overlay (Dragon Bloom), warp-no-decay → strands normal-alpha on top → blit (skips the scene + decayed-compose path). Smoothed beat envelope (`mvWarpBeatEnv`) computed per-frame.
- Strand pipeline blend → normal alpha; feedback textures → 8-bit (`feedbackFormat` reverted to the drawable format).

### Pitfall recorded

The float→8-bit revert must change BOTH the pipeline format (`PresetLoader.feedbackFormat`) AND the app's `MVWarpPipelineBundle.feedbackFormat` — a mismatch (8-bit pipeline rendering into a float texture) is an attachment-format mismatch that **stalls the GPU (beachball) at the preset transition**, not a clean error.

## D-139 — Fata Morgana: faithful butterchurn mirage port + coordinated bar-sway stem uplift, certified (Fata Morgana, 2026-06-03)

### Context

Second butterchurn port after Dragon Bloom (D-138). `martin [shadow harlequins shape code] - fata morgana` is a **mirage** — starfield night sky, a glowing cycling horizon, and a reflective rippling neon floor. Render loop replicated wholesale from source per FA #70: a custom feedback **WARP** (blur-driven swirl + lattice, bakes its own `×0.98−0.02` decay), a custom procedural **COMP** (the mirage projection — perspective floor, horizon glow, grid stars, water reflection; display-only, fully replaces fixed-function gamma/darken/echo), a wide-ish **blur1**, and custom **SHAPES** drawn on top of the warped target (= the feedback). Per frame: `warp(prev) → blur → shapes-on-top → comp → swap`.

### Decision

Ship Fata Morgana as a **certified** preset (Matt live M7 across the iterative movement-tuning sessions 2026-06-03, closing on `…17-08-42Z`). The faithful port is uplifted with stem separation; the visual identity is **three neon spectra (drums/bass/vocals) swaying over the water in time with the bars**.

### Faithful-port facts (durable; verified against butterchurn source)

- **Warp:** line-for-line from the converted JSON — `rot = dot(blur1, roam_sin)·16`, displacement `0.2·luma·rotate(p, rot)` (calmed to `0.15` in the uplift — see below), texsize lattice, `ret = main(uv1)·0.98 − 0.02`.
- **`zoom = 1.05`** comes from `pixel_eqs` (`a.zoom=1.05`), which overrides `baseVals.zoom=0.9999`. It is faithful — content flows outward 5%/frame, and the zoom feedback of the shapes is what forms the concentric neon rings.
- **Custom comp fully replaces fixed-function.** `gammaadj`/`darken`/`echo`/`invert` are the DEFAULT-comp body (`butterchurn.js` ~3550, `if shaderText.length === 0`); a custom comp does NOT apply them. The mirage's horizon-glow colour is `(0.02/(0.02+|xf|))·slow_roam_sin` — `slow_roam_sin = 0.5+0.5·sin(time·{.005,.008,.013,.022})`.
- **blur1** is a separable gaussian stored at ~0.25 res (`blurRatios[0]=[0.5,0.25]`), spanning ~±4 source texels — MODERATE, not wide. The warp derives its swirl direction from blur1, so blur width governs **rings vs ribbons**: too wide → coherent large-scale swirl twists the zoom-echo rings into smeared ribbons. (An early over-wide ×6 blur was the smear; corrected to ×2 ≈ ±4 texels.)
- **Grid stars** are gated by `pw_noise_lq` — a POINT-WRAP (nearest-sampled) random texture, so the lit cells scatter into a starfield. Sampling smooth Perlin instead gives a regular diagonal Moiré lattice.

### Three durable engine/port lessons (promoted to CLAUDE.md Failed Approaches)

1. **sRGB round-trip for sRGB-naive ports (FA #71).** butterchurn writes to an sRGB-naive WebGL canvas (shader output = display value). Uzume's drawable is `.bgra8Unorm_srgb`, so Metal sRGB-ENCODES the comp output → lifted blacks / washed midtones. Fix: sRGB-DECODE the comp output so the target's encode round-trips back to the source's display values. Only the final comp→drawable write needs it (the feedback textures are linear `.bgra8Unorm`, matching butterchurn's 8-bit clamp).
2. **`time` magnitude, not phase, drove the "gray horizon" (FA #71 corollary).** `slow_roam_sin`'s slowest period is ~21 min, so it only leaves the pale opening quarter once `time` reaches the hundreds of seconds. The oracle was sampled minutes in (saturated, spectrum-cycling); a fresh render sat in the pale quarter. Fix: phase-seed the glow clock (`+400 s` base) so it opens mid-cycle; plus a **per-session random jitter** (~one 21-min period) so every session opens on a different horizon hue (a deliberate, Matt-requested divergence — butterchurn itself has no such jitter).
3. **MSL `FeatureVector`/`StemFeatures` fields are snake_case (FA #72).** Using the Swift name (`f.beatPhase01`) in `.metal` silently fails to compile and the preset is **dropped from the loader** (`PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` count 18→17 caught it). The fields are `f.beat_phase01`, `f.bar_phase01`, `st.drums_energy_dev`, etc.

### Music uplift (the design Matt converged on over the movement-tuning pass)

The journey is instructive (each step is a recorded session): per-onset size **bursts** read as "too excited / more bursts than beats" (drums_beat + dev fire on every onset); a per-blob **bar-direction reversal** was "lost among the many spectra"; a whole-field **downbeat zoom breath** synced but wasn't the vision. The converged design:

- **COUNT:** the source's 4/1/5-instance shapes were a crowd (chaos). Cut to **ONE instance per instrument** (drums/bass/vocals) + the faint central echo — 3 bright spectra.
- **MOTION — coordinated bar sway (headline):** the 3 spectra share a horizontal sway `A·cos(π·swayClock)`, `swayClock` advancing **+1 per bar** (accumulated `barPhase01` deltas, downbeat wrap handled) → a 2-bar cosine that turns at each downbeat. **Phase-offset** so they stay balanced: drums (phase 0) and vocals (phase 1.0) are anti-phase (one swings right while the other swings left), bass (phase 0.5) weaves centre — at every downbeat they sit right/centre/left, never bunched. Frozen when no bar grid is present.
- **POSITION:** base `y < 0.5` puts them above the horizon (the comp samples the sky at feedback `v ∈ [0 top, 0.5 horizon]`, and a shape's `v` equals its `y`, so `y > 0.5` reads as IN the water).
- **BRIGHTNESS:** one gentle pulse per GRID beat (`pow(1−beat_phase01, 4)`, not per-onset `drums_beat`) + per-stem `_energy_dev` for instrument identity.
- **Swirl calmed** to `0.15·luma` (from the faithful `0.2`) so the swaying spectra streak less (Matt-requested).

### Authoring lesson (durable)

**Few coordinated subjects beat many independent ones for a legible musical gesture.** A bar-synced motion on 11 independent orbits is invisible (chaos); the same gesture on 3 phase-coordinated subjects reads clearly. When a coupling "isn't reading," check subject COUNT and COORDINATION before increasing amplitude. (Project-scope twin of FA #67 one-primitive-per-layer.)

## D-142 — Canvas-hold accumulation is the no-decay / identity CONFIG of the mv_warp brush-on-feedback paradigm (Skein.ENGINE.1, 2026-06-05)

**Date:** 2026-06-05. **Status:** implemented (Skein.ENGINE.1); pending Matt's sign-off (the increment gate). Establishes the persistent, lossless paint canvas for the `Skein` action-painting preset (`docs/presets/SKEIN_DESIGN.md`).

**Context.** Skein needs a feedback canvas that *accumulates* marks without decaying or resampling them — paint lands, stays, and is occluded only by later opaque paint-over-paint (the temporal-integral canvas, `SKEIN_DESIGN.md §1.4 / §5`). This is architecturally the **no-decay / identity configuration of Dragon Bloom's brush-on-feedback loop** (D-135 / D-138): warp the previous frame, then composite new geometry normal-alpha on top. Skein differs only in setting the warp to **identity** (paint doesn't move) and decay **off** (paint persists). The Skein design doc (§3 gap report, §8 #5) and plan (locked decision #5) had anticipated this would need an **explicit new "canvas-hold mode" added to the mv_warp family** (an engine addition).

**The ENGINE.1 audit superseded that framing.** Canvas-hold is reachable as **pure per-preset CONFIG of the existing mv_warp machinery — no UzumeEngine source change, no new warp mode** — exactly as the design's own §0 / §5.1 already characterize it ("a configuration of existing machinery, not a new paradigm"). The four properties and where each is set on the Dragon Bloom path:
- **Identity warp** — the preset's `mvWarpPerVertex` returns `uv` unchanged + `mvWarpPerFrame` zoom=1/rot=0/offsets=0 (`Skein.metal`); the engine `mvWarp_vertex` already calls the preset functions.
- **No decay** — the preset's `mvWarpPerFrame` returns `decay = 1.0`; the shared `mvWarp_fragment`'s `decayMul = (chromaticMix > 0) ? 1.0 : in.decay` (`PresetLoader+WarpPreamble.swift:206`) resolves to `in.decay = 1.0`.
- **No R→G→B transfer** — `mvWarpChromatic = 0` (the default; `RenderPipeline.swift:50`), which collapses both the hue-zoom resample (`sUV = mix(baseUV, zoomedUV, 0)`) and the colour transfer (`mix(cr, warm, 0)`) to identity. The app already sets `setMVWarpChromatic(0.0)` for any preset with no scene-geometry overlay (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:397`).
- **Marks-on-top** — the existing `setSceneGeometry` strands-on-top mechanism (D-138). Not exercised live at ENGINE.1 (Skein ships no marks yet); Skein.1 wires its real marks through this same path.

**No-decay is NOT bound to the colour transfer.** The decisive line `decayMul = (chromaticMix > 0.0) ? 1.0 : in.decay` lets a preset choose no-decay (`pf.decay=1.0`) **without** the transfer (`chromaticMix=0`) — they are independent. Net: under identity + no-decay + no-transfer, `mvWarp_fragment` returns the previous canvas **byte-for-byte**. `SkeinCanvasHoldTest` proves this empirically — **whole-frame Hamming 0 across 130 hold frames** (256×256, sRGB feedback) through the live scene → warp → blit → swap dispatch path, confirming the sRGB 8-bit round-trip and identity-at-pixel-centers are both exact. 8-bit is therefore lossless (`SKEIN_DESIGN.md §5.5`); no linear-format or nearest-sampler override was needed.

**Decision.** Canvas-hold accumulation is ratified as the **no-decay / identity configuration of the mv_warp brush-on-feedback paradigm (D-135 / D-138)** — a sibling of Dragon Bloom (`passes: ["direct","mv_warp"]`), explicitly **not** paradigm-stacking and **not a D-029 concern**. It is realized as a preset recipe + this decision record, **not** a new engine mode — which fully satisfies the intent of plan decision #5 ("a legible canvas-hold precedent; a clean sibling of Dragon Bloom; not an overload of the narrow `feedback`/Membrane path") with no redundant engine code. Every other mv_warp preset is **byte-identical by construction** (no shared engine/app/shader code was touched; the full 1388-test engine suite + `PresetRegressionTests` are green; the D-137 beachball risk is moot because no shared format/binding/transfer changed).

**Deferred to Skein.1 (flagged, not done here).** (a) **[RESOLVED by D-143, Skein.ENGINE.1.1.]** The app overloads "has a scene-geometry pipeline ⟹ Dragon Bloom `chromatic=1.0` + comp invert/echo/gamma" (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift:381-399`), and `PresetLoader.makeSceneGeometryPipeline` hard-codes the `dragon_bloom_strand_*` function names (`PresetLoader.swift:852`); when Skein.1 adds marks-on-top, both must be de-entangled per-preset. (b) Skein is the first **light-canvas** preset, so the design's "ground stays light" (§1.2) is in genuine tension with the white playback chrome — a bright cream ground drops white-text WCAG contrast to ~4.23:1 (`PresetContrastCertificationTests`). ENGINE.1 uses a darkened *toned-ground* placeholder to clear the gate; the real resolution (darker chrome backdrop for light presets, dark chrome text, or a toned ground) is a Skein.1+ palette/UX decision. (c) `family: painterly` (+ the `PresetCategory` enum case) is a product-taxonomy decision deferred to Skein.1; ENGINE.1 ships Skein with no `family` (nil is valid — SpectralCartograph / Staged Sandbox precedent).

## D-143 — Marks-on-top + per-preset canvas-clear are CONFIG of the mv_warp brush-on-feedback paradigm (Skein.ENGINE.1.1, 2026-06-05)

**Date:** 2026-06-05. **Status:** implemented (Skein.ENGINE.1.1); pending Matt's sign-off (the increment gate). Clears the "Deferred to Skein.1 (a)" de-entanglement D-142 flagged, and makes Skein **render live for the first time**.

**Context.** D-142 established canvas-hold as the no-decay / identity CONFIG of the mv_warp brush-on-feedback paradigm (D-135 / D-138) but noted the marks-on-top half (D-138 "marks composited normal-alpha on top of the held frame") was still hard-wired to Dragon Bloom in three places — so Skein, though it shipped the canvas-hold recipe, **could not draw a single mark** and the marks-on-top path produced a **black** canvas (no cream ground). The three couplings (verified file:line in the ENGINE.1.1 audit):
1. `PresetLoader.makeSceneGeometryPipeline` hard-coded `dragon_bloom_strand_vertex/_fragment` — every other preset got `sceneGeometryState = nil` → no marks. (Its doc comment also stale-claimed "additive blend"; the code is **normal alpha**.)
2. The app `.mvWarp` apply branch keyed ALL of `setMVWarpChromatic(1.0)` + `setMVWarpPost(invert 1 / echo 0.5 / gamma 1.07)` + `setSceneGeometry(…1536/3/lineStrip)` — and, in the render loop, the comp **beat pump** — on `sceneGeometryState != nil`. Any marks preset inherited Dragon Bloom's colour-cycling + comp + draw params + beat pump.
3. The mv_warp canvas clear (`clearWarpTexturesToBlack`) was hard-coded black; on the marks-on-top path Pass 0 (the background fragment) is **skipped** (`drawWithMVWarp`), so a marks preset's ground could only be black.

**Decision.** The D-138 marks-on-top mechanism is now reachable by ANY mv_warp preset as pure per-preset CONFIG — no new engine pass — generalising D-138 the way D-142 generalised D-135's feedback loop. Dragon Bloom is one instance, Skein another:
- **Geometry functions** resolve per-prefix (`<prefix>_geometry_vertex/_fragment`, prefix from `fragment_function`), mirroring the `<prefix>_warp_fragment` precedent (D-139). Dragon Bloom keeps `dragon_bloom_strand_*` via a legacy fallback (its library is the only one that defines those symbols) → byte-identical; presets without overlay functions still get `nil`.
- **Draw params + chromatic + comp + beat pump** come from a new optional **`marks` descriptor block** (`vertex_count`, `instance_count`, `primitive`, `chromatic`, `comp{invert,echo,gamma}`, `beat_pulse`). The app reads it when a preset has a geometry overlay. Dragon Bloom's block carries its exact prior literals verbatim → byte-identical. The comp beat pump is now gated by `marks.beat_pulse` (was `sceneGeometryState != nil`); Dragon Bloom is the only `strandsOnTop` preset today, so all existing presets are byte-identical.
- **Canvas clear colour** is per-preset on `MVWarpPipelineBundle` / `MVWarpState` → `clearWarpTextures(to:)`, sourced from `marks.canvas_clear` (linear RGB; omitted → black). Black for every existing preset → byte-identical; Skein clears to its cream ground (carried across drawable-resize on `MVWarpState`).

Every other mv_warp preset (Fata Morgana, Gossamer) has no geometry overlay → the `else` branch → chromatic 0 + comp identity + black clear, exactly as before. **Gated byte-identical:** `PresetRegressionTests` + `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest` + `FataMorganaMVWarpAccumulationTest` green; no shared mv_warp format/transfer/binding changed (the D-137 beachball risk is moot).

**Skein renders live.** `skein_fragment` is now the flat cream/toned GROUND only; the fixed test disc moved to a `skein_geometry_*` fullscreen-triangle overlay drawn normal-alpha on top with `chromatic=0`. Live, the ground comes from the per-preset canvas clear (Pass 0 skipped) and the disc from the overlay each frame; identity warp + no decay hold it losslessly. The disc is **hard-edged** so the per-frame redraw is idempotent (a partial-alpha AA fringe would re-blend toward teal every frame and creep for hundreds of frames; real Skein.1 marks are drawn once as the painter moves, so they keep their AA). `SkeinCanvasHoldTest`'s marks-on-top test proves — through the live scene→warp→overlay→blit→swap path — that the disc lands on a **cream** (not black) ground, `chromatic=0` holds **whole-frame Hamming-0 across 130 frames** while a `chromatic=1.0` control cycles, and the DB/FM accumulation tests stay green.

**Acceptance/Contrast.** Skein joins the Dragon-Bloom / Fata-Morgana **readable-form** exemption (its readable content is the overlay, invisible to the fragment-only harness). It is **not** exempted from non-black / no-white-clip / contrast — its cream ground genuinely passes those (white-text WCAG ≈ 4.9:1 on the toned ground). The light-ground-vs-white-chrome tension D-142(b) flagged remains a Skein.1+ palette/UX decision; `family: painterly` (D-142(c)) remains deferred.

**Deferred (unchanged).** The wandering painter + swept-capsule pour (marks that ACCUMULATE a line) are Skein.1 — ENGINE.1.1 ships only the static test disc through the now-wired overlay. Palette/UX (b) and `family` (c) per D-142.

**References.** `PresetLoader.makeSceneGeometryPipeline`; `PresetDescriptor.MarksConfig`; `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` `.mvWarp` branch + `mvWarpMarksPrimitive`; `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` (`clearWarpTextures`, beat-pump gate); `RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` (`setMVWarpPost beatPulse:`); `MVWarpTypes.swift` (`canvasClearColor`); `Skein.metal` / `Skein.json` (`marks` block); `SkeinCanvasHoldTest`. Supersedes D-142's "Deferred to Skein.1 (a)".

## D-145 — Nimbus beat-grid live phase: deferred to its own project (number reserved at the NB renumbering; entry filed retroactively at DOC.4)

**Date:** 2026-06-05 (reserved) / 2026-06-11 (filed) · **Increment:** NB.9 cert review · **Status:** Accepted — the deferral stands; the project has not started

> **DOC.4 integrity note (2026-06-11):** the number was claimed at the 2026-06-05 renumbering ("the beat-grid project moved to D-144 / D-145" — see D-144's header note) and has been cited ever since (D-144, FidelityRubricTests' Nimbus cert comment, memory), but the entry itself was never written. This retroactive stub records the decision as it was made so the citations resolve; it adds nothing not already decided.

**Decision.** Nimbus's M7 surfaced two findings; the mood half became D-144. The beat half — the cached beat grid's live phase is unreliable at track start (the FA #69 / Cold-Start Phase Contract structural limit) — is NOT a Nimbus defect and was deferred to its own future project, accepted as a known limitation at Nimbus certification. Any such project starts from the Cold-Start Phase Contract's premise constraints (human-tap reference / full-track local-file analysis / manual calibration — never another short-window signal).

## D-146 — BUG-027 fix scope: per-band EMA pivot on the FeatureVector band deviation (mirror the stem path); document the stem-energy offset (AGC2.2)

**Date:** 2026-06-05. **Status:** decided (Matt's AGC2.2 call); implementation = AGC2.3; validation + catalog M7 = AGC2.4. Refines D-026 (the deviation-primitive contract).

**Context.** BUG-027: the `FeatureVector` positive deviation primitives (`bassDev`/`midDev`/`trebDev`) are derived against a **fixed 0.5 pivot** (`MIRPipeline.swift:334-339`), but the AGC normalises the **total 6-band energy** to 0.5 (`BandEnergyProcessor.swift:204,213`), so each band centres at `0.5 × its fraction of total` — well below 0.5 for any non-dominant band. AGC2.1 measured the consequence on 4 real sessions, both capture paths, 4 spectral classes (`docs/diagnostics/AGC2_1_DEVIATION_CENTRING_2026-06-05.md`).

**Evidence (AGC2.1).** `bassDev` fires 2–8 % of active frames; **`midDev`/`trebDev` fire ~0 % on every session, both paths — including a genuinely mid-rich acoustic track (Elliott Smith) and a treble-rich jazz track (Mingus)**; the mid band's centre rises 0.03 → 0.10 with spectral focus but never nears 0.5. Structural, not genre-correlated. The **stem** deviation path fires 56–77 % because it already pivots on a **per-stem EMA** (`StemAnalyzer.swift:277-298`), not a fixed 0.5 — the working pattern ships side-by-side with the broken one. Raw `{stem}Energy` centres ~0.25–0.45 (≠ 0.5), which bites consumers reading the raw value (Nimbus `bloom`, D-144 r1.6).

**Decision (Matt's call — "fix band cue, document stems").**
1. **FeatureVector band path — engine fix.** Replace the fixed-0.5 pivot with a **per-band reference that tracks each band's own recent level**, mirroring `StemAnalyzer`'s per-stem EMA (seed-from-first-non-zero per SAR.1; reset on track change). `bassRel/midRel/trebRel` (and the `*AttRel` family) become "relative to this band's own average," and `*Dev = max(0, rel)` fires when the band is above its own norm — **alive for every band**. The **total-energy AGC is untouched**: raw `f.bass/f.mid/f.treble` and the cross-band relative-energy information are unchanged, so non-deviation consumers and the overall "look" are unaffected. The exact normalisation (additive `(x − avg)·2` vs a scale-free relative form) is an AGC2.3 detail, settled against the recorded sessions to guarantee both firing (the ≥ 20 % gate) and usable amplitude across bass/mid/treble; the default is to mirror the stem path.
2. **Stem path — no engine change + documentation.** The stem *deviation* path is already correct (per-stem EMA, fires 56–77 %) — leave it. Document the raw `{stem}Energy` ~0.30 centre as an authoring fact and recalibrate the few consumers that read the raw value per-consumer (Nimbus already did, D-144 r1.6). Capture in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §14.1`.

**Rejected.**
- **(a) Per-band AGC** (each band its own AGC denominator → band value centres 0.5): also changes the raw band *values* every preset reads (`f.treble` baseline 0.005 → 0.5) and **erases the "which band dominates" information** the 6-band total-energy AGC deliberately preserves (`BandEnergyProcessor.swift:40,122`). Largest blast radius; rejected for collateral on non-deviation consumers and on the catalog's baseline look.
- **(c) Document only:** leaves mid/treble "punch" unavailable to every preset — even the signed `midRel` centres −0.87, so the signed form is also weak for mid/treble. Rejected as it permanently caps the catalog's per-band reactivity.

**Consequences.**
- `RelDevTests`' formula pin (`bassRel == (bass − 0.5)·2`) is **deliberately updated** in AGC2.3 to the new EMA-relative semantics (signed `*Rel` now centres ~0), with the rationale in the diff — never edited silently to green a red bar.
- The positive deviation cue moves from "fires rarely on a strong transient (~3 %)" to "fires when above the band's own average (~50 %)" — the *intended* D-026 behaviour, but a real change in feel for any preset implicitly relying on the rare firing. **`PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes shift across the 11 deviation-consuming presets; surfaced + re-banked with Matt's approval at AGC2.4, alongside a catalog M7 on both paths.**
- Mid/treble `*Dev` remain quieter in absolute terms than `bassDev` (those bands are quieter post-AGC); authors driving motion from `midDev`/`trebDev` may need a larger gain than for `bassDev` — documented in `SHADER_CRAFT.md §14.1`.

**References.** BUG-027 (`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`); AGC2.1 evidence (`docs/diagnostics/AGC2_1_DEVIATION_CENTRING_2026-06-05.md`); D-026 (deviation-primitive contract this refines); D-144 r1.6 (manifestation-B preset-scope band-aid); Failed Approach #31 (absolute thresholds on AGC values — same family).

**AMENDED — implemented (AGC2.3 → 2.5, 2026-06-06).** Landed as the **additive** per-band EMA (`BandDeviationTracker`); the scale-free form was rejected at AGC2.3 (prototype: unbounded spikes, e.g. bass dev p90 reached 7.2). No golden-hash drift (the regression fixtures feed hand-built FeatureVectors, bypassing the live derivation). A cold-start **two-speed warmup + value ceiling** was added in **AGC2.4.1** after the M7 found the per-band EMA seeded from the session-start AGC spike and — since `MIRPipeline.reset()` is never called per track — stayed poisoned ~3-4 min; a live-path test now guards it (FA #66). BUG-027 marked **Resolved**. The AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike itself (which pops/drops continuous-energy presets like Ferrofluid Ocean) was split out as **BUG-029** — it is *not* a deviation issue and AGC2's warmup does not touch `f.bass`.

## D-147 — Skein.ENGINE.1.2 (gated slot-6 marks-on-top buffer) + the Skein.3 stem→colour contract

**Date:** 2026-06-05. **Status:** decided + implemented (Skein.3). Palette signed off by Matt. Consumes D-135 / D-138 (brush-on-feedback), D-142 / D-143 (canvas-hold + per-preset marks-on-top), D-026 (deviation primitives), D-019 (stem warmup).

**Context.** Skein.1/2 stayed pure closed-form (Path A) and deferred the CPU-side `SkeinState` + a per-preset overlay buffer to "ENGINE.1.2, when the stateful painter genuinely needs it." Skein.3 (per-mark stem colour frozen at lay-time, onset-driven burst spawning, per-track seed, per-stem flow integrators) is that consumer — none of it is synthesizable in the closed-form fragment.

**The ENGINE.1.2 decision (audit-driven — Option A unavailable).** The prompt hypothesized Option A (pure config: the slot-6 `directPresetFragmentBuffer` already reaches the overlay fragment). The audit **falsified it** with file:line evidence: Skein renders via the marks-on-top `strandsOnTop` branch (`RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift:212`), which **skips** `renderSceneToTexture` (`:217`) — the *only* site that binds fragment slot 6 (`RenderPipeline+MVWarpScene.swift:43-44`, for Gossamer/Arachne *scene* fragments). Pass 2's `strandsOnTop` branch (`encodeMVWarpScenePass:77-79`) calls `drawSceneGeometryOverlay`, which binds only `features`@vtx0 + `stems`@vtx1 (`RenderPipeline+SceneGeometry.swift:36-37`) — **no fragment buffer**. So the overlay fragment could not see slot 6 on this path. **Decision: Option B (gated binding), the lightest form** — a gated `if let presetBuf = directPresetFragmentBuffer { setFragmentBuffer(index:6) }` in the `strandsOnTop` branch, affecting only Dragon Bloom + Skein. **Byte-identical:** Dragon Bloom sets no `directPresetFragmentBuffer` (nil → no bind); Fata Morgana uses its own `renderFataMorgana` branch (never reaches `encodeMVWarpScenePass`). `SkeinState.swift` follows the established `GossamerState` pattern (no engine touch beyond the one gated binding).

**The Skein.3 stem→colour contract.**
1. **One stable, well-separated, vivid colour per stem over cream** (drums / bass / vocals / harmonic-other). Palette is **open** (legibility, not specific hues, is the binding constraint — README); Matt signed off on **Full Fathom Five** (charcoal / oxblood / ochre / teal) 2026-06-05.
2. **Opaque compositing, never mud.** The fragment outputs the **topmost** mark's colour (paired `bestCover`/`bestCol` max), never a blend of two stem colours (the dead-mat anti-ref). Each onset burst is mono-colour, frozen at its stem at lay-time.
3. **Per-stem onset = `*_energy_dev` activity, not `*_beat`.** Only `drums_beat` is a real pulse; the other `*_beat` are reserved-zero. Onsets derive from rising activity on each stem's `*_energy_dev` (D-026) in CPU state — the history the closed-form fragment cannot see. Throttled-while-active (refractory-limited), not rising-edge-only, so sparse real onsets still lay enough colour to read.
4. **Dominant-stem line colour = discrete argmax** of smoothed per-stem energy_dev (never a colour-space EMA, which passes through the mud midpoint).
5. **sRGB decode (FA #71).** The `.bgra8Unorm_srgb` canvas sRGB-encodes on store, so the palette is treated as display-space and sRGB-**decoded** to linear before packing — without it, dark stems lift to washed mid-tones and become unreadable (measured: drums/bass painted 0 → 933/2905 after the decode).
6. **§1.5 track-change reset.** A new track paints its own canvas: reseed the painter from the new track identity (FNV-1a title|artist — same track → same painting, §5.7) and wipe the canvas to cream (`clearMVWarpCanvasToGround`, gated to Skein).

**Rejected.** **(Option A)** pure config — empirically unavailable (the overlay fragment never sees slot 6 on the strandsOnTop path). **(Mood/structure/anticipation in Skein.3)** out of scope (Skein.5); no valence/arousal written anywhere (FA #25). **(`*_beat` for per-stem onsets)** only drums_beat is real.

**Consequences.**
- `SkeinState` is the sixth `*State.swift` (registry). The gated slot-6 binding is now a registry capability ("per-preset fragment buffer reaching the marks-on-top overlay fragment").
- Route-firing evidence (PresetSessionReplay, real Mingus session): drums 55.7 % / bass 30.4 % / vocals 68.7 % / harmony 68.4 % / energy 77.9 %. Viscosity ← centroid and flick-sharpness ← attackRatio are **not SR.1-measurable** (SessionFrame records no centroid/attackRatio) — stated, not asserted (PT.1).
- `family: painterly` + the `PresetCategory` case + cert (`certified`, `rubric_profile`) remain deferred to Skein.6.

## D-148 — BUG-029 fix approach: ease the AGC loudness meter in at each track start (seed-from-first-audible + hold-through-silence); AGC3.2

**Date:** 2026-06-05. **Status:** decided (Matt's AGC3.2 call); implementation = AGC3.3; validation + catalog M7 = AGC3.4. Sibling of D-146 (the AGC2 deviation fix) — both are cold-start fixes touching the `BandEnergyProcessor` family, at different layers (D-146 = the deviation EMA pivot; D-148 = the AGC band values themselves).

**Context.** BUG-029: at every track onset preceded by silence, `BandEnergyProcessor`'s total-energy AGC denominator (`agcRunningAvg`, which is *not* reset per track) has decayed toward zero across the inter-track silence — or seeded at `1e-6` off the session-start pre-roll — so the first audible frame over-scales and `f.bass` spikes to an absolute ~3.5–4.0 (steady ~0.25 = 11–17×). Continuous-energy presets reading `f.bass` directly (Ferrofluid Ocean's `1.0 + 0.8·clamp(f.bass,0,1)`) pop to their clamp ceiling then collapse. AGC3.1 measured it on a real 5-track LF session (`tools/agc3/measure_coldstart_spike.py`; `docs/diagnostics/AGC3_1_COLDSTART_SPIKE_2026-06-05.md`).

**Evidence (AGC3.1).** The spike is **per-track** (not one-time — refutes the BUG-025 shelving premise), gated by the silent pre-roll (every onset with *any* gap spiked; the one zero-gap onset did not); the **inter-track** instances last *longer* (0.9–1.2 s, slow AGC rate) than session-start (0.10 s, fast warmup); `fo_spike_strength` pins to 1.800 (+40–55 % height pop). The per-stem path does **not** spike because `StemAnalyzer.reset()` re-seeds each stem's processor per track — a working in-codebase precedent.

**Decision (Matt's call — option (a), "ease the meter in per track").** Smooth the arrival by easing the loudness meter into each track instead of cold-starting and over-reacting to the first sound. Implementation (AGC3.3, Claude's engineering choice *within* (a)) touches **only** cold-start/silence inside `BandEnergyProcessor`:
1. **Seed-from-first-audible.** Defer the AGC seed until the first frame with non-zero energy (don't seed `1e-6` off leading silence). The first audible frame seeds `agcRunningAvg` from its own energy → the meter starts at a sane level (slightly muted on a loud onset transient) and eases to steady, instead of dividing by ~0. Mirrors `StemAnalyzer` / SAR.1 / `BandDeviationTracker`.
2. **Hold-through-silence.** When a frame is near-silent *relative to the running average* (`totalRawEnergy < 0.02·agcRunningAvg`), hold the running average instead of decaying it toward zero. So an inter-track silence no longer leaves a tiny denominator for the next onset to over-scale against. Output is ~0 during the silence either way.

**Steady-state guarantee.** For continuous audible input (frame-0 energy > `1e-6`, no sub-2 % frames) the code path is **byte-identical** to the prior algorithm — same seed, same EMA, same rate schedule — so the total-energy AGC's mix-density-stability response (D-026) is untouched. Behaviour changes **only** at/below the near-silence floor (where output is ~0) and in the immediate post-silence ease-in window. A live-path test reproduces the spike un-fixed and asserts it gone (FA #66).

**Rejected.**
- **(b) Cap the jump at track start** — clip the over-reaction without easing in. Simpler, but the first loud hit still reads strong (just not a full white-out); less smooth than (a). The AGC3.1 evidence (per-track recurrence; the longer inter-track instances) favours the smoother arrival.
- **(c) Per-preset** — each preset softens its own track-start response. No shared-engine risk, but every author must remember it forever and shipped presets stay un-fixed; the evidence shows the artifact is at the shared-meter source, where one fix benefits every `f.bass` consumer.

**Consequences.**
- Touches the shared loudness meter feeding every preset + the deviation primitives → catalog M7 on both paths at AGC3.4 (Ferrofluid Ocean first), even though the change is cold-start-only.
- The per-stem `BandEnergyProcessor` gets the same change; BUG-018 (stem cold-start deviation ceiling — a separate StemAnalyzer-layer seed) must stay green; verified at AGC3.3.
- `PresetRegressionTests` golden hashes feed hand-built FeatureVectors (bypass the live AGC) → expected no drift; verified at AGC3.4.
- Streaming-path validation deferred to the AGC3.4 M7 (no streaming multi-track session existed at AGC3.1; the session-start mode is path-independent, the inter-track mode depends on the source app's gap).

## D-149 — Skein.ENGINE.2 wetness channel: the canvas ALPHA carries decaying wetness (approach A), read by a Skein-owned comp fragment (Skein.4 sheen)

**Date:** 2026-06-08. **Status:** decided + landed (Skein.ENGINE.2 + Skein.4; commits `255fcc64`/`c5192d28`/`ba62e1ef`/`23060d11`). The wet-now / dry-past legibility device (`SKEIN_DESIGN §1.4`): fresh paint glistens, the accumulated past is matte, so the eye tracks the musical *now*.

**Context.** Skein needs a transient per-pixel "wetness" signal — stamped to ~1 where paint lands this frame, decaying toward 0 each frame (the decay **pausing at silence**), readable at the display stage — to drive a wet specular highlight. The constraint: the canvas-hold **RGB is the lossless permanent paint record** (the ENGINE.1 Hamming-0 invariant); drying must be a **read-time effect on a separate channel**, never a destructive per-frame multiply on the RGB (`SKEIN_DESIGN §5.5`). And every other mv_warp preset must stay **byte-identical** (the D-137 preset-transition-beachball pitfall). The session prompt framed it as a cut-line: if ENGINE.2 needs more than a *gated additive signal + a gated read*, stop and certify matte-only.

**Decision — approach A (canvas ALPHA channel), in the cleanest form (Skein-owned fragments).** The audit found the per-prefix override mechanism (`PresetLoader.swift:689`/`:691`, used already by Fata Morgana) lets Skein own its warp + comp fragments **without touching one line of shared GPU code**:
1. **Storage = the feedback texture's ALPHA channel.** Skein's feedback is `.bgra8Unorm_srgb`, whose **alpha is linear 8-bit** (sRGB encodes RGB only) — ideal for wetness. RGB stays the lossless permanent paint record.
2. **Stamp = the existing overlay's alpha-over blend.** `skein_geometry_fragment` already returns `float4(bestCol, bestCover)`; the overlay blend is `.add` / `sourceAlpha` / `oneMinusSourceAlpha` on **both** colour AND alpha (`RenderPipeline+SceneGeometry.swift` / `PresetLoader.swift:886`) → solid fresh paint stamps A→1. **No new stamp code.**
3. **Decay = `skein_warp_fragment`** (the `<prefix>_warp_fragment` override): holds RGB **byte-identically** (identity sample — the same RGB the shared `mvWarp_fragment` produced) and decays A by `wetnessDecay` each frame. **Pauses at silence:** `wetnessDecay = exp(-rate·dt·stemMix)` from `SkeinState` (the `accumulated_audio_time` semantics — at silence stemMix→0 → factor→1 → wetness holds). **Not a new audio primitive** — reuses the existing silence gate (FA #67).
4. **Read = `skein_comp_fragment`** (the `<prefix>_comp_fragment` override): reads canvas RGB + wetness A from the already-bound compose texture and renders the wet/dry sheen (Skein.4: GGX specular gated by wetness, normal from the canvas luminance gradient, dry → matte+desaturate). **No new blit binding.**

Plumbing: one gated `mvWarpWetnessDecay` uniform (mirror of `mvWarpChromatic`), bound at warp-fragment `buffer(1)`, default 1.0; only `skein_warp_fragment` declares buffer(1), so the shared `mvWarp_fragment` ignores it and FM never runs the standard warp pass → **byte-identical for every other preset by construction**.

**Rejected — approach B (dedicated R8 ping-pong texture).** The plan's fallback. It keeps the RGB hold provably intact too, but needs a new texture + a stamp mechanism (the overlay writes RGBA to the compose texture, *not* a separate R8, so B forces MRT on the shared overlay pass that Dragon Bloom also runs, or a wasteful re-dispatch of the marks) + a decay pass + a gated blit binding. Approach A gives the same "read-time effect on a separate channel" (alpha *is* separate from RGB) with **no new texture, no new pass, and the shared `mvWarp_fragment` literally untouched** — strictly less code and less risk. The session prompt leaned B for "zero risk to the RGB hold," but A's RGB risk is also nil (Skein's RGB warp code is the identity sample), so A dominates.

**Cut-line: NOT invoked.** ENGINE.2 is a gated additive uniform + Skein-owned warp/comp fragments + a gated `.a` read — **no shared feedback-texture format change, no new render pass, no mv_warp loop reshape.** Skein certifies *with* the sheen (not matte-only).

**Consequences.**
- The `SkeinCanvasHoldTest` whole-canvas Hamming-0 lossless-hold check is re-scoped to **RGB-only** — the RGB channels are the lossless record; ALPHA legitimately carries decaying wetness (at silence it is held too). A new `SkeinWetnessTest` proves stamp≈1 / monotone decay under music / holds-at-silence through the live path.
- The Skein.4 sheen gates the specular on a **paint-present mask** (distance from the cream ground) so the bare canvas (whose A also seeds at 1 from the clear) reads matte — wet *paint*, not a wet *floor*.
- Bloom-on-wet-specular is deferred (it needs a pass / governor state at the blit); the in-shader glint gives the sparkle without a new pass (cut-line-conscious).
- DB/FM/Starburst byte-identical: `PresetRegressionTests` (20 presets × 3 conditions) + the DB/FM MVWarp accumulation suites green; `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` count intact.

## D-150 — Skein.4.1 colour-per-stroke: a colour-breakpoint ring freezes the pour-line colour per-segment and starts a displaced NEW pour on a dominant-stem switch

**Date:** 2026-06-09. **Status:** decided + landed (Skein.4.1; pending Matt's M7). **Defect (Matt M7, session `2026-06-09T14-19-14Z`):** "the colour of the line changes sometimes in the middle of a stroke. In reality, a new line in a different colour would appear because the painter needs to grab or use a new paint container."

**Context.** The pour LINE is redrawn closed-form every frame from the recent painter polyline (a ~40-frame tail, `skein_geometry_fragment` Layer A), coloured by a SINGLE `lineCol` = the current dominant stem (SkeinState discrete argmax). So when the dominant stem switches, the whole redrawn tail — the recent ~40 frames of already-laid line — recolours. The bursts were already correct (each `SkeinBurstGPU` freezes its stem colour at spawn); only the continuous line recoloured. **Matt's product call (option 2 over the simpler option 1):** a colour change should read as a genuinely NEW pour (the painter grabbing a new paint container), not a continuous line whose colour merely changes at a seam.

**Decision — a per-pour breakpoint ring in `SkeinUniforms` (approach A), carrying both a frozen colour AND a bounded position jump.** On each dominant-stem **change**, SkeinState pushes a breakpoint `(painterTau-at-change, new linear colour, new-pour offset)` into a small fixed ring (16 entries, evict-oldest), packed as an **additive tail** of the slot-6 `SkeinUniforms` buffer (`SkeinBreakGPU`, 24 B each, after the fixed `bursts[48]`; `pad0`→`breakCount`). The fragment, per tail sample, looks up the latest breakpoint with `tauStart ≤ sample-τ` (`skeinLineLookupAt`) → that sample's lay-time **colour + offset**:
1. **Colour freeze.** A tail segment laid before a switch keeps the old colour; one laid after gets the new. The already-baked canvas (held losslessly) was already correct — only the live tail recoloured, and now it does not.
2. **New pour (the jump).** Each breakpoint carries a small **bounded, non-cumulative** position offset — a fixed-magnitude (0.05 UV) vector rotated by the golden angle per switch (seeded → §5.7 determinism; non-cumulative → never drifts off canvas; golden-angle → consecutive pours always well-separated). The new-colour line is drawn at `painterPos + offset_new`, the old at `painterPos + offset_old`. The segment that would BRIDGE two different pours (different breakpoint `start`) is **not drawn** → a clean gap. So a colour change reads as the painter lifting and starting a fresh drip elsewhere. Bursts flick from the painter's jumped position too (their throw direction still from the un-offset path, so the jump never spikes it).

**Coverage is byte-identical to Skein.4's union SDF (no rings regression).** With ONE per-frame radius, `max over per-capsule coverage ≡ 1 − smoothstep(min segDist − r)` — so tracking the nearest *drawn* segment to pick its frozen colour does NOT change the coverage value. The M7-round-3/4 no-rings fix (one union SDF, one radius, blurred wetness) is untouched; `test_sheen_noConcentricRings` stays green (8.68 < 13).

**Rejected — option 1 (continuous path, colour frozen per-segment, no jump).** Simpler and lower-risk (it fixes the literal "recolours the whole stroke" complaint), but Matt's words ("a NEW line would appear") asked for a genuine new pour. A pure temporal gap (no jump) was also rejected: at slow/pooling movement neighbouring capsules overlap and FILL any same-path gap, so only a spatial jump reliably reads as a new pour at all speeds.

**Rejected — option B (per-frame colour written into the canvas, no history).** The tail is redrawn closed-form each frame; there is no single "lay frame" for a tail sample to write a colour into. The breakpoint ring is the clean way to know each sample's lay-time colour, exactly mirroring the per-burst colour freeze.

**Byte-identical guarantee.** `SkeinUniforms` is SkeinState's own slot-6 buffer; no other preset binds it. The MSL/Swift structs match byte-for-byte (the ring is an additive tail; `breakCount` reuses the former `pad0`). `PresetRegressionTests` (20 presets × 3 conditions) + the DB/FM MVWarp accumulation suites stay byte-identical; `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` count intact (no silent MSL drop, FA #72).

**Consequences.**
- At silence only the white baseline breakpoint exists (offset 0) → the byte-identical pre-4.1 continuous white line; the silence pour-line continuity gate stays 1.000.
- New gate `test_lineColorFreeze_keepsColourAndStartsNewPour` drives two ordered real-stem slices across a dominant switch through the live path and asserts the pre-switch line KEEPS its colour (X≫Y at the old offset), the post-switch line is the new colour (Y≫X at the new offset), and the new pour is displaced (a real jump; the new pour is at the jumped offset, not the un-jumped path).
- The continuous-path continuity invariant is now **per-pour**, not whole-tail (the line is intentionally broken at switches) — this only affects with-audio rendering; the gated continuity test runs at silence (one pour) and is unaffected.

**M7-round-2 (Matt, live, 2026-06-09, session `2026-06-09T16-23-21Z`): "the lines are very short rather than a long continuous dripping/pouring across the canvas." Added a minimum-pour dwell + hysteresis on the pour switch.** The pour COLOUR is the dominant-stem argmax, which flickers far faster than a pour can read — measured on the session: **63 dominant switches / 44 s, median pour 0.2 s (Δτ 0.34), 79 % under 0.5 s.** Each tiny pour, with the new-pour jump, became a short displaced segment instead of a long stroke. Fix: a new pour now COMMITS only on a *sustained, decisive* change — the current pour must have lasted `minPourTau = 3.0` τ (≈ half-a-canvas minimum at the trajectory's ~0.15 UV/τ; typical pours run longer), AND the challenger must lead the incumbent's smoothed energy by `pourSwitchHysteresis = 1.25×` (no flicker between near-equal stems). The first pour commits immediately; the **bursts still fire per-stem onset, ungated** (they are the accents). Validated on the session: **63 → 10 pours, ~4 s average.** The line colour/flow/viscosity now all follow the *committed* pour (not the instantaneous argmax), so each pour is coherent. This gates the existing dominant-switch event — **not a new audio route** (FA #67 holds). Side effect on the test surface: with long continuous lines the splatter droplets connect to the line (one >500 px component), so the `distinctBlobs` separable-satellite count is no longer a reliable gate (it was already session-fragile per `SHADER_CRAFT §18.8`) — demoted to a diagnostic; the onset→splatter firing is gated directly on the per-stem spawn tally + busy≫calm. The bake/hold check is now colour-agnostic (the longer first pour can be a low-spread stem like charcoal).

## D-151 — Skein.ENGINE.3: a gated `RenderPipeline.setStructuralPrediction` bridge delivers the live structural-section signal to the preset tick (CPU-only, byte-identical)

**Date:** 2026-06-09. **Status:** decided + landed (Skein.ENGINE.3, local `main`). **Type:** engine increment (a small gated analysis→render→tick channel). **Matt chose option (a)** at the Skein.5 scoping — a *deliberate engine increment* for real section-awareness over an in-state proxy / deferral, honouring infra-before-preset (FA #59/#60).

**Context.** The live `StructuralPrediction` (`{ sectionIndex, sectionStartTime, predictedNextBoundary, confidence }`, `MIRPipeline.latestStructuralPrediction`, refreshed per frame by `StructuralAnalyzer.process`) was DSP/orchestrator-only — it did not reach the preset tick. Skein.5's structure sub-feature needs it. The split (Skein.ENGINE.3 prerequisite of Skein.5) keeps the *signal plumbing* separate from the *visual bias* (never bundled — FA #59/#60).

**Decision — a separate, lock-guarded, default-inert store on `RenderPipeline`, mirroring the `setMood`/`latestFeatures` value-injection bridge (option (A)).** `RenderPipeline.setStructuralPrediction(_:)` writes a backing `storedStructuralPrediction` under a dedicated `structuralPredictionLock`; the lock-guarded computed `latestStructuralPrediction` (default `.none`) is the read accessor. `SkeinState.tick` gains a `structure: StructuralPrediction = .none` parameter; the Skein mesh-preset-tick closure (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`) reads `pipeline.latestStructuralPrediction` and passes it in. The `meshPresetTick` callback **type is unchanged** (`(FeatureVector, StemFeatures)`), so no other preset's wiring is touched → byte-identical by construction. CPU-only: structure is **NOT** a `FeatureVector`/`Common.metal` field (no D-099 migration) and is never written to the GPU buffer; `SkeinState` stores it in pure-CPU fields plus a one-frame `didCrossSectionBoundaryThisFrame` flag (set when `sectionIndex` changes; re-baselined on the first observation and on `reseed`).

**This increment delivers + proves the signal ONLY. The structural VISUAL (palette emphasis, pour density, region lean) is Skein.5** — the shipped behaviour after ENGINE.3 is **visually identical to today** (the signal is delivered but unused). That is the byte-identical guarantee in action.

**Call site — the per-frame MIR publish (`setFeatures` site), not the `setMood` site.** The setter is called from `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift` right after `pipeline.setFeatures(fv)` (where `mir.process` two lines above just refreshed `mir.latestStructuralPrediction`), **not** inside `publishMoodResult` alongside `setMood` as the session prompt's recon suggested. Rationale (the audit's deliberate refinement): the `setFeatures` site is **unconditional per-frame** — the `setMood` path early-returns when the mood classifier is absent or `classify` throws, which would intermittently stall the section signal — and structure is conceptually a per-frame MIR output (a sibling of `setFeatures`), not an accumulated mood-classifier result. Both honour the binding constraint (route through `RenderPipeline`; never read `mirPipeline` on the render thread). Resets to `.none` on preset switch (the `applyPreset` teardown, beside `setMVWarpWetnessDecay(1.0)`); track change is covered by the per-frame push (`MIRPipeline.reset` → `.none`) plus `SkeinState.reseed` clearing its own section tracking.

**Rejected — option (B): extend the `meshPresetTick` callback signature** to `(FeatureVector, StemFeatures, StructuralPrediction)`. Cleaner conceptually but touches `RenderPipeline` (the type), `+Draw` (the call), `+PresetSwitching` (the setter), both `VisualizerEngine*` wirings, `SkeinState`, and the test, and forces every future mesh-preset tick to carry structure — higher blast radius for no functional gain over (A), which is provably thread-safe (the `setMood` lock proves it).

**Byte-identical guarantee.** The setter defaults to `.none` and **only `SkeinState` reads it**; no shared GPU code, no feedback-format change, no `FeatureVector` change, no GPU buffer write. `PresetRegressionTests` (20 presets × 3 conditions) + the Dragon Bloom / Fata Morgana MVWarp accumulation suites stay byte-identical; `PresetLoaderCompileFailure` count intact (FA #72). Even Skein's own render is byte-identical: the stored structure lives in CPU-only fields that `writeToGPU` never touches.

**Consequences.**
- New gate `SkeinStructureSignalTests` (FA #66, live path): drives the real `setStructuralPrediction`/`latestStructuralPrediction` bridge on a real `RenderPipeline`, invokes the stored `meshPresetTick` exactly as `RenderPipeline+Draw.swift:120` does, and asserts the section index/confidence reach `SkeinState` and that a `sectionIndex` increment raises the boundary flag for exactly one frame; plus a `reseed`-clears-tracking gate.
- `SkeinState`'s structural accessors + the `ingestStructure` helper + the `centroid`/`attackRatio` per-stem accessors moved to a same-file extension to keep the class body within the SwiftLint `type_body_length` budget (the file's documented pattern).
- Skein.5's structure sub-feature now depends on this signal (it consumes `currentSectionIndex` / `didCrossSectionBoundaryThisFrame` / `sectionConfidence`, gated on `confidence`).

Skein.5 consumes it next.

## D-152 — Skein.5 musicality layer: mood frozen at lay-time, structure biased through pour offsets, anticipation as τ-warping, locus display-only

**Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Increment:** Skein.5 · **Status:** Ratified

**Decision.** The Skein.5 sub-features each route through a mechanism chosen so the lossless canvas-hold invariants survive:

1. **Mood is applied AT LAY TIME and frozen.** `SkeinState` EMA-smooths `features.valence/arousal` (τ = 4 s, FA #25 — never written back) and `moodTinted(_:)` warms/cools + saturates the LINEAR palette colour at the moment a breakpoint or burst is pushed. The tint is multiplicative on vivid colours (bounded ±18 % R / ∓16 % B, saturation floor 0.85) — never the `mix(cream, hue, sat)` anti-pattern — so the pale-tone ceiling is structurally safe (measured pale share 0.003). Because the canvas holds losslessly, lay-time freezing means **the finished painting archives the song's emotional arc** — a chorus's strokes stay warm after the song cools. Valence = 0 ⇒ exact identity (silence + all pre-Skein.5 tests byte-identical).
2. **The structural region lean routes through the existing per-pour breakpoint offsets** — never a per-frame displacement of the painter position. The closed-form tail is REDRAWN every frame, so any per-frame position modulation would repaint the 40-frame tail shifted (smear); a pour-start offset is captured once and frozen (the Skein.4.1 mechanism). On a confident boundary (`confidence` smoothstep-gated 0.25→0.55; below ⇒ exactly zero bias, the pure allover read): a density pulse (refractory ÷ (1 + 1.2·pulse), τ = 2.5 s decay), a boundary-forced fresh pour (floored at 1.0 τ dwell so D-150 long pours survive), and a lean target at `seed + (sectionIndex mod 5) · goldenAngle`, radius ≤ 0.085 UV, EMA-approached (τ = 2.5 s) — repeated section slots revisit the same patch and build density. Per-section warmth emphasis (± 0.10 valence-equivalent, alternating slot parity) rides the same gate.
3. **Anticipation is τ-speed warping** (FA #33 — beat PHASE, not onset): wind-up `1 − 0.45·smoothstep(0.70, 1, beatPhase01)`, flick release `+0.90·exp(−t/90 ms)` at the wrap. KEY property: τ-warping keeps every tail sample exactly ON the trajectory curve — samples move ALONG the curve, never laterally — so the held line cannot smear, by construction. `mix(1, factor, stemMix)` ⇒ exactly 1.0 at silence (the Skein.1 continuity gate byte-holds). Cold-start-safe: a wrong cached phase reads as a mistimed hesitation, not a wrong-beat firing.
4. **The locus is display-only at the comp stage.** The prompt's suggested site (`skein_geometry_fragment`) would BAKE the glow into the held canvas permanently; the correct site is `skein_comp_fragment` (display-only, the FA #70 contract). Plumbing: the blit pass gains a gated `bindCompStagePresetBuffer` (the slot-6 preset buffer at fragment buffer 1 — the ENGINE.2 inert-binding precedent; nil ⇒ nothing bound, every other preset byte-identical). The glow carries a soft occlusion shadow ring (an object hovering above a surface casts one) so it reads on cream AND on paint. Build-flagged via `SkeinState(locusEnabled:)`, default `false`; gate `test_locus_displayOnly` proves canvas byte-identical flag-on vs flag-off.

**FA #67 audit.** The painter MOTION path is ONE visual channel consuming three timescales (broadband-dev s-scale, arousal ~10 s envelope, beat-phase sub-s) — multiple timescales into one channel is allowed; the rule forbids one timescale into two channels. The splatter TRIGGER stays per-stem onset; arousal/pulse only scale its density envelope (the MM global-envelope lesson).

**Evidence (live path, real stems).** Mood: warmth(R−B) 106.4 warm vs 81.4 cool, coverage +24 % with +arousal, pale 0.003. Structure: spawns 88→144 across a boundary on IDENTICAL tiled audio; lean 0.083 ≤ 0.085; conf 0.05 ⇒ all-zero bias. Anticipation: wind-up mean 0.649 / flick mean 1.627; silence exactly 1.0 every frame. Locus: 24-pixel localized blit glow, canvas byte-identical. All prior Skein gates + DB/FM + PresetRegression + loader count green; BUG-035 fixed first so the consumed signal is sane past 600 frames.

**AMENDED 2026-06-09 (Skein.5.1, Matt M7 on session `2026-06-09T22-35-09Z`: "a different white line pattern at track start… white disturbs the colour palette").** The Skein.1-era white-baseline pour is retired: the breakpoint ring now starts EMPTY (no white baseline); the shader draws no line at all until the first coloured pour commits (`breakCount == 0` skips Layer A); the first commit waits a short settle (`firstPourSettleTau = 0.25` τ ≈ ¼ s of smoothed evidence — the D-150 decisiveness principle applied to the first commit, replacing the one-frame argmax that picked flicker colours) and then RETRO-COLOURS the whole pre-commit tail via `tauStart = 0` — the painting's first stroke appears already in the lead stem's colour, continuous from the start point (the first pour carries no jump; jumps separate pours and there is no previous pour). The painter CLOCK now pauses at true silence (`activity = max(stemMix, smoothstep(0.01, 0.04, fvEnergy))` multiplying paint speed — the wetness-pause semantics): no music, no paint; a mid-track pause freezes the painter instead of slowly drawing. The Skein.1 "white line accumulates at silence" invariant is deliberately retired; the inverted gates are `!hasWhiteTexel` (calm-stem + real-stem runs) and `silence-run painted == 0`. The white squiggle's root cause: at canvas birth most of the 40-frame tail resolved to the white-baseline era (including negative-ctau samples), baking a tail-length white piece the lossless canvas kept forever, displaced from the first coloured pour by its jump — different each track via the per-track seed.

## D-153 — FBS Stage 1: a steady, first-NOTE-anchored, cached-tempo beat pulse (`pulsePhase01`/`pulseAmp01`) drives Ferrofluid Ocean's spike punch; never drift-corrected

**Date:** 2026-06-09 · **Increment:** FBS Stage 1 · **Status:** Ratified (pending Matt's Stage-1 read on a live session)

**Decision.** FFO's spike height drops the `0.8 × clamp(f.bass)` per-frame term (the "frozen spikes" root cause — the AGC holds `f.bass` near-constant; motion std 0.044–0.09 on bass-light material — and the residual post-BUG-038 sparkle source) and instead punches on a new engine primitive, `BeatPulseClock` → `FeatureVector` floats 40–41 (reclaimed `_pad4`/`_pad5`, byte-identical layout for fields 1–39):

1. **Anchor = the track's first NOTE** (silence→sound, 3-frame confirm, backdated to the run's first frame) — Matt's correction over "first strong hit," Stage-0-verified: music starts on the one; the silence→signal transition is the cleanest detectable event and is robust to quiet/building intros. Cross-clock PCM gate: anchor lands ~2 ms from the raw-tap first note on the purpose-recorded Cherub session.
2. **Tempo = the cached BeatGrid BPM** — the trustworthy half of the grid (Stage 0: ~1 % err, reproducible ×6 captures). Grid PHASE is cross-capture-unstable and is NOT consumed.
3. **Dead steady, never corrected** — deliberately independent of `LiveBeatDriftTracker` (its correction wanders 50–90 ms over the opening and broke Love Rehab's good start). A steady pulse wrong-by-a-hair beats a wandering pulse right-on-average. Stage 3 may add a bar-boundary handoff; nothing corrects Stage 1.
4. **`pulseAmp01` gates** (0 before the first note / across > 0.5 s sustained silence; 1 while music plays; ~250 ms ramps) — no punching into a silent room. Stage 2 scales it by live energy.
5. **Envelope in the shader** (rise 8 % of the beat, decay to 85 %, rest): headroom-capped at spike strength 1.62, under the CSP.3.5 Lipschitz `/6` ceiling 1.64. One-primitive-per-layer preserved (FA #67): swell×arousal (slow), spikes×pulse (per-beat), aurora×drums-smoothed (hit envelope). No Layer-4 onset signals consumed (those fire ~97 % of frames — BUG-038's root).

**Evidence (real sessions, live dispatch path).** `BeatPulseClockTests` (9): anchor 2 ms vs PCM; every pulse interval == grid period (cumulative drift ~0 vs the tracker's 50–90 ms); envelope motion std 0.198/0.212/0.182 (Lotus/Cherub/SZ2) vs the old term's 0.044 on the frozen streaming case. `FerrofluidPulseLivePathTests`: 110 continuous frames of the real Lotus session through SDF G-buffer → lighting → bloom, paired per-frame A/B delta — punch-window |δ| = 29.3 luma, rest-window 0.0 (beat-locked, zero between-beat flicker by construction). Golden hashes unchanged; full suite green modulo the documented pre-existing set.

**Known limitations (stated, not hidden).** Mid-playlist gapless segues anchor at the track-change instant, not a musical "one" (best-effort); the anchored phase is perceptually-convincing, not provably the downbeat (FA #69's structural limit stands); the toggle off-arm no longer restores the historical `f.bass` drive (Layer 2 is the pulse in both arms).

**References.** FBS kickoff (`docs/prompts/FFO_BEAT_SYNC_KICKOFF.md`), Stage 0 findings (`docs/diagnostics/FBS_STAGE0_FINDINGS_2026-06-09.md`), BUG-038 (the flicker pre-step), FA #4/#27/#66/#67/#69, D-099 (struct-extension pattern), CSP.3.x (the spike-driver history this supersedes).

## D-154 — FBS course-correction: beat-irregular tracks are hard-excluded from beat-locked presets (FFO never sees them); the pulse becomes a SLOW 4-beat heave

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** FBS.S2 · **Status:** Ratified (Matt's product direction, 2026-06-10)

**Context.** The Stage-1 live verdict (session `2026-06-10T03-02-32Z`, addendum in `FBS_STAGE0_FINDINGS_2026-06-09.md`) was negative on a streaming playlist: the per-beat punch from an arbitrary anchor (gapless track switches) read as a robotic metronome, and Pyramid Song — rubato, no steady beat — regressed (confident regular thump on an irregular song). Matt also corrected scope: the pulse was always the COLD-START bridge, not the whole-track driver. His direction: *"Not all songs are a fit for FFO… exclude them, they should never see the FFO preset. Slow pulse probably works for (1). We can gradually improve… iteratively, incrementally over time."*

**Decision.**

1. **Beat-regularity hard exclusion at the preset picker.** `assessBeatIrregularity(gridBPM:drumsBPM:barConfidence:)` (Session/BPMMismatchCheck.swift): octave-folded disagreement between the full-mix and drums-stem Beat This! grids > 10 %, OR grid bar-confidence < 0.2, ⇒ irregular. Calibrated on the real cached catalog (38 tracks): kept tracks fold to ≤ 9.2 % (Love Rehab 0.7, There There 0.4, Money 0.6, Cherub 9.2); excluded ≥ 11.3 % (Pyramid 17.4, SZ2 11.3, Tras 3 13.3, Mingus 49). The MIR estimator is NOT consulted (it disagrees 8–11 % even on solid-beat tracks — cannot discriminate). Octave folding keeps legitimate half/double-time drum grids regular (119.8 vs 60.7 → 2.6 %). Plumbing: `TrackProfile.beatIrregular: Bool?` (optional — old persisted profiles decode as unknown) + `PresetDescriptor.requiresRegularBeat` (`requires_regular_beat`, set on FerrofluidOcean.json) + a `beat_irregular` hard exclusion in `DefaultPresetScorer`. Reaches ALL selection paths: planner (initial + regenerate), reactive (`evaluate(currentTrackBeatIrregular:)` — also evicts FFO if it is current when the gate fires), mood-override repatch (plan profile carries the flag). Manual preset selection is deliberately unaffected. nil/unknown = permissive — exclusion requires evidence.
2. **Slow pulse: the cycle is FOUR beats** (`BeatPulseClock.pulseBeats = 4`), ~2 s at 120 BPM. A per-beat punch from an arbitrary phase is maximally falsifiable; at 4-beat rate the same error reads as a gentle oceanic heave at a musical rate, and sub-1 % tempo error smears phase 4× slower. Fixed 4 beats, NOT the grid's detected meter (meter detection is itself unreliable; the pulse claims no downbeat alignment).
3. **Iterate incrementally** (Matt's framing): no big-bang handoff build; FFO improves over small increments, each with a live look.

**Known gaps (stated).** Swing feel is invisible to the gate — So What's estimators agree perfectly (135.5/135.5, conf 1.0) yet a metronome pulse isn't that song's pulse; catching it needs a different signal (future iteration). The Mingus track (Matt's best-performing for the OLD continuous-bass FFO) is excluded by the gate (49 % fold) — flagged to Matt explicitly. The 10 % threshold sits in a thin observed gap (9.2 vs 11.3) — tune as data accumulates.

**Evidence.** `BeatRegularityExclusionTests` (real catalog values; scorer + reactive exclusion; FFO sidecar flag gate). `BeatPulseClockTests` updated to the 4-beat period (all real-session gates still green: anchor 2 ms, zero wander, motion ≥ frozen baseline). `FerrofluidPulseLivePathTests` green with the slow pulse (punch |δ| = 31.1 luma, rest 0.0 through the live dispatch). Full suite: only the documented timing flakes (SoakTestHarness / MetadataPreFetcher wall-clock budgets under parallel load — both pass isolated).

> **AMENDED 2026-06-11 (FBS.S5c — the FFO ban is RETIRED).** Matt watched FFO on Pyramid Song — the gate's canonical catch — in session `2026-06-11T01-56-22Z` and ruled: *"Remove the FFO ban for Pyramid Song - it looks and moves great!"* Asked retire-entirely vs soften-to-preference; **Matt picked retire entirely.** The session data explains why the ban's premise failed: the live drift tracker **LOCKED on Pyramid at te 5.4 s** (faster than any regular track that session; locked for 61 % of the segment) — the 47.7 % grid-vs-drums disagreement that flagged the track condemned the drums-stem estimate, not the 70 BPM grid FFO actually uses (Pyramid genuinely sits at ~68–70 BPM). Both gate catches Matt has watched (Pyramid, Mingus) looked good, and the post-D-156/157/158 FFO degrades gracefully on unreliable beats (gentle global heave; per-beat punches only after lock or the 10 s window). **Implementation:** `requires_regular_beat` removed from `FerrofluidOcean.json` — no production preset declares it. The MECHANISM (descriptor flag, scorer/planner/reactive hard exclusion, `assessBeatIrregularity` → `TrackProfile.beatIrregular` signal) stays, tested via synthetic presets, available to future presets and as diagnostic data. `test_realFFOSidecar_doesNotDeclareRequiresRegularBeat` pins the retirement — re-adding the flag to FFO requires a new product decision. The D-154 known-gaps list (swing invisibility, threshold tuning) is moot for FFO while no preset declares the flag.

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** Skein.5.3 · **Status:** Ratified (Matt's curation + picker choice, 2026-06-10)

**Decision.** Skein paints each track in ONE palette chosen from a curated library, replacing the single Full Fathom Five register:

1. **The library** (`SkeinPaletteLibrary.candidates`, display sRGB): `fathom` (the shipped default, index 0), `nocturne` (ink blue-black / deep violet / moonlit gold / ice blue), `jewel` (deep violet / crimson / saffron / emerald), `inkpop` (near-black / cobalt / hot orange / magenta), `electric` (violet charcoal / magenta / acid orange / cyan). Matt curated from six rendered candidates on identical seed-0 real-stem paintings; `terra` (umber/rust/gold/sage) was cut.
2. **Fixed role grammar** — in EVERY palette: drums = the darkest ink, bass = the deep heavy saturated weight, vocals = the warm bright lead, other = the contrast accent. The colour→stem vocabulary stays learnable across palettes even as hues change (the trade-off that otherwise argues against a library).
3. **Picker = per-track, deterministic** (Matt's choice over mood-matched): `SkeinPaletteLibrary.entry(forTrackSeed:)` = `seed % count`, fed by the SAME FNV-1a track identity that seeds the painter trajectory — the same song always paints the same painting in the same colours (§5.7 extends to colour), and a playlist rotates the library naturally. LIBRARY MODE engages only when `SkeinState` is constructed without an explicit palette (the live app path); explicit palettes (every test fixture, the contact-sheet candidates) stay pinned forever, and `reseed` re-picks only in library mode. Seed 0 → `fathom`, so all no-palette fixtures are byte-identical to pre-library behaviour.
4. **Curation gates** (`SkeinPaletteLibraryTests`, always-on): every entry stays pairwise-separable — including vs the cream ground — at the rendered-display level across the FULL Skein.5 mood-tint swing (valence −1…+1 through the EXACT production transform, `SkeinState.moodTint` extracted static for this); pale-tone ceiling per ink; role grammar (drums darkest); `fathom == defaultPalette` byte-equality; picker determinism + reseed re-pick + explicit-mode pinning.

**Trade-off accepted.** Per-palette character variation (e.g. nocturne's violet bass vs fathom's oxblood) means M7/cert evidence must sample multiple palettes; Skein.6's ≥5-track M7 naturally covers ≥5 palette draws via distinct tracks.

## D-156 — FBS.S3: after ~10 s the pulse hands off invisibly to the live drift-tracker beat (per-beat punches — the energetic steady state); the slow bridge covers only the opening

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** FBS.S3 · **Status:** Ratified (implements Matt's "slow pulse for the start… we need something more energetic" direction, 2026-06-10)

**Decision.** `BeatPulseClock` becomes a two-state machine:

1. **Bridge (track open):** unchanged D-153/D-154 behaviour — first-note anchor, cached tempo, slow 4-beat heave, never corrected. Covers the window where the live tracker wanders and the stems converge.
2. **Handoff (once, per track):** after `handoffAfterS` (10 s) past the anchor, the pulse swaps its phase source to `LiveBeatDriftTracker`'s per-beat `beatPhase01` — but ONLY at a frame where BOTH the outgoing bridge phase and the incoming live phase sit in the punch envelope's REST window (≥ 0.85 of the cycle, where the envelope is zero — the constant mirrors the decay-end in `fo_spike_strength`; both sides are cross-annotated). The envelope is zero on each side of the swap ⇒ **the seam is invisible by construction**, no crossfade needed.
3. **Steady state:** per-beat punches following the live beat — including its small continuous corrections, which at punch rate read as timing breath, not stutter (the gross corrections happen in the opening, which the bridge covers). Grid cleared mid-track ⇒ falls back to the bridge metronome rather than going dark. `resetAnchor()` (track change) returns to the bridge, so every track re-opens slow.

Reactive mode with no grid: no live phase is offered, the bridge keeps running (no handoff). The MIRPipeline pulse update moves AFTER the drift-tracker block so the live phase is current-frame.

**Evidence (real session replay, `loverehab_handoff_2026-06-10T14-55-32Z` fixture — 40 s of Love Rehab with the recorded live `beatPhase01`).** `test_handoff_swapsToLiveBeat_invisibly_onRealSession`: handoff fires ≥ 10 s, in the rest window on both sides; post-handoff phase equals the recorded live phase exactly; the envelope's max frame-to-frame step around the swap stays within its natural attack slope (bound 0.65 — sized for real frame-time jitter; a bad mid-punch swap would step ≈ 1.0); the bridge ticked at exactly the slow 4-beat period before the swap. Plus no-grid/no-handoff and per-track reset gates. Live-path GPU suite green.

**Known risk (stated).** The steady state inherits the live tracker's quality: on tracks where its phase is wrong or breathing visibly, the per-beat punches will show that. That is the next live read's question — and the gate (D-154) already keeps the worst tracks (beat-irregular) off FFO entirely.

**AMENDED 2026-06-10 (Skein.5.3b — Matt's round-1 curation rejection + round-2 re-curation).** Round 1 was rejected on process and content: the candidates were invented hue sets (not AbEx-anchored), all shared a warm-gold lead (too similar), "nocturne" wasn't cool, and the canvas GROUND had been held fixed silently — "Why does the background color of the canvas need to be beige for all color palettes?" The redo: (1) **the ground is part of the palette** — `Entry.ground`, plumbed end-to-end (SkeinState carries + re-picks it per track; a `float4` LINEAR ground rides the slot-6 buffer as a second additive tail at offset 2752 so the comp paint-mask tracks it; a gated `mvWarpCanvasGroundOverride` makes the canvas wipe AND the resize re-clear use the track's ground; nil ⇒ byte-identical for every other preset); (2) **every entry is anchored on a NAMED work** (`Entry.anchor`); (3) the role grammar generalises to *drums = the starkest structural ink VS THE GROUND* (black on light, bone on dark); (4) gates are ground-aware (separability vs THIS entry's ground across the mood swing — caught two real collisions during tuning; grounds decisively light/dark; ≤1 pale highlight ink). **Final Matt-curated library (round 2): `fathom` (Full Fathom Five, cream) + `poles` (Blue Poles, dark indigo) + `nocturne` (all-cool night slate) + `ember` (Rothko Four Darks in Red, maroon-black).** Round-2 cut `autumn`/`convergence`: "both too similar to one another and to fathom" — on a pale ground with a black structural ink the GROUND dominates the gestalt, so multiple light palettes collapse into one impression; a future light-ground candidate must differ at the ground level, not the inks. Process lesson recorded in memory `feedback-palette-curation-process`.

> **AMENDED 2026-06-10 (FBS.S3.1, same day) — two defects from Matt's live read (session `2026-06-10T17-21-49Z`):**
> 1. **The rest-window swap condition was structurally broken.** Bridge and live phase derive from the SAME tempo, so their relative offset is frozen — the narrow phase-window coincidence either fires every cycle or NEVER. Money: **zero eligible frames in 63 s**; the track stayed on the bridge for its entire playback (Matt: "It never moved over… only the pulse was present"). Love Rehab et al. simply drew lucky offsets. Replaced with an **envelope-floor condition** (both envelopes < 0.15): the bridge's low-envelope span covers > 1 full live cycle of time, so a joint-low frame exists in EVERY bridge cycle — guaranteed, with the seam step bounded by the floor. Regression-locked by `test_handoff_firesOnMoney_theStructuralCounterexample` (replays Money's recorded series; red under the old condition).
> 2. **The per-beat punch attack read as FLASHING.** The 0.08-of-cycle attack spans ~37 ms at song tempo = 1–2 frames — a near-single-frame spike-height + reflected-light step. Measured: 8–10 envelope steps > 0.65/min on every handed-off track — and ZERO on Money, the one track with no flashing complaint (the bridge's 4-beat attack is gentle). Attack lengthened to 0.20 of the cycle (~100 ms at 120 BPM) — still a punch, never a frame-strobe. `BeatPulseClock.envelope` is now the cross-annotated CPU authority for the shader envelope shape.
> The track-start aurora warmup (BUG-041/S2.2) remains in place; this session's session-wide flashing is attributed to the punch attack on the Money-control evidence — Matt's next look adjudicates.

## D-157 — FBS: the beat punch gets a spatial footprint — each beat, smoothly-bounded REGIONS of the spike field punch (~⅓, re-drawn per beat); the global frame luminance stays steady

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** FBS.S4 · **Status:** Ratified (Matt chose option B: "B is good")

**Context.** The first full-session video (BUG-039 recovery) enabled a pixel-level census: 373 flash events across every track at ~beat cadence. The forensics ablation matrix was conclusive — full replica 69 flash steps on the So What window; **pulse OFF → 0**; aurora OFF / light frozen → unchanged. The flashing IS the global beat punch: the whole spike field leaping each beat swung the entire frame's mean luminance 6–84 (0–255) — geometry-as-rhythm reading as luminance-as-strobe, while the same mechanism was the beat-sync Matt praised on Money.

**Decision.** `fo_spike_strength` gains a position argument and multiplies the punch envelope by a **smooth per-beat regional mask**: value noise over xz (patch scale ~2.5 wu, smoothstep band 0.55–0.80 ≈ ⅓ of the field active), domain-shifted by `pulse_beat_index` (new FV float 42, reclaimed `_pad6`; counted by `BeatPulseClock` — metronome cycles on the bridge, live wraps after handoff, reset per track). Baseline posture and the swell are untouched; the punch cap drops 1.62 → 1.55 to keep the mask's added height-field gradient inside the CSP.3.5 Lipschitz /6 budget.

**Acceptance (the same instrument that convicted the punch).** Re-render of the convicting So What window: whole-frame flash steps **69 → 1** (total magnitude 734 → 6.4); localized punch motion **preserved and strong** (top block deltas ≈ 65 with the punch vs ≈ 22 ambient); no white-pixel bursts (Lipschitz margin held); live-path paired A/B: global punch |δ| 28 → 8.7 luma with rest-window exactly 0 (still beat-locked). All FBS suites + goldens green.

**References.** D-153/D-154/D-156 (the pulse), BUG-039 (the video evidence chain), the 2026-06-10 forensics commits, Matt's option-B pick.

## D-158 — FBS.S5: the remaining flasher was the vocals-pitch → aurora-HUE route (proven by ablation); aurora transitions slow to Matt's 8–10 s (hue CPU-side τ≈3 s EMA + intensity τ 2.7/3.3 s), and the bridge heave goes back to GLOBAL with regional punches only after the handoff

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** FBS.S5 · **Status:** Implemented per Matt's three S4 directives (session `2026-06-10T19-13-14Z` read); awaiting his live read

**Context.** After D-157, flashing was "still present, prominent on some tracks" (census ~150 → 79 clustered events). The decisive S4 finding: on the So What te 31–41 window the VIDEO showed 72–84-luma flashes but the forensics replica reproduced almost nothing — the flasher lived in an un-replicated route. The replica's known gap was vocals pitch → aurora hue (`vocalsPitchHz`/`vocalsPitchConfidence` never set in the harness), and Matt independently perceived "aurora color shifting too quickly."

**The proof (S5 forensics, before any fix).** Replicating the two pitch fields from `stems.csv` took the replica from 1 → **13** whole-frame flash steps on So What 31–41 and 0 → **15** on Lotus 45–51; a new `aurora-hue` ablation arm (zeroing ONLY those two fields) restored 1 / 0. Mechanism, visible in the recorded data: pitch confidence crosses the hue gate boundary (smoothstep 0.5→0.7) **~9×/s** on real music (90 crossings in the 10 s So What window), snapping `palettePhase` between the pitch phase and the valence fallback (up to 0.4 of palette phase = across palette stops); at curtain intensity 2.5–5.5 reflected across the whole mirror substrate, each snap stepped the entire frame's luminance.

**Decisions (Matt's directives, implemented).**
1. **Aurora hue moves CPU-side behind a τ ≈ 3 s EMA** (`RenderPipeline.auroraHueStep`, pure fn; same composite pitch/valence math the shader ran per-pixel, now smoothed and shipped as `StemFeatures.auroraPalettePhase`, float 45, reclaimed `_sfPad3`, renderer-transient). A hue transition completes in ~9 s; gate flapping averages to a stable intermediate hue. The fix kills the proven flasher BY DESIGN of the requested character change.
2. **Aurora intensity transitions slow to the same window**: `auroraDriverStep` rise τ 0.45 → 2.7 s, fall 1.2 → 3.3 s (~8 s up / ~10 s down at 3τ). Soft-knee + BUG-041 warmup unchanged. The brightness becomes a slow swell following the track's drum-energy arc, not individual hits.
3. **The bridge heave is GLOBAL again; regional punches only after the handoff** ("the slow opening heave was not visible with regional coverage" + "keep the regional punches"). `BeatPulseClock` ships `regionalBlend01` — 0 on the bridge, ramping 0 → 1 over one 4-beat span after the handoff (no coverage cliff) — via FV float 43 (reclaimed `_pad7`); `fo_spike_strength` mixes `mix(1.0, mask, blend)`. The global per-beat strobe cannot return: blend is 1 by the time per-beat punches drive the envelope (the strobe was a post-handoff phenomenon; bridge-only Money drew no flash complaint in S3).

**Not slowed (explicitly).** The orbit-drift hue rotation (round-61's 2.5 s base revolution on `accumulated_audio_time` ≈ 25–37 s wall-clock per full cycle, ~8–12 s between palette stops) already sits in the directed regime and was Matt-tuned across rounds 55→61; it is untouched.

**Acceptance (the convicting instrument, post-fix).** Four windows of session `2026-06-10T19-13-14Z` re-rendered with full pitch replication: So What 31–41 **13 → 1** flash steps, Lotus 45–51 **15 → 0**, Love Rehab 28–38 **1**, There There 2–10 **0** — with localized punch deltas preserved (top blocks ~45–63). Live-path A/B: the global bridge punch moves the spike field |δ| = 25.3 luma at the heave, 0.0 at rest. New gates: `AuroraHueDriverTests` (flap immunity ≤ 0.005/frame, 8–10 s step response pinned, converged targets match the shader formula), `test_regionalBlend_zeroOnBridge_rampsToOneAfterHandoff` (real Love Rehab session replay). `features.csv` gains trailing `pulse_beat_index`/`pulse_regional_blend01` so future replicas are exact.

**References.** D-153/D-154/D-156/D-157 (the pulse chain), BUG-041 (aurora intensity hardening — stands, was not the flasher), FBS.S5 forensics commits, `docs/prompts/FBS_S5_CONTINUITY.md`.

> **AMENDED 2026-06-10 (FBS.S5b — Matt's pick from the `2026-06-10T20-26-37Z` read).** The live read: flashing "mostly gone" (census 79 → 13 events / 154 s) but the global heave's opening window read as unsynced ("the feeling of sync is mostly lost during this 10s interval"). Census + ablation on the new session attributed the residual cold-start events to **the global bridge heave itself** (pulse OFF → 0; aurora/hue/light → unchanged) — the same whole-frame mechanism D-157 cured mid-track, re-admitted in openings by directive 3; the mid-track paired one-frame blips (3 in 154 s) do not reproduce in the replica (suspected video-encode, not render). Matt chose **C + A** from the presented options:
> - **(C) Intensity τ reverted to 0.45/1.2 s** — the brightness shimmer returns (it was measured flash-safe by the S3.2 gates + S4 ablation and was never the flasher); the HUE stays slow (τ 3 s, the actual fix). Decision §2 above is superseded for intensity; §1 (hue) stands.
> - **(A) Early handoff** (amends D-156's fixed 10 s window): when `LiveBeatDriftTracker` reports LOCKED, the handoff window opens at **4 s** (`BeatPulseClock.handoffEarliestS`; envelope-floor seam condition unchanged); the 10 s window remains the unlocked fallback. Measured on the read session: first lock at te 7.0–8.5 s on all five tracks → expect ~2–3 s earlier handoffs, shrinking both the unsynced window and the heave's flash exposure.
> Gates: `test_earlyHandoff_firesSoonAfter4s_whenTrackerLocked` (real-session replay, locked → handoff in [4, 7) s, seam-safe); forensics windows on the read session unchanged post-revert (cold start 2 steps — the heave, by design until handoff; mid-track 1/1). Full suite 1429 green, app build OK, lint 0.

## D-159 — Skein.6 certification: lightweight rubric, FNV-1a seed ratified, coverage bound amended to never-solid/never-near-empty, canvas soak replaces the audio-path harness for §5.5

**Date:** 2026-06-10 · **Increment:** Skein.6 · **Status:** ✅ **CERTIFIED 2026-06-11** — Matt M7 PASS ("It looks great. Ready to certify", session `2026-06-11T01-56-22Z`). The pre-flip session review surfaced **BUG-046** (the structure sub-feature riding BUG-042's note-scale junk at conf 0.78–0.95 on streaming material — the "structure inert on junk" cert premise held only on local-file material); Matt's pick (a 10 wall-s boundary-spacing guard in `SkeinState`) landed before the flip. First `painterly`-family certified preset.

**Context.** Skein's look was Matt-approved at the 5.4 eyeball gate (three live sessions, 2026-06-10, post-round-2 tune). Skein.6 is gates + docs + the D-142(c) deferred engine touch — no behavioural change. Four certification decisions fell out of making the §5.5/§5.7 contracts executable:

1. **Rubric profile = `lightweight`** (the README rubric-tension flag's expected outcome; Dragon Bloom / D-064 precedent — §12.2/§12.3 assume surface-shaded 3D geometry a 2D painterly feedback preset doesn't have). The automated lightweight gate reads `false` on L2 *by construction*: Skein's deviation primitives (`stems.*EnergyDev`, `midAttRel`, D-026) are consumed CPU-side in `SkeinState` and reach the shader pre-computed via the slot-6 buffer, invisible to the MSL-source heuristic (the Lumen Mosaic slot-8 precedent). Locked in `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate`; Matt's M7 is the load-bearing gate per SHADER_CRAFT §12.1.

2. **Seed source ratified as FNV-1a `title|artist`** (`lumenTrackSeedHash` → `currentSkeinSeed()`), NOT the track SHA-256 the §5.7/§1 design wording proposed. The FNV-1a seed produced every painting Matt approved (Skein.3 → 5.4); rewiring to SHA-256 would silently change every track's painting for zero determinism gain. Design doc + README wording amended; the determinism property itself is unchanged (same track → same seed → same painting).

3. **Coverage bound amended — Matt's decision (2026-06-10, presented with measurements): the approved density stands; §5.7's "typical track ends 60–80 %" is retired** as a pre-implementation estimate. Measured on the approved sessions through the live dispatch path at 900×600: 39 % @ 9 s, 74 % @ 29 s, 80.2 % @ 43 s (longest approved single track), plateau ≈ 87 % @ 100 s — a full track ends ~85–90 %, ground always breathing through (~10–15 %), late paint layering over earlier paint. Live-video cross-check at 29 s confirms harness/live parity. **Coverage fraction is RESOLUTION-DEPENDENT** — the droplet AA radius floor (`max(drr, px·1.5)`) widens sub-pixel satellites at small render targets: the same run reads 94.7 % at 200×200 vs 80.2 % at 900×600. The automated gate (`test_cert_coverageBound`) therefore renders at 600×400 with thresholds calibrated there: < 95 % (never solid; measured 89.6 % on the densest input — tiled multi-track real stems, no wipes) and > 40 % (never near-empty). Any future Skein coverage measurement must state its render size.

4. **The §5.5 soak runs the CANVAS, not the audio path.** `SoakTestHarness` is the headless audio-path harness (memory + frame timing, no render) — it cannot observe canvas banding/drift. The §5.5 gate is `test_cert_soak_twoHourCanvasHold` (`SKEIN_SOAK=1`, ~10 min wall): 432,000 frames = 120 simulated minutes through the live mv_warp dispatch path — 15 min real stems (thin-paint layering), 90 min silence (whole-canvas RGBA byte-identity = the lossless-hold claim at hours scale; wetness alpha holds at silence), 15 min real stems (painting resumes, never-white, ground corner intact). 16-bit canvas fallback only if this gate fails (stop-and-report, not a silent format swap — D-137 GPU-stall-trap territory).

Plus the D-142(c) deferred engine touch: **`PresetCategory.painterly`** + `Skein.json` `family: "painterly"` (audited blast radius: enum case + displayName + count test + sidecar; UI iterates `allCases`, no exhaustive switches elsewhere; orchestrator family logic nil-safe → Skein simply starts participating in family boosts/cooldowns once certified).

**Gates landed.** `test_cert_coverageBound` (180 s live-path run, real tiled stems, 600×400); §5.7 determinism formalised as dHash ≤ 8 across two same-seed live-path runs in `test_seedDeterminismAndReseed` (byte-identity stays the stronger assert; full-track evidence 2×10,800 frames pixel-diff 0 / hamming 0); golden dHash entry in `PresetRegressionTests` (three fixtures identical — static ground, the Nimbus pattern); the §5.5 soak above.

## D-160 — FBS Stage 2: the beat-punch HEIGHT follows passage loudness (smoothed total stem energy → height scale [0.30, 1.0]); the beat keeps the timing, energy sets only the size

**Date:** 2026-06-11 · **Increment:** FBS.S6 (Stage 2 of the FBS kickoff) · **Status:** Implemented per the Matt-approved kickoff §Stage 2 + his "Sure proceed" (2026-06-11); awaiting his live read

**Context.** The kickoff's Stage 2 contract: per-punch height from live energy — loud → tall, soft → small, a small floor so every beat registers while music plays, nothing at silence (the existing amp gate). Matt's observed motivator: So What's bass+piano intro got the same full-strength punches as the band sections ("too energetic until piano/bass" — S3.1 read).

**Signal selection (measured, not assumed).** On sessions `2026-06-11T01-56-22Z` / `2026-06-10T20-26-37Z`: the AGC'd FeatureVector band sum is FLAT (~0.25) across So What's entire dynamic arc — useless, exactly as FA #31 predicts. The **total stem energy** (drums+bass+vocals+other — the same sum the FFO sky's live gate reads) separates 4×: intro 0.33–0.35 vs band 0.8–1.5; Love Rehab / Pyramid open ≥ 1.1 (no false quiet on strong openings); Lotus ramps 0.64 → 1.3.

**Mechanism.** CPU driver `RenderPipeline.punchEnergyStep` — **symmetric τ 2.5 s EMA** (an asymmetric fast-rise variant was built first and MEASURED WRONG: So What's intro stem sum is bursty — median 0.22, p90 1.28 — and a 0.8 s rise peak-followed the bursts, putting the "quiet" intro at height 0.67 and collapsing the contrast to 1.5×; symmetric 2.5 s tracks the passage mean: intro 0.40 / band 0.99, contrast 2.5×). Ships as `StemFeatures.totalEnergySmoothed` (float 46, reclaimed `_sfPad4`, renderer-transient). Shader mapping in `fo_spike_strength`: `height = mix(0.30, 1.0, smoothstep(0.25, 1.0, total_energy_smoothed))` multiplying the punch term — scale ≤ 1 only reduces, the 1.55 Lipschitz cap holds. Applies to the bridge heave too (quiet openings heave gently). Per-hit drama remains the aurora drums driver's job (0.45 s rise) — no timescale is doubled (FA #67 audit: punch layer = beat phase + passage-loudness size; swell = arousal; aurora = drums-dev sub-second + slow hue).

**Acceptance.** Pure-fn gates (`PunchEnergyDriverTests`): glide-never-step, 3τ transitions, and the real So What fixture replay (intro height 0.40 < 0.5, band 0.97 > 0.85, contrast 2.4×). Live-path pixel gate (`FerrofluidPulseLivePathTests`): same punch frame at intro-level vs loud envelope → punch effect 20.6 vs 48.7 luma (2.4×), floor keeps quiet beats registering. Forensics A/B on the quiet-intro window (new `punch-height` arm pins pre-Stage-2 full height): So What 0–8 s flash steps 3 → 1 (magnitude 27 → 14) — Stage 2 also shrinks the residual cold-start heave flashing. Full suite 1430 green, app build OK, lint 0.

**Open dial (Matt's, at his read):** the floor (how small the quietest punch is — currently 30 % height) and the loud threshold are product constants; both are single numbers in the shader mapping.

## D-161: Rulebook restructure + always-loaded token-budget ratchet (RB.1 → RB.3)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-11)

The RB series replaced the failure → prose-rule → bigger-rulebook loop with a slim always-loaded core plus mechanized gates and read-on-demand references. Matt's per-entry review (context: `docs/diagnostics/RB1_FA_DN_EXPLANATIONS.md`; audit inventory: `docs/diagnostics/RB1_RULEBOOK_AUDIT.md`) cut CLAUDE.md from ~22,300 to ~6,900 estimated tokens: Failed Approaches 49 → 6 (FA #4 absorbed into §Audio Data Hierarchy in constraint-based form), Do-NOT bullets 57 → 1, ten pointer sections merged into §Handbook Index, preset-session discipline → `PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`, U.11 build/test notes → RUNBOOK §Engineering notes; DECISIONS.md 161 → 68 active entries (93 archived to `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md`); ENGINEERING_PLAN completed narratives pre-2026-06-01 → `ENGINEERING_PLAN_HISTORY.md` (headers stay as the status record).

**Standing ratchet rules** (installed in CLAUDE.md §Increment Completion Protocol; budget gated by `DocIntegrityTests`):

1. **Token budget:** CLAUDE.md ≤ 7,000 estimated tokens (`wc -w` × 1.35), one-in-one-out — adding above the cap requires demoting or retiring equal mass in the same commit.
2. **Admission test:** a new always-loaded rule must name the specific mistake it prevents and why no deterministic gate can express it; otherwise it goes to a handbook, a session checklist, or a gate.
3. **Violated twice → mechanize:** the second documented violation of a prose rule converts it — the fix increment ships the gate and demotes the prose to a pointer.

**Reason:** instruction-following degrades as the simultaneously-active rule count grows, and the transcript record shows prose rules failing while loaded (REVIEW.1: README-before-edit at 35 % compliance; BUG-036's three realtime-allocation sites written with the no-alloc bullet in context; the FA #66 fixture/live class recurring with the rule present). Gates and feedback loops beat prose; judgment rules earn always-loaded slots only when they must fire at decision time, before any artifact exists that a gate could check.

## D-162: Doc rotation is mechanized; budgets are gated

**Status:** Accepted (DOC.6, 2026-06-12)

The pruning-pass prose convention failed twice (measured 2026-06-12: EP narratives four weeks past the RB.3 window; KNOWN_ISSUES 71% resolved-history; release notes unrotated at 696 KB). Per D-161 rule 3, it converts to mechanism: `Scripts/rotate_docs.sh` performs the EP §Recently Completed, KNOWN_ISSUES §Resolved, and release-notes monthly rotations deterministically; DocIntegrityTests gates the budgets (EP narrative age ≤ 14 days, KNOWN_ISSUES §Resolved ≤ 50 KB, pre-current-month release-notes content ≤ 50 KB — the active file keeps the current month, which alone measured 72 KB at filing, so the byte budget gates rotation debt rather than whole-file size) and index completeness (DECISIONS §Index, KNOWN_ISSUES §Open Index). Closeout evidence runs the gates. Rotated content moves verbatim to history files and stays searchable; nothing is deleted. The judgment-requiring pruning items (CLAUDE.md section demotion, DECISIONS shipped+uncited rotation) remain manual on the same cadence.

## D-163: Audit keep-list + executableTarget STATUS markers guard dead-code audits

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-14)

A repo-wide over-engineering audit (2026-06-14) flagged three *certified, planner-pickable* presets (Murmuration, Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana) and a *deliberately-retained* diagnostic tool (ColdStartVerifier — kept per "keep the tools" at the 2026-05-25 cold-start revert) as dead code. The root cause was a documentation/memory gap, not a code problem: nothing distinguished *active* / *retained-diagnostic* / *actually-dead*, so status was inferable only by guessing — and the "zero production importers" heuristic is structurally wrong for the two classes it hit (CLI tools have no importers by design; a quiet certified preset has no recent commits yet is live). **Decision:** every `executableTarget` carries a `// STATUS: active-tool | retained-diagnostic` marker near the top of its entry file (self-describing files), and `docs/AUDIT_KEEPLIST.md` is the read-first register before any deletion — listing the certified presets, the eight tool CLIs, and the gated dev instrumentation that look dead but are kept, plus an honest "genuinely dead" list whose removal is a separate decision. Per the D-161 admission test this is a judgment rule that must fire at audit time, before any artifact a gate could check exists; rather than spend an always-loaded CLAUDE.md slot (the file sits at ~98.7 % of its token cap), it lives at the source + a read-on-demand doc + memory, adding zero CLAUDE.md mass. A second recurrence would, per D-161 rule 3, justify mechanizing (e.g. a gate that fails when a doc claims a file was deleted that is still on disk, or that shields `certified: true` presets from delete-lists) — premature on first occurrence. Filed alongside a doc-drift correction: `ENGINEERING_PLAN_HISTORY.md` claimed `Scripts/convert_beatnet_weights.py` was already removed when it was still on disk; the D-163 follow-up then actually deleted it (with the dead CoreML stem converter/test pair) and historicized the BeatNet `CREDITS.md` attribution.

## D-164: Photosensitivity flash-safety is an enforced, certifiable invariant — measurement gate now, runtime clamp next

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-16)

The only open *safety* gap (audit **G9**, P1; the strict-photosensitivity mode **D-054/U.9** deferred). Flash-safety was per-preset/manual convention only (`SHADER_CRAFT` "never edge-trigger on `drums_beat`" + the FFO anti-references) with **no enforced output-side clamp**; distribution (CLEAN.2.5a hardened runtime + notarization path) made it real. **Standard:** Harding / WCAG 2.3.1 general flash — a *flash* is a pair of opposing relative-luminance changes ≥ 10 % where the darker state is < 0.80; unsafe is **> 3 flashes/s** over a large area.

**Decision (Matt, 2026-06-16, two AskUserQuestion picks):** enforce by **measurement now (certification gate), runtime clamp as a deliberate A-next follow-up** — i.e. the hybrid, staged over two increments, *not* a look-altering runtime clamp bundled now (which would force a golden regen + M7 re-review of every certified preset and risk softening the hand-tuned FBS beat-luminance motion of D-157/D-158). The gate is non-destructive, reuses the measurement idea from the FBS flash census, and *proves* the shipping presets safe or finds the ones that aren't.

**What shipped (CLEAN.7.6):** `FlashAnalyzer` (pure Harding/WCAG analyzer on a full-frame relative-luminance sequence; 8 synthetic self-checks pin the semantics) + `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests` (renders each certified preset over a synthetic worst-case 4.5 Hz beat train, measures rendered full-frame luminance, fails cert at > 3 flashes/s).

**Forced-partial finding (the reason this is staged, not complete).** Three premises in the kickoff were false against the repo and were surfaced to Matt before building: (1) the FBS "373-events" A/B *video* was never committed (only 3-band feature CSVs survive) → the analyzer's correctness proof is the synthetic self-check, not a recorded A/B; (2) the `Fixtures/fbs` CSVs are 3-band energy extracts carrying none of the beat/deviation/stem signals that cause flashing, and are not `SessionDataLoader`-compatible; (3) `PresetSessionReplay` is an `executableTarget` the test suite cannot import. The deeper finding came from running the gate: the lightweight single-pass harness drives **only the `FeatureVector`**, so it validly measures only presets that read their music response from it in the fragment pass — **Ferrofluid Ocean and Murmuration (both measured SAFE, 0 flashes/s).** The other five certified presets render **static** here because their music response arrives via paths the harness does not run — CPU follower-state buffers (Lumen Mosaic, Nimbus), the rayMarch multi-pass G-buffer chain (Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana), or feedback-texture history (Skein). A static render is **never asserted "safe"** (a vacuous pass is the cardinal sin for a safety gate, CLEAN.0); those five are tracked in `unmeasurableInHarness` and the gate **fails loud on drift** (a known-static preset that starts responding, a responsive one that regresses to static, or a new certified preset that renders static). Matt's call (third AskUserQuestion): **ship the partial gate now, fold the rest into A-next** — valid flash-safety for the static set requires the **A-next headless real-`RenderPipeline` harness** (followers ticked + feedback + multi-pass), which is also where the runtime clamp lands. Further documented blind spots (all A-next): full-frame mean only (no regional/area-gating), no saturated-red-flash channel, normal certified regime only.

**Runtime clamp (A-next) — superseded by [D-166] (2026-06-17): evaluated under CLEAN.7.6d and *not pursued* (the certification gate is the enforcement mechanism).** As scoped, it would have been a final full-screen luminance slew-limiter at `RenderPipeline.draw(in:)` *before* the `onFrameRendered` recorder hook, transparent below the danger band; gated behind the OR-flag pattern reserved at `RayMarchPipeline:94` (never assign `reducedMotion` directly). It will move goldens and **requires an M7 re-review of every certified preset** — its own M7 sitting, not a bundle.

**References.** Audit G9 (`CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-13.md:181` + Part C CLEAN.7.6), D-054/U.9 (the deferred strict mode this resolves), D-157/D-158 (the FBS regional-punch / hue-route fixes that made the certified beat-luminance safe — the metric must pass that motion, not flatten it), FA #73 (reuse the forensics machinery, don't rebuild), the kickoff `docs/prompts/CLEAN_7.6_PHOTOSENSITIVITY_KICKOFF.md`.

## D-165: Silent-tap family — detect, don't churn; only rebuild a never-delivered tap

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-17)

The streaming process tap can deliver persistent silence (a wedged `coreaudiod`; a stale Screen-Recording grant after a re-signed rebuild — BUG-055) or freeze (a device swap stalls the IO-proc — BUG-058). Instrumented live sessions (2026-06-17) corrected two earlier beliefs: the silence is often **environmental, not a Uzume bug** — but the `.silent → reinstall` recovery was itself **harmful**. It fired on *any* sustained silence, including a user pause, churning the tap; intermittently a recreate came up created-but-dead and never recovered (the visualizer froze with live audio playing). Three decisions:

1. **The reinstall machine only rebuilds a tap that NEVER delivered audio this session** (`SilenceDetector.hasEverDetectedSignal`, RMS-thresholded, reset per `start(mode:)`). A session that *has* had audio and then goes silent is a pause — the working tap is left alone and resumes on its own when audio returns. This keeps recovery for a genuinely broken cold install (BUG-055 / wedged daemon) while removing the pause-churn + dead-tap lottery. Validated 2026-06-17: 3/3 clean pause/resume recoveries on the same tap generation, zero churn. (Supersedes the prior ARCHITECTURE "reinstall on any prolonged silence" behaviour.) The **device-change** reinstall (`SystemAudioCapture.performReinstall`, CLEAN.1.5) is a separate path and is NOT gated — a real default-output change genuinely needs a new tap.

2. **A user-facing detector surfaces "no useful audio is reaching the visualizer" instead of a silent flatline.** `PlaybackErrorBridge` runs a ~1 Hz freshness poll and raises a prominent non-blocking `AudioStallOverlayView` card (a fix ladder) after ~10 s of no fresh audio while playing — catching **both** failure modes: RMS≈0 (`.silent`) AND a frozen IO-proc (tap frame count stops advancing). It is **suppressed on a likely pause** (the same `hasEverDetectedSignal` signal: callbacks advancing + `.silent` + session has had audio) so it only fires on a genuine break, and auto-clears on recovery. Implemented as a **bespoke Bool-driven overlay, not a new `UserFacingError` case** — an enum case plus a presentation mode nothing dispatches on would be ceremony and would churn the 29-case coverage test; the copy is externalized directly.

3. **Doctrine (`feedback_self_healing_over_manual_remediation`): the manual fix-ladder card is a fallback, not the fix.** The end-state must not make a user run Terminal commands or toggle System Settings panes — the user-friendly answer is the app **self-healing** (decision 1) plus stable signing (CLEAN.2.5b). The card is the developer / safety-net surface until then; soften its copy before any public build.

FA #73 (reuse `PlaybackErrorBridge` + the existing reinstall machinery — no parallel detector, no new reinstall path).

## D-166: Photosensitivity runtime clamp not pursued — the certification gate is the enforcement mechanism (amends D-164)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-17)

Closes the "runtime clamp (A-next)" half of [D-164] with a decision **not to build it**. CLEAN.7.6d opened to implement the clamp; two facts surfaced once the work started, and Matt chose (two AskUserQuestion picks) to stop at the cert gate.

**Trip-point pick.** Where a clamp *would* engage was set at the **medical limit, 3 flashes/s** (WCAG 2.3.1) — the option transparent to every current preset, acting only on genuinely seizure-risk content. This sets the bar for any future reopening; it is not itself built.

**Why the clamp is not built.**
1. **The cert gate already enforces the 3/s line on everything we ship.** CLEAN.7.6 / 7.6b / 7.6c brought `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests` to **7/7 ENFORCED** — every certified preset is proven ≤ 3/s under a 4.5 Hz beat + stem drive sharper than real music. Uzume ships *only* certified presets, so shipped content is covered without a runtime clamp. Stage-1 peak-flashes/s, all 7: FFO / Murmuration / Nimbus / Lumen Mosaic / Skein **0.00**, Fata Morgana **0.50**, Dragon Bloom **1.00** — none within a third of the limit.
2. **A uniform clamp is a pipeline-wide change disproportionate to its residual value.** D-164 assumed the clamp could be "a final full-screen pass at `draw(in:)`." The real pipeline has **no single chokepoint**: `renderFrame` (`RenderPipeline+Draw.swift:126`) fans out to **8 terminal paths** (meshShader, rayMarch, postProcess, icb, feedback, mvWarp, staged, drawDirect), each acquiring and presenting *its own* drawable. A uniform clamp means rerouting all 8 through a shared final-target → clamp → present tail — touching every certified preset with regression risk, plus an always-paid per-frame luminance readback + extra pass — for a net that never visibly engages on any shipped content. Its only residual value is content the cert gate cannot see (unfinished pre-cert presets; a theoretical live track past the synthetic worst case). Matt judged the cert gate sufficient and the invasive change unjustified.

**Go-forward.** The **certification gate is the photosensitivity enforcement mechanism** — not a runtime clamp. New certified presets must pass `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests`; its multi-pass set fails loud if a new preset renders static without joining the harness (D-164). The `RayMarchPipeline:94` OR-flag slot stays **reserved**. Reopen only on a new premise — shipping un-certified / user-authored presets, or live arbitrary-source rendering — and reopen *with the 8-path reroute cost in hand* (this entry), do not re-derive it. A non-altering **live monitor** (detect-but-don't-correct) was offered and also declined for now.

**References.** Amends [D-164] (the "runtime clamp A-next" line this closes). Audit G9 (`CODE_AUDIT_2026-06-13.md` §G9 / CLEAN.7.6d), `RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY §9`, the runtime kickoff `docs/prompts/CLEAN_7.6b_PHOTOSENSITIVITY_RUNTIME_KICKOFF.md` (superseded for the clamp half). D-054/U.9 (the original strict-mode deferral), D-157/D-158 (the certified beat-luminance motion the cert gate must pass, not flatten).

## D-167: Thermal + Low Power Mode feed a quality floor into the frame-budget governor (CLEAN.4.6)

> **AMENDED 2026-08-26 (RECON.19) — Low Power Mode floors at `.noBloom`. Matt's call.** The original decision floored it at `.noSSGI`, which reduced **nothing** in practice: no preset ever declared the SSGI pass, so Low Power Mode imposed no actual reduction for its whole life. RECON.18 deleted SSGI and that rung, and deliberately left the floor absent rather than promote it silently — a new user-visible reduction is a product call, not a cleanup side effect. Asked, Matt chose `.noBloom`.
>
> **Consequence — this is genuinely new behaviour, not a restoration.** Low Power Mode now drops bloom for the first time. ACES tone-mapping still runs (the post-process pass is not skipped), so the result is flatter highlights, not a flat image. Certified presets are unaffected at full quality; certification grades a preset's own fidelity, and the governor is orthogonal to it. The thermal floors (serious → no-bloom, critical → step-0.75) are unchanged, and Low Power Mode never weakens a stronger thermal floor.

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-18)

Wires `ProcessInfo` thermal state + Low Power Mode into the [D-057] frame-budget governor so visual load drops *ahead* of the GPU's own thermal throttle, and the user's Low Power Mode choice is respected. Closes audit **G4** (GAP-4) — previously zero `thermalState`/`lowPowerMode` references anywhere.

**Mechanism.** `FrameBudgetManager` gains a `thermalFloor: QualityLevel`; the applied level is `max(currentLevel, thermalFloor)` — independent of the timing hysteresis. A rising thermal state therefore pre-empts the downshift (no waiting for the 3 timing-overrun detection), and clearing it restores quality *immediately* (the timing `currentLevel` was never raised, so no 180-frame recovery wait). The governor stays `ProcessInfo`-free and pure: the listener reads `ProcessInfo` and calls `setThermalFloor`. `VisualizerEngine` observes `thermalStateDidChangeNotification` + `NSProcessInfoPowerStateDidChange`, maps via the pure static `FrameBudgetManager.qualityFloor(thermalState:lowPowerMode:)`, and seeds the floor at FBM creation (in case the app launches already hot / in LPM). The new floor takes effect on the next `observe(_:)` — under render load, the next frame (~16 ms, far ahead of the seconds-scale thermal build-up).

**Mapping (tunable policy).** thermal `.nominal`/`.fair` → `.full` (no floor); `.serious` → `.noBloom` (drop SSGI + bloom); `.critical` → `.reducedRayMarch` (+ 0.75× ray-march steps). Low Power Mode imposes at least `.noSSGI` and never weakens a stronger thermal floor (`max`). Chosen for "meaningful GPU/power relief without gutting the look"; only visible under thermal stress, and tunable in one function.

**Scope.** The `QualityCeiling.ultra` recording exemption (D-057(d), `enabled == false`) still bypasses the floor — recording deliberately wants full quality; overriding that under thermal stress is a separate decision (reopen if fanless recording-under-thermal becomes real). The mechanism is unit-tested (the floor clamps the applied level without touching the timing state; timing can still downshift below the floor; the floor survives `reset()`; the mapping is correct). The actual thermal-induced pre-emption needs **device validation under load** — the Mac mini's active cooling rarely throttles, so this matters mainly for fanless deployment.

## D-168: ARCHITECTURE Module Map completeness is a gated invariant (CLEAN.7.3)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-18)

The Module Map (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) is the per-file behavioural reference read before grep-ing the codebase. Its "every file" claim was unenforced and drifted: the 2026-06-13 audit (T14) found 18 undocumented files; by 2026-06-18 it was **62** — including four entire CERTIFIED presets (Skein, Murmuration, Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana) and recent infra (FlashAnalyzer, DefaultOutputDeviceMonitor, ConcurrencyAuditProbe, the streaming-artwork cluster). An incomplete "read this before grep-ing" index is worse than none — it reads as authoritative while silently omitting whole subsystems.

**Decision (Matt, via the CLEAN.7.3 scoping question).** Backfill all 62 entries AND mechanize completeness with a gate — rather than a one-time backfill (band-aid; would re-drift) or folding it into CLEAN.7.5. This is the [D-161] ratchet rule 3 ("violated twice → mechanize") applied: the prose contract failed at least twice, so it converts to a test.

**Mechanism.** `DocIntegrityTests.moduleMapCompleteness` walks every `.swift` / `.metal` under `UzumeEngine/Sources` + `UzumeApp/` and reds if a file's name-minus-extension is not a substring of the `## Module Map` section. Diagnostic/tooling modules and utility trees are documented as ONE group entry that NAMES its files (the established V.1-noise-tree convention), so a group entry satisfies the gate for all its files. **Accepted ceiling:** substring membership, not entry-line parsing — a short common stem (`main`, `Audio`) can match spuriously, so the gate is permissive (it never false-reds an unrelated increment — the BUG-049 lesson) and targets the real failure mode: a whole file/subsystem added with no mention. Tighten only if spurious passes ever bite.

**Ongoing obligation.** Every new source file under those two roots now needs a one-line Module-Map entry (or a mention in its module's group entry) or the suite reds — folded into the closeout doc-update step the Increment Completion Protocol already requires.

## D-169: Defer public-release-readiness work (extended a11y settings, cold-install resilience) until there is a public build

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-18)

CLEAN.7.7 (live Reduce-Transparency + Increase-Contrast) and CLEAN.7.8 (cold-install / resource-bootstrap resilience) are **deferred — not built — until Uzume has a public build.** Both are public-release-readiness features: HIG accessibility-setting support beyond the basics (7.7), and degraded-but-honest first-run for fresh installs (7.8). Uzume has no public build and no users beyond the developer; the accessibility + robustness BASICS that serve daily single-user dev use are already in place — Reduce Motion is wired + live (`AccessibilityState`, observing `accessibilityDisplayOptionsDidChangeNotification`), VoiceOver labels exist (`AccessibilityLabels`), and the photosensitivity notice + flash-safety certification (G9) are done. Wiring Reduce-Transparency / Increase-Contrast + cold-install resilience for users who do not yet exist is YAGNI.

**Trigger to revisit:** a public-build / release-readiness pass, OR the developer personally running macOS with those accessibility settings enabled (then it degrades a real daily experience and is worth doing).

**Scope.** This defers the audit *gaps* GAP-15 (7.7) and GAP-12 (7.8). It does NOT remove or weaken any shipped accessibility behavior — Reduce Motion's current art + chrome calming stays as-is. Establishes the standing principle: **don't build public-release-readiness features for users who don't exist yet; the bar for daily single-user dev use is the existing basics.**

## D-170: Section detection via McFee/Ellis spectral clustering on a beat-synced 252-bin log-CQT

**Status:** Reversed (2026-06-24) — built (SECDET.1–.6), validated offline, live-tested 3×, then **removed**. **Re-opened and re-abandoned 2026-08-07 (SECDET.8) — see §Re-test below; do not open a third time without a supervised model.**

**Reversal (2026-06-24).** Section-aligned transitions were removed and the McFee/Ellis detector + the `~/phosphene_section_lab/` workspace deleted; the planner equal-slices for every track. Two decisive reasons: **(1) Structurally local-file-only.** Section detection needs the whole track, but streaming — Uzume's primary path — only exposes a 30 s preview before playback (no full-track file exists), so the feature could only ever serve local-file playback, and **no detector, supervised or not, changes that.** **(2) Below the perceptual bar even there.** Live-tested on real tracks it landed at F@3 ≈ 0.29–0.41 — roughly half the transitions wrong, which reads as "awful." Beat-grid-granularity tuning lifts the *offline oracle* to only ~0.58; "feels aligned" needs ~0.70+, which requires a **supervised** model. **★ Premise correction:** the "no-ML / unsupervised" rationale that steered this whole approach was a **misreading** — [D-009] is "no *CoreML*" (use MPSGraph), NOT "no ML." Uzume already ships supervised nets (Beat This!, Open-Unmix) via MPSGraph; Matt never prohibited ML. If section-aligned visuals on *local files* are ever wanted, the right path is a supervised section model ported to MPSGraph (a Beat-This!-scale effort), not more DSP. The SECDET doc history (this entry, the ENGINEERING_PLAN rows, the release notes) is kept so this isn't re-attempted from scratch on the same false premise.

**§Re-test (2026-08-07, SECDET.8).** Matt cleared reversal reason 1 — local-file-only is
now an accepted scope ("treat local files and streaming as two distinct paths") — and asked
for the detector back to drive Fractal Tree's canopy size from section boundaries. **Reason 2
survived contact and the approach was abandoned again.**

The whole port was recovered from `6a219303^` (1,338 lines, 9 files); it compiles unchanged
against today's tree and its unit tests pass (CQT peaks on the correct bin, mel basis exact
to 3.7e-9, beat-sync matches `librosa.util.sync`, LAPACK eigen correct). **The code was never
the problem.** Run on Matt's own full tracks:

| track | length | result |
|---|---|---|
| Cherub Rock | 4:58 | 14 boundaries, including repeated **8.4 s** sections (four bars — riff repetition, not structure); the solo swallowed in one 65 s block |
| Hummer | 6:57 | 5 boundaries, one **209 s** section spanning 0:54→4:23, then 3 of the 5 in the last 35 s |

Cost: **150–185 s per track** of added preparation.

Confound checked and eliminated: the run was repeated with the beat grid at half tempo
(85.65 vs the cached 171.3 BPM, since a doubled grid halves McFee's effective window). The
boundaries moved by under a second and the section count was identical — **the beat grid was
not the cause; this is the detector's real behaviour on this material.**

Consistent with the measurements that led here: on these tracks inner loudness range is
**1.4 dB**, verse and chorus share timbre, and guitar/drums energy correlates **+0.973** — the
weakest possible case for a repetition-and-contrast method.

**Correction to the reasoning that reopened it.** The argument for re-testing leaned on the
SECDET.5/.6 rows showing the live failures were confounded (a Beat This! 30 s grid truncation,
then a planner that swallowed transitions). That is true but was given more weight than it
deserved: **the offline F@3 of 0.41 was never confounded, and it was always the number that
mattered.** Matt questioned the proposal twice before the run and was closer to right both
times.

**The branch `claude/secdet-rebuild` is left UNMERGED** as the recovered scaffolding — if a
supervised section model on MPSGraph is ever built (D-170's stated path, Beat-This!-scale),
the features/graph/clustering are there. Nothing from it is on `main`.

---
*Original decision (now reversed) follows for the record:*


Uzume's section detector was novelty-only (Foote checkerboard on a chroma+spectral SSM — `StructuralAnalyzer` / `NoveltyDetector`). Novelty finds *change* points and ignores *repetition*, but a chorus is defined by repeating — so it over-fires on sub-section fills/riffs and under-fires on uniform-loud material (verse≈chorus timbre → no local contrast). This is a structural limit of the novelty *principle*, not a tuning bug (TISMIR 2020 survey), and it is why live transitions never tracked section breaks even after the LFPLAN.1–.8 plumbing was proven correct.

**Decision (Matt, 2026-06-22 directive "identify sections within songs — get this right FIRST").** Replace the offline/cached section source with **McFee & Ellis 2014 Laplacian spectral clustering** (the algorithm in `librosa.segment` / MSAF `scluster`): a k-NN recurrence graph (repetition) fused with a local sequence diagonal (contiguity) → normalized Laplacian → eigen-cluster → section labels → boundaries at label changes. Repetition-aware; fixes both novelty failure modes; produces recurrence labels (the recurring chorus gets the same label) the AI-VJ wants. Fully on-device: pure DSP + Accelerate (CQT/MFCC + LAPACK symmetric eig + hand-rolled Lloyd's k-means). **No ML / no CoreML** ([D-009] preserved) — the chosen methods are unsupervised, so no training corpus is needed; a standard annotated corpus is used only for parameter validation.

**The load-bearing feature finding.** Recurrence must be built on the **full 252-bin log-CQT in dB** (`bins_per_octave=36, n_bins=252`), NOT folded 12-chroma. 12-chroma discards register/voicing → label thrashing → over-segmentation; switching to 252-CQT lifted studio-pop F@3 from 0.36 to 0.82 on the held-out probe. CRP chroma, auto-k, Serrà SF, and CBM were all tested and dropped; **k = 5 fixed** (matches the ~6–10-section use case and beats auto-k, which over-segments studio pop).

**Validation (offline, against ground truth — never live).** Faithful McFee k=5 (252-CQT) beats Foote novelty by ~55–80% on F@3 across three datasets: SALAMI-IA (433 live tracks, F@3 0.29 vs 0.18), Isophonics-Beatles (174 studio tracks, 0.412 vs 0.230), and held-out Nirvana (0.61 vs 0.475). Lab bench + evidence: `~/phosphene_section_lab/` (`BASELINE.md`, `tune_corpus.py`, `precompute.py`). Live-session iteration was retired after it ate 4 sessions — the lab Python is the oracle; the Swift port is correct when its boundaries + F-scores reproduce the lab's on the same tracks.

**Port (SECDET epic, staged).** Stages A (features: beat-synced 252-CQT + 13 MFCC @ 22050 — SSM corr 0.9995 / MFCC corr 1.0), B (graph + LAPACK eigensolve + k-means + boundary merge — F@3 vs lab = 1.000), and C (perf — the flagged ≈2 min/track CQT was a *debug* artifact, 2.7 s in release, so no recursive-CQT port [SECDET.3a]; wire-in [SECDET.3b] — `SectionDetector` replaces `strongBoundaryTimes` in `SessionPreparer.analyzePreview`, validated end-to-end on raw PCM at F@3 = 1.000) are done. **C.4 call (folded here, no separate D-number):** the live `StructuralAnalyzer`'s *boundary* role is retired — section boundaries come from the cached batch detector (like the BeatGrid); its section-*count* role stays (`sectionIndex` → `estimatedSectionCount`, equal-slice fallback), and `boundaryTimestamps`/`boundaryNoveltyScores` remain for diagnostics, unread. The cache schema bump is done (SECDET.3c, v4 → v5). **Stage D done (SECDET.4):** the Swift detector scores **F@3 ≈ 0.41 vs hand-annotated ground truth** on real tracks (Nirvana 0.55 / Beatles 0.40 over a 20-track subset), landing at the lab's published acceptance target (0.61 / 0.41); it reproduces the lab boundaries exactly on most tracks, with a ~0.05 aggregate gap on clustering-sensitive tracks from the kernel-CQT's non-bit-identical features (the recursive CQT would close it — deferred, the bar is met). **Live test 1 → SECDET.5 (full-track beats):** the first live run exposed that **Beat This! truncates its beat grid to a fixed ~30 s window** (`BeatThisModel.tMax` = 1500 frames), so McFee — which beat-syncs on that grid — only segmented the first 30 s of a 282 s track (→ coverage gate → equal slices). Not a detector bug (SECDET.4 used full-track librosa beats); the gap was *beat coverage*, not tracker quality. Fix: `SectionDetector.fullTrackBeats` extends the grid past its last beat at the median inter-beat period so the beat-sync spans the whole track — synthetic beats beyond the tracked region suffice for the recurrence pooling. Offline A/B: 30 s-capped grid + extension scores F@3 0.48, ≥ the full-beat baseline. (Chunking Beat This! over the full track stays the heavier alternative if a tempo-varying track ever needs it.) **Offline port + the full-track-beats fix are validated; the live re-test is the remaining step.** Output contract preserved throughout: `TrackProfile.sectionStartTimes` → the planner is untouched.

## D-171: Nacre — faithful port of `$$$ Royal - Mashup (431)` onto a dedicated custom-warp+comp mv_warp branch (NACRE.2b)

**Decision.** Port the iridescent jello-mirror character of the butterchurn builtin `$$$ Royal - Mashup
(431)` as the certified preset **Nacre**, faithful base FIRST (this increment), the 3 greenlit 2026
uplifts (stem-instrument routing, real thin-film iridescence on HDR, smooth-Voronoi cells) deferred to
NACRE.3+ AFTER Matt's live M7 confirms the base reads as (431) (FA #65 — do not pre-empt/subtract from
the reference before it's proven). Sibling, NOT subclass, of Dragon Bloom ((220)) — a different register
(molten iridescent metal / oil-on-water) despite the shared author/name (D-097).

**Architecture — a dedicated draw branch, mirroring Fata Morgana (D-139), not the 2a convention path.**
The look is a custom feedback warp (reading per-frame uniforms + a wide-blur unsharp) plus a
fully-replacing comp. The shared `encodeMVWarpPass` binds `chromatic@0`/`wetness@1` and no per-frame
uniform to the warp fragment, so overloading it would risk the byte-identity guarantee for every other
mv_warp preset. Instead: `RenderPipeline+Nacre.swift` (`drawWithNacre`/`renderNacre`: warp → comp →
swap), dispatched by a one-field `isNacre` discriminator on `MVWarpPipelineBundle`/`MVWarpState`
(checked before the FM blur heuristic, since Nacre uses no blur target). `NacreUniforms` (96 B) is
computed CPU-side per frame and bound at fragment buffer(1) of both passes (the FM pattern) — so 2a's
`NacreState` (the convention-path comp buffer + `directPresetFragmentBuffer` wiring) was deleted (one
mechanism). The shared path is byte-identical (PresetRegression + DB/FM accumulation green).

**Faithful-base choices (the corrected decode + the renders that drove them):**
- **Seed folded into the warp, volume-gated.** (431)'s only drawn geometry is a `wave_a 0.001`
  `modwavealphabyvolume` waveform whose role is to inject fresh palette-coloured content. Ported as a
  palette-tinted central core seed in the warp, gated by overall energy — faithful `modwavealphabyvolume`
  AND the "core brightness ← volume" musical route. A *constant* core floods the frame to opaque warm
  metal over ~16 s (anti-reference); gating keeps the silence ground dark (D-019) and makes the core
  pulse with audio. No separate waveform-geometry draw (the line is negligible-as-geometry).
- **`mv_x/mv_y` with `mv_a 0` does NOT advect** (it's the hidden Milkdrop debug-grid; the plan §4 was a
  misread, FA #73). Advection = zoom 1.009 + the slow roam sines only.
- **Bass kick from `bassDev`**, not (431)'s `bass_thresh` absolute-threshold hysteresis (FA #31).
- **Feedback clamped to `[0,1]`** (the source's 8-bit-UNORM store) — the unsharp + rectified grain bloom
  to white on an unclamped HDR buffer (the kickoff's documented fallback). `.rgba16Float` is kept for the
  NACRE.3 iridescence uplift's headroom but today carries `[0,1]`. Comp→drawable uses the FM sRGB-decode
  so the near-black ground survives the sRGB encode.
- **Cell scale is set by the unsharp blur WIDTH** (and grain frequency), not the comp's sine frequency:
  smooth feedback → big glassy cells, high-freq feedback → oil-slick flecks. A single wide inline gaussian
  stands in for (431)'s 3-level blur pyramid (deferred, NACRE_PLAN §9).

**Status / coverage.** **CERTIFIED NACRE.4** (Matt's live M7 — the connection lands via a display-stage
downbeat camera push; flash-safe + rubric-passed). Production coverage: `NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest`
(non-black + no-white-out at silence over the live `renderNacre` path) + the multi-pass flash harness.
`certified: true`. Exempt from `PresetAcceptanceTests` single-frame invariants (feedback-branch preset,
like DB/FM).

## D-172: Floret — faithful port of `Sunflower Passion` onto a dedicated mv_warp branch (FLORET.4)

**Decision.** Port butterchurn's `suksma - Rovastar - Sunflower Passion` as the certified preset **Floret**,
on its own `RenderPipeline+Floret` dedicated draw branch (`isFloret` discriminator) — the same
custom-warp+comp register as Nacre (the D-171 register). NOT a literal sunflower: a breathing, colour-cycling
3-fold radial fractal bloom on black. Faithful base first (FLORET.2b), then the M7-driven motion bundle.

**Architecture.** `floret_warp_fragment` = z² conformal feedback fold + energy-scaled 1/r² internal vortex
swirl + 4 colour-cycling seed-discs + `[0,1]` clamp; `floret_comp_fragment` = a 3-fold radial-pulse
unsharp-high-pass kaleidoscope + bass spin + downbeat camera push + bass-onset radial-shockwave kick +
sRGB-decode. `.rgba16Float` feedback (Nacre register). BUG-061-safe reduced-motion path.

**Motion (Matt's live M7, 5 rounds).** One primitive per channel (FA #67): beat-lock downbeat magnify ←
cached `barPhase01`; energy swell ← avg-stem EMA; bass spin ← `bassDev`; internal vortex swirl (energy-
scaled). **★ Drum sparkle was tried + REMOVED** — fine bright-points camouflage into an already-busy bright
field; a whole-field displacement (the bass kick) reads where points don't (FLORET_PLAN §12).

**Status.** **CERTIFIED FLORET.4** (Matt: "looks good"). Flash-safe (multi-pass harness, 0.00 flashes/s).
Exempt from `PresetAcceptanceTests` single-frame invariants (feedback-branch preset).

## D-173: Glaze — faithful port of `jelly showoff parade` onto a dedicated mv_warp branch (GLAZE.8)

**Decision.** Port butterchurn's `Flexi + stahlregen - jelly showoff parade` as the certified preset
**Glaze**, on its own `RenderPipeline+Glaze` dedicated draw branch (`isGlaze` discriminator) — the D-171
custom-warp+comp register. The catalog's **first physics-of-the-beat preset**: a 3-mass damped spring chain
*integrates* the audio into smooth physical momentum (sidesteps FA #4/#31 by construction).

**Architecture.** A 3-mass spring (CPU) anchored by bass↔other stem opposition (lateral) + fullness (lift)
drags a radial swirl-poke across an accreting feedback field; `glaze_warp_fragment` advects+decays+seeds
(the seed band rides the spring tail Y to fill the field); `glaze_comp_fragment` = a 3-level blur-pyramid
emboss/sheen + display-only HDR glossy bloom + the discrete downbeat camera push. Per-stem accents: drums
poke-punch, vocals glow. `.rgba16Float` feedback; BUG-061-safe reduced-motion path.

**Durable craft rules (earned on Glaze).** (1) **Sharpening is DISPLAY-only, never in the fed-back warp** —
an unsharp high-pass with feedback gain > 1 compounds into grain on a float buffer (the 8-bit source
quantises it; we can't); generalises to any mv_warp feedback preset (FA #64). (2) **Validate brightness/wash
at PLAYBACK LENGTH** (thousands of frames), never a 25 s render — the wash is a slow base-accumulation creep
over minutes. (3) **Connection on a smooth/integrated coupling needs a DISCRETE beat-locked visible motion on
top** (the downbeat camera push), not tuning the smooth layer harder (the Nacre precedent).

**Status.** **CERTIFIED GLAZE.8** (Matt's live M7 — the downbeat push lands the connection). Flash-safe
(multi-pass harness, 0.00 flashes/s). Stem-agnostic (`stem_affinity` empty). Exempt from
`PresetAcceptanceTests` single-frame invariants (feedback-branch preset).

## D-174: Filigree — physarum agent-network preset, certified as a loose energy-accompaniment (PHYS.5)

**Decision.** Ship **Filigree** — a living slime-mold network (physarum / neural web / river-delta) in the
Kintsugi palette (gold veins on pure black) — as the catalog's **first certified compute-agent-network
preset**. The form is the song's energy: the fine searching-web is the resting state, continuous energy
brightens/quickens it, structural peaks bloom consolidated veins (the inverse of the original sketch — chosen
from rendered evidence; FA #58, the form carries the music).

**Architecture.** `PhysarumGeometry` — a `ParticleGeometry` sibling (D-097, NOT a new render primitive) —
drives a 3-kernel physarum loop (`physarum_reset → _agents → _diffuse`, own MSL, no CC-BY-NC-SA source
copied) over an atomic deposit accumulator + ping-pong `r16Float` trail, drawn in particle mode. The
`Filigree.metal` `filigree_ground_fragment` is just the pure-black backdrop the trail covers. Audio coupling
(energyEnv / hitEnv from `stems.*EnergyDev`) is computed CPU-side in `PhysarumGeometry` and reaches the kernel
via `PhysConfig`, so the MSL-source rubric heuristic can't see it (`expectedAutomatedGate` false — the
Skein/Lumen slot-buffer precedent; Matt's M7 is the load-bearing gate).

**The substrate verdict (Matt-accepted, after 3 connection M7s).** Polarity: LOUD → fine/busy/bright web
(divide), QUIET → few calm cells (merge). The re-seed bursts on an energy surge to land the "divide" on a
musical moment; a per-beat `hit` pulse + a calm baseline keep motion event-driven, not frantic churn. But
physarum **ratchets to coarse irreversibly** (5 attempts confirmed; the only "divide" is a trail-wipe
re-seed), and on sustained-loud material the surge burst fires rarely and is redundant with the continuous
loud=fine read → it reads as **a loose energy-accompaniment, not tight event-sync.** Matt accepted that
verdict and certified on that basis. **Tightly-synced bidirectional cell merge/divide is reaction-diffusion's
domain → a separate future preset.**

**Status.** **CERTIFIED PHYS.5** (Matt's live M7). `certified: true` + FidelityRubric `certifiedPresets` +
`multiPassMeasured` + a real `renderFiligree` flash test (0.00 flashes/s, SAFE).

## D-175: Ricercar — contrapuntal visual-music painting; substrate decays to a light ground, not black (Ricercar.2)

**Decision.** Register **Ricercar** — a contrapuntal visual-music painting preset (Fischinger / color-organ
lineage; showcased on Bach BWV 565, built reusable) — and land its flowing-colour-field **substrate** first.
Ricercar reuses Skein's canvas-hold mv_warp machinery (D-142/D-143) but reconfigured: a divergence-free
curl-noise **flow warp** (`mvWarpPerVertex` returns `uv + curl(...)`) so deposited colour advects and merges,
instead of Skein's identity hold. `certified: false` (voices, audio routing, and cert arrive Ricercar.3.x→.7).

**The load-bearing refinement — decay toward a LIGHT GROUND, not black.** A flowing field needs decay < 1 (the
§1.4 "moving present with a fading memory," Matt-confirmed 2026-06-29), but the shared `mvWarp_fragment` decays
`prev × decay` → toward **black**, which fails silence-non-black (D-037) at rest. Ricercar therefore supplies
its own `ricercar_warp_fragment` (the per-prefix `<prefix>_warp_fragment` override — the `skein_warp_fragment` /
D-149 precedent; preset-side, auto-resolved by `PresetLoader.makeWarpPipelines`, **no engine work**, every other
mv_warp preset byte-identical) that advects AND blends toward a light ground: `mix(ground, prev, decay)`. The
field breathes back to light when idle → **D-037 satisfied by construction**, and it matches the `02_meso`
ink-plume-on-near-white reference. This refines RICERCAR_DESIGN §4's "pure preset config" to "pure preset config
+ one per-prefix warp-fragment override."

**Ricercar.2 scope.** Substrate only — colour is **hand-fed** (three drifting LOW/MID/HIGH lane-coloured masses
in `ricercar_geometry_fragment`; Path A / closed-form `f(features.time)`, no CPU state, no per-track seed yet).
The gate-before-the-gate (RICERCAR_DESIGN §7): does it read as flowing, merging painterly colour? Preset count
24 → 25.

## D-176: Ricercar concept revision — the orchestra painting itself, per-section painterly identity on Skein's engine

**Decision (Matt, 2026-06-29, after the Ricercar.2 substrate spike).** Replace Ricercar's concept. The
original — abstract weaving "voices" on a flowing colour-field substrate — is abandoned: a *passive* flowing
field reads as slick wallpaper, not art (the spike's smooth-blob + glossy-ribbon attempts both confirmed it;
clean procedural primitives — blobs, ribbons, gradients — plateau at "wallpaper" and structurally cannot be
*painterly*, which needs texture, ragged/feathered edges, pressure-taper, visible media).

**The locked concept.** Ricercar is **the orchestra painting itself**: each orchestral section has a distinct
painterly **identity — colour + weight + texture + material** — and the painting builds **in sync** with the
music. *Identity is the soul; sync is the second layer* (Matt's framing: "colour, weight, texture, and other
qualities per section of the orchestra, then the ability to sync"). Spirit of *Fantasia* (art emerging, the
music as the invisible painter), elegant + luminous — **not** a depicted artist (3D representational, declined),
**not** Skein's chaos.

**Architecture: build on Skein, don't reinvent (FA #73).** Skein's marks-on-top mv_warp engine (D-142/143/149)
already renders per-mark colour + viscosity/texture + weight + wet/dry sheen as convincing paint (M7-loved).
Ricercar = the **elegant/luminous sibling**: graceful *composed* strokes building a picture (vs Pollock drip)
on a **light** canvas with a luminous **Fantasia jewel-palette** (vs Skein's earthy drip). Section = frequency
**REGISTER** (no instrument separation, §6) — five register-archetypes (basses / brass / violas / violins /
flutes), each differing on *every* axis (colour / weight / texture / gloss / gesture) so the material reads the
section before the hue does.

**Consequences.** (1) The **Ricercar.2 flowing-colour substrate (D-175) is SUPERSEDED** — `Ricercar.metal` /
`.json` / `RicercarSubstrateTest` are rebuilt next increment (git history retains the spike; the
`ricercar_warp_fragment` decay-to-ground trick may or may not carry, TBD at build). (2) **Filigree compute-agent
voices + the Ricercar.3.x engine bridge are DROPPED** — section-marks use Skein's marks-on-top overlay, not
compute-agents, which removes the *only* engine touch (no `ParticleGeometry.rendersToFeedbackTexture`, no
`RenderPipeline+Draw` reroute; the RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY "Missing" feedback-canvas+agent-deposit row is no
longer on Ricercar's critical path). (3) RICERCAR_DESIGN.md §CONCEPT carries the revision + the five-section
identity table (the design center); the original §1.1 / §1.4 / §0 are marked superseded.

**Status.** Accepted (concept). Next: rewrite the increment plan around per-section painterly marks on Skein's
engine, then build — design spine recorded first (design upstream of code).

**References.** RICERCAR_DESIGN.md §CONCEPT (the five-section table). [D-142]/[D-143]/[D-149] (Skein painterly
engine, reused), [D-175] (the superseded substrate spike), [D-097] (siblings not subclasses — Ricercar is

## D-177: Instrument-family capture feasible via on-device recognition (not separation) — scoped, deferred

**Finding (Matt-directed spike, 2026-06-29).** Uzume cannot capture orchestral instrument families: 4-stem
Open-Unmix collapses all pitched orchestral content to "other," and register-bands are a weak proxy. This caps
the musicality of orchestral presets (Ricercar's whole concept, D-176 — Matt is holding its quality bar on it).

**The reframe.** Do NOT *separate* (isolate each family's audio — unsolved for orchestra: 2025 research, even
purpose-built family separators get 0–4.5 dB SDR; "MSS for classical music is an unsolved problem"). *Recognize*
instead — multi-label instrument **activity** detection, a tractable supervised problem with pretrained AudioSet
taggers (PANNs).

**Evidence.** PANNs CNN14 on two public-domain clips: (A) Sym5 i. (string-dominant) — strings captured strongly
+ dynamically (peak 0.74), brass correctly localized at the horn entry (t≈24 s); (B) Beethoven wind octet (no
strings) — Brass 0.58 / Clarinet 0.16 / Flute 0.13 top tags, and it **discriminates brass-led vs woodwind-led
moments within the ensemble** (brass 0.64↔0.06 as woodwinds go 0.04↔0.53), timpani ~0 (correct absence).
Family-level capture + discrimination + absence detection all work — a categorical leap over the status quo.
**Ceilings:** family-level only (over-calls specific instruments), cross-family confusion on sustained timbres,
buried families approximate (mitigate by driving off each family's own deviation, D-026).

**Architecture.** Supervised net via MPSGraph (D-009 = no-*CoreML* only; Beat This! / Open-Unmix precedent), run
on the 30 s preview clip (no live-latency constraint on the primary signal). Portability low-risk for a CNN.
Likely production pick: a MobileNet-class tagger (MobileNetV1-PANN / YAMNet) for budget + clean licensing.

**Decision.** Adopt **recognition (not separation)** as the path to instrument capture; **scope it as a discrete
~Beat This!-scale increment** (`docs/INSTRUMENT_FAMILY_CAPTURE_SCOPING.md` — work breakdown, candidate models,
risks, reproduction); **DEFER the build to a fresh session pending Matt's comparison with a competing musicality
idea** (Matt, 2026-06-29). Not committed to the roadmap until that comparison resolves.

**Status.** Accepted (finding + direction); build deferred pending the plan comparison.

## D-178: Phase TONAL — continuous harmonic state via the Tonal Interval Vector (TIV) — GO (Matt, 2026-07-08)

**Problem (TONAL.0 audit, 2026-07-08).** The pipeline has energy, beats, stems, centroid, pitch, mood — and **nothing about harmony as a position.** NACRE.3's "hue ← harmony" is actually centroid deviation (a brightness proxy); MITOSIS.2c's hue swings on the same proxy; K-S key estimation is F#-minor-biased (CENSUS.3: 35 %, median conf 0.53). Symbolic chord/key labels were correctly deferred at MV-3 (heavy, ML-shaped, unnecessary for visuals).

**The approach.** The **Tonal Interval Vector** (Bernardes et al. 2016, ← Harte tonal centroid + Chew spiral array): a weighted 12-point complex DFT of the chroma vector per MIR frame → position on the circle of fifths, consonance, tension against a decaying tonal center, harmonic-change flux. **No labels, no model, no new ML.**

**Scope guard.** TONAL is the **palette-coherence + long-arc channel**, NOT a sync channel (the MILKDROP_ARCHITECTURE finding stands — richness doesn't buy beat-connection). Related keys → related colours (hue on the circle of fifths); tonal tension → slow macro state; harmonic flux → an accent subordinate to the Audio Data Hierarchy (continuous energy stays primary). Design rule for all consumers: **relationships, never labels** (no note/chord names user-facing) and the medium is **hue/palette/motion, never brightness** (the NACRE lesson).

**The three decisions (code evidence in the scoping doc):** (1) **Chroma reuse — YES**, a 12-bin chroma is already computed per frame (`ChromaExtractor` → `MIRPipeline.latestChroma`, already consumed by `StructuralAnalyzer`), so TONAL.1 is a **consumer, not a new DSP stage**. Documented defect: the fold floors at 500 Hz (drops bass) → the likely root of the K-S F#-minor bias, which TIV *may* inherit as a phase offset (validated against §8.5 key ground truth). (2) **Float budget — exactly 5 contiguous FeatureVector pads** (`_pad8`…`_pad12`, floats 44–48); take all 5, zero slack. (3) **Input — full-mix existing chroma** (do-least); the consonance gate absorbs percussion/noise; stem-fed chroma parked (5–10 s latency + App→DSP boundary).

**Decision.** Adopt TIV as the harmonic-state representation; **scope as 4 increments** (TONAL.0 audit → .1 `TonalAnalyzer` infra → .2 dumper + corpus calibration → .3 first-preset M7). Infra and preset increments never bundled. **Matt GO (2026-07-08)**; first-preset consumer = **Nacre** (its description already claims harmony-hue → real TIV closes an honesty gap and is the cleanest "real signal vs proxy" M7).

**Status.** Accepted (Matt go/no-go, 2026-07-08). TONAL.1 (`TonalAnalyzer` infra) code-complete 2026-07-08 — floats 44–48 populated, 192 B held. TONAL.2a `TonalDumper` + TONAL.2b corpus calibration done 2026-07-08: 1000-track pilot (2.66M frames) validated TIV (per-genre consonance classical>jazz>…>hiphop), recalibrated the consonance gate (floor 0.12→0.05 — the placeholder sat at the corpus median), saturation p99s documented for TONAL.3 (`docs/diagnostics/TONAL_PILOT_REPORT.md`). No preset reads the floats yet. TONAL.1b (Cartograph fifths-phase + consonance trace rows) code-complete 2026-07-08. TONAL.3 (Nacre consumption — hue ← `tonal_phase_fifths` circle-of-fifths, saturation ← `tonal_consonance`) **M7 SIGNED OFF 2026-07-10 (round 2, Matt "looks good")** — Nacre keeps certification with the real harmony coupling. Round 1 read as "not sure" (harmony was active but MASKED by the faithful time rotation — ~13.7 palette cycles/song vs harmony's ±0.5); round 2 made harmony SET the hue position (clock demoted so a vamp holds). **Durable lesson: an additive-nudge-on-a-full-rotation is invisible — a harmony hue signal must SET the palette position, not offset a clock.** The whole TONAL phase (.0–.3) is complete; parked round-3 levers: tension→dispersion (fixture-breadth), widen mapping if too subtle.

## D-179: Skills architecture — increment-type-scoped protocols become progressively-disclosed skills (DOC.9, 2026-07-09)

**Problem.** CLAUDE.md is loaded into *every* session regardless of what the session does. At the D-161 cap it sat at ~6,700 estimated tokens, and much of that mass was increment-type-scoped: the full Increment Completion Protocol (fires only at closeout), the Defect Handling Protocol (fires only on a `BUG-*`/P0-P2), the pruning-pass procedure (fires every tenth increment), the five-layer Audio Data Hierarchy + Cold-Start Phase Contract and the reference-porting Failed Approaches (fire only during preset/shader work). A non-preset engine session paid the full token cost of preset-authoring lore it would never use, and vice-versa.

**Decision.** Move each increment-type-scoped protocol into a Claude Code skill under `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, which the harness loads only when the matching work begins (progressive disclosure). Five skills:

- **`closeout`** — the 8-part closeout report, mandatory `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` + `RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` updates, commit format, stop-and-report triggers. (The **no-push rule stays always-loaded in CLAUDE.md** — safety-critical, fires at any commit, not just closeout.)
- **`defect-handling`** — evidence-before-implementation, the instrument→diagnose→fix→validate→release-notes process, fix-increment doc obligations, domain artifact table, manual-validation requirements.
- **`doc-pruning`** — the five-pass pruning procedure + the D-161 ratchet. (The **token cap stays one-lined in CLAUDE.md** — it governs CLAUDE.md itself and its `DocIntegrityTests` gate is unchanged.)
- **`preset-session`** — canonical home (moved from CLAUDE.md) of the Audio Data Hierarchy Layers 2–5b, the Cold-Start Phase Contract, the one-primitive-per-layer routing rule, FA #27/#31/#67, and the preset-scoped escalation thresholds. Step 0 still points to `docs/PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`, which stays canonical (not absorbed).
- **`shader-authoring`** — GPU contract / quality-floor pointers, `mv_warp` obligations, and the desk-research/reference-porting discipline (FA #64/#65/#73).

**What stays in CLAUDE.md.** Cross-increment invariants only: the 6-line Audio Data Hierarchy headline (continuous-energy-primary, D-026 deviation, beat constraints), the no-push and token-cap safety rules, the general Authoring Discipline rules, Code Style, Handbook Index, Development Constraints. Migrated sections become 2–4-line pointers naming the skill and when it auto-applies. Relocated Failed Approaches keep gap-table rows so `#N` citations still resolve.

**Two rules this establishes.** (1) **Canonical-vs-pointer:** a skill is *canonical* for the protocol it owns and a *pointer* for what a handbook owns — duplicated prose between a skill and a handbook (or CLAUDE.md) is a bug; pick one home. (2) **Admission-test amendment (D-161 rule 2):** skills are now the *preferred demotion target* for an increment-type-scoped rule that fails the always-loaded admission test — ahead of handbooks/checklists — because they load exactly when the matching work happens.

**Enforcement.** `DocIntegrityTests.skillIntegrity` (DOC.9) gates: the five dirs each have a `SKILL.md`; frontmatter `name` matches the dir and `description` is non-empty ≤ 500 chars; every `docs/…` path token in a skill body resolves; every `D-###`/`FA #N` citation resolves (reusing the existing resolvers); and CLAUDE.md `.claude/skills/<name>` pointers reference only existing skills. `.claude/skills/` is un-gitignored — it is committed project source as of DOC.9.

**Outcome.** CLAUDE.md dropped from ~6,701 to ~3,164 estimated tokens (well under the 4,500 target and the 7,000 cap), with no cross-increment invariant lost.

## D-180: Per-preset audio route-coverage gate (QG.1, 2026-07-09)

**Context.** SR.1 built `PresetSessionReplay` after the AV.2.x cascade: 12+ increments shipped over Aurora Veil's Route 1 (vocals-pitch hue) while it fired 0 % of frames for ~5 months, every closeout claiming "the route works." SR.1 made the evidence *available* (a replay report per session) but kept it a **prose obligation** — a closeout still had to remember to run it, cite it, and be honest. Nothing failed a build when a route went dead. The failure class was diagnosable but not *gated*.

**Decision.** Mechanize per-route firing evidence as a standing test.

1. **`audio_routes` manifest** (SHADER_CRAFT §17.1). Every preset's JSON sidecar declares its routes: `{ "route": "<behaviour>", "primitive": "<FeatureVector/StemFeatures field>", "kind": "continuous|accent|structural|gate" }` (`gate` added at BUG-088 — an enable is not a driver). Decoded onto `PresetDescriptor.audioRoutes`. The manifest is the routing contract; **audit before declaring** — a declared route the shader doesn't read is as wrong as an unread route left undeclared (backfill enumerated each preset's `.metal` preamble *and* its CPU driver — `RenderPipeline+<Preset>.swift` / `<Preset>State.swift` / `<Preset>Geometry.swift`, where mv_warp and geometry presets consume most primitives).
2. **`RouteCoverageTests`** replays the canonical fixture set (`Fixtures/route_coverage/` — the three tempo fixtures through the production separation + analysis chain, FA #27) and asserts per route, per fixture: **continuous** = non-constant (stddev > 1e-5 — a liveness floor, not an amplitude bar; low-but-varying is a fixture-breadth note, not a defect); **accent** = ≥ 1 rising crossing above 0.02 per fixture (calibrated to the smallest-range accent primitive, `bassAttRel`); **structural** = the section index changes on ≥ 1 fixture (the set must contain a boundary). Un-gated (0.73 s over 145 routes) so the gate is always enforced.
3. **Certification wiring.** `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresetsDeclareAudioRoutes` requires a non-empty manifest for every certified preset; `RouteCoverageTests` independently reddens if any declared route is dead. Together: a preset cannot be certified without a manifest whose every route demonstrably fires on real music. `AudioRouteSchemaTests` rejects a `primitive` with no recordable CSV column (typo / unrecordable field).

**The load-bearing principle: a red route is the gate working.** When `RouteCoverageTests` reddens, the route's primitive did not fire — file it in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` as a route defect. **Never tune a floor to make it pass.** The one red surfaced during authoring (Nacre `bass_onset_kick`) was investigated to ground before acting: `bassAttRel` was demonstrably alive (7 rising crossings above 0.05 on there_there, sd 0.038) — a threshold-*calibration* artifact (an attack-relative deviation peaks below an energy-dev spike), not a dead route. The fix was to calibrate the accent threshold to the corpus's smallest-range primitive with the evidence documented, not to special-case the preset. Distinguishing "calibration against verified-alive data" from "tuning to hide a defect" is the discipline: verify the primitive is alive *first*, adjust the floor only if it is.

**Infrastructure built to reach the primitives (QG.1a–c).** `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` extended to write the features half offline (BeatGridAnalyzer grid install → FFTProcessor → MIRPipeline → MoodClassifier at the production cadence → `SessionRecorder.csvRow`); SessionRecorder CSV headers promoted to shared constants (a private generator copy had gone stale when IFC.4 appended columns); `SessionColumnSeries` added for by-name column access; 10 FeatureVector primitives that presets consume but the CSV never recorded appended to the features schema.

**Coverage boundary (honest limitation, QG.1.1).** The offline `StemAnalyzer` fixture cannot populate VisualizerEngine-CPU-computed `StemFeatures` fields (`cachedBassProportion`, `totalEnergySmoothed`, `auroraPalettePhase`, `auroraOrbitAzimuth`, `drumsEnergyDevSmoothed`) or `accumulatedAudioTime` (app-layer clock). Routes depending on these — Ferrofluid Ocean's spike-height and aurora, Dragon Bloom's tumble clock — are real live routes but unverifiable by this fixture mechanism, so they are **documented, not declared** (declaring would false-red a healthy route and mislabel it a defect). Verifying them needs a live-session fixture; sparse/bright-material fixtures (where `high`/`highMid`/`treble_att` and structural-confidence would exercise harder) are the same follow-up. `structural` coverage rides on `there_there` alone containing a boundary; `section_confidence` stays 0 on ≤30 s clips.

## D-181: Render-comparison sheet as the mandatory pre-commit perception step (QG.2)

**Context.** CLAUDE.md / PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md carried the prose rule "mid-session sanity checks are side-by-side comparisons against the named references." REVIEW.1 measured 35 % compliance — Claude Code mostly skipped it and self-judged "looks reasonable." Per the D-161 ratchet (violated twice → mechanize), the rule converts to a gate + a script.

**Decision.** `Scripts/compare_render.sh <preset> [session-dir]` composites the newest `RENDER_VISUAL=1` frames for a preset against every image in `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` into ONE sheet — reference left, render frames right, filenames burned into each panel — and prints the path. (No ImageMagick on the dev box; the compositor is a repo-native `swift` script, `Scripts/compare_render_composite.swift`, mirroring `PresetVisualReviewTests.buildContactSheet`.) Before EVERY tuning commit, a preset session must run it, **Read** the sheet, and write a **verdict table**: one row per mandatory trait from the reference README — `trait | reference filename | PASS/FAIL | what differs (one sentence)`. Anti-reference rows are mandatory. A FAIL must change the next action; committing with an unexplained FAIL requires stating why in the commit body.

**Scope guard.** No auto-scoring (no CLIP / dHash-vs-reference metric): the reader is Claude's eyes, and an uncalibrated similarity proxy would invite verdicts on a broken proxy ([D-064]). The sheet composites existing outputs only — no in-engine capture pipeline ([D-064](d)).

**Enforcement.** `docs/PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 1 step 5 (the canonical surface the `preset-session` skill points at); the sheet is the canonical closeout §3 artifact (CLAUDE.md §3); `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` surfaces the sheet path when a session produced one.

**References.** REVIEW.1 (compliance measurement), [D-161] (rulebook ratchet — violated-twice-mechanize), [D-064] (reference-README rubric + no-auto-score). `docs/PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`, `Scripts/compare_render.sh`.

## D-182: Per-paradigm multi-frame harness templates (QG.4, 2026-07-10)

**Context.** PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST Part 2 obligation 1 requires "write or extend the multi-frame harness FIRST — verify the live path is reachable from a test before any shader work." The rule exists because three Aurora Veil increments shipped green on single-frame `preset.pipelineState` tests while smearing in live playback: single-frame tests verify instantaneous output only and cannot catch a frame-to-frame accumulation regression. But only `mv_warp` had a reference harness (`AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest`); an author working a `staged` / `ray_march` / `feedback` preset had to build the multi-frame harness from scratch, so in practice the obligation was skipped and the smear class stayed open for those paradigms.

**Decision.** Give every rendering paradigm a named, env-gated reference harness that drives the *same dispatch path the live app uses*, all built on one shared spine so the obligation becomes a copy-adapt from a named template:

- `HarnessTemplateCore.swift` — the shared spine: `HARNESS_TEMPLATES=1` gate, zeroed silence audio buffers (fft/wave/stem/history), capture-texture alloc + one-shot clear + BGRA / rgba16Float readback, the per-frame silence FeatureVector, and metric hooks (non-degeneracy incl. half-float NaN, luma, and a dHash/Hamming pair byte-identical to `ArachneSpiderRenderTests` so goldens compare across the suite).
- `mv_warp` → `AuroraVeilMVWarpAccumulationTest` — re-based on the core (byte-identical assertions), scene → warp → compose → swap.
- `staged` → `StagedPathHarnessTemplate` (subject Arachne) — world → composite through the production `encodeStage` with slot-6 (web) / slot-7 (spider) bound; per-stage non-degenerate (non-constant + non-NaN + signal) + composite dHash golden.
- `ray_march` → `RayMarchPathHarnessTemplate` (subject Lumen Mosaic) — the live `RayMarchPipeline.render` seam (BUG-034 128-step parity): G-buffer → lighting → composite → post; non-degenerate + luma floor (BUG-016 guard) + composite dHash golden.
- `feedback` → `FeedbackPathHarnessTemplate` (subject Membrane, the only pure surface-mode feedback preset) — production `runWarpPass` → additive composite → ping-pong swap for 60 frames; the accumulator must stay between the D-037 non-black floor and saturation.

**A/B validation (each template catches a broken dispatch).** staged: unbinding the sampled world input (slot 13) → constant-dark composite → non-constant check fails. ray_march: unbinding the slot-8 follower → BUG-016 black cells (meanLuma 0.47→0.15) → golden trips (Hamming 33). feedback: skipping the compose pass → accumulator decays to 0.0 → the D-037 floor fails. Each was reddened then restored; goldens are hardware-specific (D-039, Apple Silicon / macOS 14+).

**Scope guard — env-gated, not in the default run.** Some subjects (60 frames × real pipelines) exceed the fast-gate timing budget, so all four gate on `HARNESS_TEMPLATES=1` (they skip in <1 ms in the default `swift test`) and are surfaced for preset increments via `closeout_evidence.sh` rather than folded into the parallel battery. Templates use production presets only (no bespoke harness `.metal`, FA #27 spirit).

## D-183: Signal health monitor — classify the input chain, don't just recover it (ASH.1, 2026-07-10)

**Context.** The RUNBOOK's signal-chain triage (peak-band levels, the output-device permission-invalidation trap, the sample-rate family) was a *manual* catalog — a human read `raw_tap.wav` after the fact. Two of the three failure modes fail silently at runtime: a default-output change invalidates the Screen-Recording grant and the tap keeps delivering zeros with no UI signal (the trap behind much of BUG-057's diagnosis cost), and a 96 kHz interface forces a resample the stem pipeline assumes away. [D-165] built *recovery* (the tap-reinstall backoff) but not *observability* — nothing classified the chain while it ran.

**Decision.** `SignalHealthMonitor` (engine, `public`) classifies input-chain health continuously from the raw pre-AGC tap. A rolling 5 s peak window plus the tap signal state produce one `SignalHealth` value — `peakBand` (healthy ≥ −12 dBFS / low −15…−12 / critical, the RUNBOOK bands), `deadTap`, `sampleRateMismatch` — published on state change to `session.log` (`SIGNAL_HEALTH:` line) and the debug overlay. ASH.1 is engine + debug surfacing only; user-facing surfacing and the "refuse to certify/record on degraded audio" product question are ASH.2.

**Boundaries that keep it honest.**
- **Observe, never steer.** The monitor does not touch `SilenceDetector`, the reinstall backoff, or AGC — that coupling is a future decision, not this increment. D-165 *acts*; D-183 *classifies*. They read the same silence signal for different jobs.
- **`deadTap` is a duration verdict, not a counter reach.** It fires after `.silent` persists ~45 s (past the [3,10,30]s reinstall backoff), gated to process-tap modes. This catches both the cold broken tap (`!hasEverDetectedSignal`) AND the mid-session device-switch trap (where `hasEverDetectedSignal == true`, so D-165's reinstall correctly stays its hand) — duration is the only discriminator observable from a zero stream that covers both. Accepted limitation: a very long deliberate pause also trips it; disambiguating pause-vs-dead from zeros alone is impossible, and the response is ASH.2's call.
- **Pre-AGC by construction.** Peak measures absolute level, which AGC normalizes away downstream — so the tap is the only place the reading is meaningful (same rationale as `InputLevelMonitor`, which grades quality green/yellow/red; `SignalHealthMonitor` is the sibling that adds the two failure-mode *flags* the level grade can't express).
- **Realtime discipline.** `ingest` is allocation-free per buffer (one vDSP peak reduction); classification, the CoreAudio output-rate query, and the `onHealthChanged` emit all run on a non-realtime queue.

**References.** [D-165] (silent-tap recovery — the machinery this observes but does not touch), `InputLevelMonitor` (peak/spectral quality grade sibling), RUNBOOK §"Signal health monitor" + §"Audio levels too low" + §"App captures silence" (the detector-to-remediation map), `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/AUDIO.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (ASH.1 row). Follow-up: ASH.2 (user-facing surfacing + degraded-audio certification policy).

## D-184: Signal-health surfacing + post-session chain analyzer (ASH.2, 2026-07-10)

**Context.** [D-183] built the classifier but surfaced it only to `session.log` + the debug overlay. A user whose chain is degraded still lost quality silently, and no session artifact carried a chain verdict — so an M7 review, reel recording, or fidelity closeout could run on degraded audio with nothing flagging it.

**Decision.** Three pieces, none of which gatekeep the user's music (Uzume degrades gracefully; it surfaces and continues):

1. **One user-facing toast.** A once-per-session `band=low` nudge (DECISION-NEEDED opt 1 — a single unobtrusive nudge, never repeated), reusing the existing `audioLevelsLow` case: the Spotify "Normalize Volume" remediation when the source is Spotify, generic otherwise. Wired in `PlaybackErrorBridge` off `engine.$signalHealth`. `sampleRateMismatch` stays overlay/log-only (remediation too setup-specific for a toast; RUNBOOK carries it).

2. **`ChainAnalyzer`** (Shared, `public`) grades a finished session dir and writes `chain_health.json` + a `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=<clean|degraded|broken> reasons=[…]` line. It runs **in-process** at the end of `SessionRecorder.finish()` (so every session self-grades) and **out-of-process** via `Scripts/analyze_session_chain.sh <dir>` (retroactive grading of old dirs) — one analyzer, two callers. Verdict inputs: raw_tap.wav peak (broken < −15, degraded −15…−12), and session.log scans for `SIGNAL_HEALTH deadTap=true` (broken), `band=low/critical`, `DRM silence`, and tap reinstalls (degraded). Missing artifacts are noted, never fatal — a pre-ASH dir grades on whatever is present.

**Boundaries that keep it honest.**
- **`deadTap` is card-only, not a second toast.** The `AudioStallOverlayView` fix-ladder card (D-165, `PlaybackErrorBridge` freshness poll) already raises at ~10 s of no-fresh-audio while playing, more prominently than a 45 s toast would, and already names the re-grant-Screen-Recording remediation. Adding a toast is redundant double-surfacing the codebase deliberately avoids (Matt's call). The `deadTap` signal still feeds the analyzer verdict.
- **★ The Love Rehab onset count is REPORTED, never gated — because it is AGC-invariant.** Task 3 was specced to catch a normalized/low-quality reel by counting sub-bass onsets against the validated 11-per-5 s reference (RUNBOOK step 4). This was **empirically falsified**: attenuating a real Love Rehab capture (−26 dB), dynamic-compressing + hard-limiting it (a faithful Spotify-Normalize model), and even −50 dB gain **all left the `beatBass` onset count at ~11-12/5 s**. That is AGC + spectral-flux onset detection working as designed (D-026: level-independent rhythm) — the onset count is a rhythm-density fingerprint, not a degradation signal; it only collapses on true signal loss (which peak/dead-tap already catch). **What actually catches normalization is the PEAK check** (Spotify Normalize lowers peak below −12 dBFS — RUNBOOK step 1). The analyzer records the onset median as an informational metric the reel operator can eyeball, but no verdict depends on it. Corollary: do not re-attempt an onset-count degradation detector on any AGC-normalized signal.
- **Does not gatekeep.** Playback, preparation, and session start never block on health state. No system or source-app setting is auto-changed. No Settings pane for thresholds — constants with doc comments.

## D-185: Aurora Veil reauthored as a faithful nimitz "Auroras" port (AV.7, 2026-07-19)

**Status.** Accepted. Supersedes the AV.5 footprint direction, which cited this D-number in `AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md` but was never written up and never shipped.

**Context.** Aurora Veil had churned across AV.2 → AV.6 without reaching certification. Each round added machinery on top of the nimitz recipe it was originally derived from: a Lawlor footprint `F(x)` to carve negative space, three parallax columns, a traveling band undulation, a rare-event drum kink, per-march-step traveling waves, and eight audio routes later curated to three. The shader also quietly drifted from the reference itself — the 3D ray march was flattened into a fake 2D column, `triNoise2d` grew a global `mm2(time * 0.10)` rotation nimitz never had, and the final gain was raised 1.8 → 2.4. The result read, in Matt's words, as "the right look, wrong expression" — a full-field wash. This is Failed Approach #65 in its purest form: components of a working reference negotiated away one at a time, each defensible in isolation, cumulatively fatal.

**Decision.** Stop deriving and port the reference.

1. **Faithful port.** nimitz (@stormoid), "Auroras", Shadertoy `XtGGRt` (2017), retyped into MSL with his algorithm and constants intact: the real 3D ray march (`ro`/`rd`, sampling `bpos.zx`), five-octave domain-warped triangular noise, the running-average smear (`avgCol = mix(avgCol, col2, 0.5)`) that turns noise into ribbon, the per-march-step `sin()` H(z) palette (Lawlor & Genetti, WSCG 2011), his `bg()`/`stars()`, his horizon fade and 1.8 gain. Every AV.2–AV.6 addition deleted. Adapted only for the harness: `iTime` → `f.time`, `gl_FragCoord` → `in.position.xy`, `iResolution` → baked 1080p, y-flip.

2. **Upward sky framing** (Matt, live review). The reflection branch and horizon are removed and the camera is pitched up (`kAuroraPitchUp = 0.60`) so the frame is sky end-to-end — vertical ray curtains overhead, matching the Lofoten-style references. **The camera pan was deleted, not merely slowed**: `stars()` is indexed by view direction, so any camera motion makes the whole starfield scintillate. Removing the pan fixed "stars twinkle too much" and "don't like the slow camera movement" with one change.

3. **Three non-competing reactivity axes** (one primitive per axis, per the routing rule):
   - **Stars → beat.** `bar_phase01` (downbeat, cached grid — not raw onsets), gated by `pulse_amp01` so it is silent at cold-start and silence, near-unison with a small per-star spread. Flash-safe *by footprint*: stars are sparse pinpoints, so even a unison pulse barely moves global luminance — measured 0.00 flashes/s.
   - **Brightness → mood envelope.** `f.arousal`, clamped to 0.85–1.15, plus a **subordinate** lift from `bass_att_rel` (`kBassLift = 0.20`).
   - **Colour → mood.** `f.valence` shifts the whole palette phase (±0.5 rad).

**Empirical findings worth keeping.**

- **★ Mood envelopes, not deviation primitives, are the right driver for a *gentle* response.** Measured on real captures: `bass_dev` is spiky (p50 = 0, max 2.3, 4× the frame-jerk of `bass_att_rel`); `mid_dev`/`treb_dev` are near-flat on real music (p95 ≈ 0.07 / 0.01) — too weak to drive anything. `arousal` and `valence` are smooth, well-distributed envelopes. Deviation primitives are correct for *transients*; they are the wrong tool when the brief is "gentle."
- **★ `bass_att_rel` is the gentle deviation primitive.** It is attack-enveloped upstream, so it satisfies the L2 continuous-energy gate (D-026) *and* stays smooth — no CPU-side EMA state required.
- **★ A crown-only colour shift is perceptually invisible.** nimitz's `exp2(-i * 0.065 - 2.5)` weighting means high march-steps contribute almost nothing to the final pixel. A hue shift applied to the crown is mathematically real and visually zero; it must be applied to the whole palette to be seen.
- **★ Beat-sync legibility is a property of the grid, not only the mapping.** On School of Seven Bells (dense reverb-washed dream-pop) the phase signals wrapped at rates inconsistent with the 153 BPM grid and `drift_ms` swung to −90 ms; the same star mapping read as correctly locked on Cherub Rock. Diagnose "not synced" against a percussive track before treating it as a shader bug.
- **A clamp truncates the driver it bounds.** Capping the breathe at 1.15 shrank the mood swing until a +11% bass lift rivalled it. When a bounded driver stops dominating its accent, lower the accent — do not relax the gate.

**Licensing.** nimitz's Shadertoy source is CC-BY-NC-SA; Uzume is MIT. Matt's explicit call (2026-07-19) was to ship the port credited, accepting the terms for this non-commercial project. Attribution to nimitz and to Lawlor & Genetti is carried in the shader header and the sidecar `author` field.

**Certification.** Certified 2026-07-19 on Matt's M7 sign-off across five live sessions. Automated gate `[✓] 3/4` (L4 is manual by definition); flash-safety MEASURED at 0.00 flashes/s; `PresetRegressionTests` goldens regenerated (the old hashes were 32–38 Hamming bits away — a different image by design, not drift).

**References.** [D-026] (deviation primitives), [D-029] (one rendering paradigm per preset), [D-037] (silence never renders black), [D-067] (lightweight rubric), [D-157] (bounded per-beat footprint + steady luminance), FA #65 (do not negotiate away a working reference), `docs/presets/AURORA_VEIL_DESIGN.md` §5.11, `docs/presets/AURORA_VEIL_RESEARCH_2026-05-18.md` §1.1 (the recipe), nimitz Shadertoy `XtGGRt`, Lawlor & Genetti (WSCG 2011).

## D-186: Glass Brutalist preset retired (GBRETIRE.1, 2026-07-19)

**Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, 2026-07-19).

**Decision.** Glass Brutalist is retired in its entirety. All preset code (`GlassBrutalist.metal`, `GlassBrutalist.json`), its dedicated tests (`GlassBrutalistTests`, `RayMarchSDFDiagnosticTests` — CPU SDF evaluation of the Glass Brutalist corridor — and the `GlassBrutalistValidationTests` JSON-validation suite inside `RayMarchDiagnosticTests`), and its visual reference set (`docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/glass_brutalist/`) are deleted. Recover from git history if a future architectural ray-march preset revives the concept. `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.expectedProductionPresetCount` drops **27 → 26**.

**Context — why the concept is non-viable, not just under-developed.** Glass Brutalist was the original ray-march scene preset (its Option-A design is the subject of D-020). Two structural problems make it fail the preset viability bar rather than a tuning target:

1. **D-020 permanence forecloses the musical role.** D-020 (architecture-stays-solid) was adopted precisely because three iterations of bass-driven beam/pillar/fin deformation all read as "broken or rubber." The rule leaves music driving only light, fog, camera, and a single subtle glass-fin slide — the concrete itself is *deliberately audio-static*. That makes an instrument (or any musical subject) structurally incapable of being the hero of the scene: the hero is a static building, and the audio reactivity is confined to ambient lighting garnish. Uzume's preset bar (iconic visual subject with a *load-bearing* musical role) cannot be met by a scene whose defining subject is contractually forbidden from responding to the music.
2. **2006-tier fidelity.** The board-form-concrete-corridor look reads as a mid-2000s demoscene interior, below the current visual quality floor; a rebuild (V.12 scope) was considered and abandoned.

**What survives.** D-020 stays Accepted — the architecture-stays-solid *rule* still governs any future architectural ray-march preset; it is annotated with a pointer to this retirement. The shared ray-march infrastructure (`RayMarchPipeline`, the deferred PBR path, `RayMarch.metal` / `IBL.metal` / `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms`, the generic `SceneUniformsConstructionTests` in `RayMarchDiagnosticTests`) is untouched — Kinetic Sculpture and Volumetric Lithograph still use it. The `.ssgi` pass declaration stays on the GPU contract though no production preset currently declares it (Glass Brutalist was the only one). `SceneUniforms.cameraForward.w` remains a preset-specific free lane (D-020's mechanism); it is simply unused now that its one consumer is gone.

**What was rejected.**

- **Keep it as a "reusable ray-march reference."** The shared ray-march path is the reusable asset and it survives independently; the Glass Brutalist implementation adds nothing the path doesn't already carry (siblings-not-subclasses, D-097). Keeping deleted-concept code as "infrastructure" is a named anti-pattern.
- **Rebuild the fidelity (V.12) and keep the concept.** Even at higher fidelity the D-020 constraint keeps the musical role hollow. Fidelity was the smaller of the two problems.

**Rule.** Glass Brutalist is gone. A future architectural ray-march preset starts from a new spec that either (a) solves the instrument-as-hero problem within D-020, or (b) proposes a deliberate D-020 exception with Matt's sign-off — not from undoing this deletion.

**Carry-forward.** GBRETIRE.1 executed under this decision. `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` roster survey + Recently-Completed updated; `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md`, `docs/ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Module Map, and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` all drop Glass Brutalist. GoldenSessionTests fixtures regenerated deterministically (Waveform, the sole `waveform`-family preset, inherits the mellow-jazz slots GB used to win — the same sole-family clustering already documented for Membrane; not a planning regression).

## D-187: Phase RMENV — ray-march render environment (multi-light + gallery IBL + backdrop)

**Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, 2026-07-20 — chose the engine investment over shipping Kinetic Sculpture as luminous glowing-wire).

> **Retention note (KSRETIRE.1 / D-188, 2026-07-20):** Kinetic Sculpture — the intended first consumer named throughout this decision — was retired before it opted into RMENV. The Phase RMENV engine work (multi-light `SceneUniforms`, `ibl_env`/gallery, per-preset background, `MultiLightSceneUniformsTests` + `IBLEnvironmentTests`) is **retained** as a completed opt-in capability with **no production consumer yet**; it awaits a future ray-march preset. Nothing below is reverted.

**Decision.** Add ray-march render-environment capability as a **shared, opt-in, byte-identical** engine feature, benefiting every ray-march preset (Lumen Mosaic, Ferrofluid Ocean, future architectural presets), with Kinetic Sculpture as the intended first consumer at KSRB.2 (retired before opting in — see retention note above):
1. **Multi-light deferred lighting** (RMENV.1) — up to 4 point lights (key/rim/fill/accent). `SceneUniforms` grows 128→240 B (light1/2/3 + `lightingParams`, appended after `sceneParamsB` so existing offsets never move); the lighting loop sums Cook-Torrance over `lightingParams.x` lights and shadows only light 0.
2. **Selectable IBL environment** (RMENV.2) — `PresetDescriptor.environment` selects `ibl_env` (0 = default interior, 1 = high-contrast gallery with HDR skylight strips) baked by `IBLManager(envType:)`, so a near-mirror has detail to reflect (fixes "chrome = putty").
3. **Per-preset background** (RMENV.3) — the miss path renders the environment (`lightingParams.y != 0`) so the visible backdrop matches the reflections.

**Why opt-in + byte-identical is the governing constraint.** Changing shared renderer code risks a catalog-wide golden re-baseline. Designing every capability so a preset that doesn't opt in produces bit-identical output (1-light loop is `0 + x`; env 0 bakes the same cubemap; bgEnv 0 keeps the sky path) means each increment's gate is simply "all existing ray-march goldens byte-identical" — verified green throughout (only Aurora Veil's pre-existing AV.6 drift). This is the model for future shared-renderer additions.

**GPU-contract note.** `SceneUniforms` is defined in four places that must stay in lockstep (`Common.metal`, `AudioFeatures+SceneUniforms.swift`, `PresetLoader+Preamble.swift`, `+WarpPreamble.swift`); a mismatch is silent memory corruption. Documented in ARCHITECTURE §Key Types / §GPU Contract.

**Deferred (was KSRB.2).** Production per-draw environment selection (a `RenderPipeline` IBLManager-per-envType cache + threading the descriptor's `environmentType` into `drawWithRayMarch`) — the render harnesses select per-preset today; production wiring was scoped for KSRB.2 but is **not yet built**, since KS was retired (KSRETIRE.1 / D-188) before opting in. It lands when a future ray-march preset consumes RMENV.

**Carry-forward.** RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY §3/§4 rows (multi-light, environment selection, per-preset background), SHADER_CRAFT §17 (`environment` key, multi-light `scene_lights`), ARCHITECTURE §Key Types, and `IBL.metal` updated. Tests: `MultiLightSceneUniformsTests`, `IBLEnvironmentTests`.

## D-188: Kinetic Sculpture preset retired (KSRETIRE.1, 2026-07-20)

**Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, 2026-07-20).

**Decision.** Kinetic Sculpture is retired in its entirety. All preset code (`KineticSculpture.metal`, `KineticSculpture.json`), its dedicated tests (`KineticSculptureTests`, the KS-only `KineticSculptureMotionGifHarness`), its design doc (`docs/presets/KINETIC_SCULPTURE_DESIGN.md`), and its visual reference set (`docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/kinetic_sculpture/`) are deleted. `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.expectedProductionPresetCount` drops **26 → 25** (certified count 14, unchanged by this retirement — KS was never certified; Aurora Veil certified at AV.7). Recover from git history if a future concept revives it.

**Context — why retired, not tuned.** Matt stopped the preset after several redesigns failed to find the right direction: the chrome-in-a-gallery look (the KSRB.1 rebuild + the Phase RMENV material lift built to serve it) read as a "tinker toy," and a subsequent psychedelic-iridescent pivot drifted into a different concept entirely rather than fixing Kinetic Sculpture. This is a concept-direction failure, not a fidelity or infrastructure gap. A fresh **psychedelic-geometry preset** will be authored separately, from a new spec — not by reviving this deletion.

**What survives — Phase RMENV (D-187) is retained.** The multi-light deferred lighting (`SceneUniforms` light1/2/3 + `lightingParams`), selectable IBL environment (`ibl_env` / `ibl_gallery_env`, `IBLManager.envType`), per-preset background (`RayMarch.metal` miss path), and `PresetDescriptor.environment` — plus `MultiLightSceneUniformsTests` and `IBLEnvironmentTests` — are all **kept, untouched**. RMENV was built as a shared, opt-in, byte-identical capability (D-187); Kinetic Sculpture was only its *intended* first consumer. With KS gone the capability has **no production consumer yet** — that is intentional per Matt: RMENV awaits a future ray-march preset and must **not** be deleted as "dead." The shared ray-march path (`RayMarchPipeline`, deferred PBR, `RayMarch.metal` / `IBL.metal` / `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms`) also stays — Volumetric Lithograph and Test Sphere still use it.

**Wiring removed.** `expectedProductionPresetCount` 26 → 25; `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate` KS entry removed (KS absent from `certifiedPresets`, unchanged); `PresetRegressionTests` KS golden + KSRB.1 comment removed; `PresetVisualReviewTests` KS argument removed; `MaxDurationFrameworkTests` KS row removed; `GoldenSessionTests` KS `makePreset` dropped and the one affected golden regenerated (Session C track 2 falls KS → Membrane, the runner-up mid-energy fit — every other slot byte-identical, a single-slot runner-up substitution, not a planning regression); `SessionRecorderTests` log literal repointed off KS. Shared-path comments that had named only Kinetic Sculpture (`RayMarch.metal`, `IBL.metal` `ibl_proc_env`, `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms.swift`, app `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift`) generalized.

**Carry-forward.** KSRETIRE.1 executed under this decision. `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (KSRB.1 + RMENV entries annotated, Milestone D roster 26 → 25, KSRETIRE.1 Recently-Completed), `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/PRESETS.md`, `docs/ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` (RMENV rows note KS retired, capability awaits a consumer), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Module Map, and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_DEV.md` all updated. D-187 annotated with a retention note pointing here.

## D-189: Truchet Loom — multiscale curved-Truchet density-mapping weave (PG.4.1, 2026-07-20)

**Status.** Accepted. Reviewable v1 (`certified: false`); per-beat tile flips + per-path hue teams are PG.4.2, deeper nesting/polish PG.4.3 (`PG_4_TRUCHET_LOOM.md §A9`).

**Context.** First build of Phase PG (psychedelic geometry). Chosen as the phase opener for lowest fidelity risk: pure crisp 2D op-art with strong published prior art, and it proves the phase's distinctive **complexity-mapping** routing strategy (musical busyness → geometric density) that none of the other four PG presets use.

**Decision.**

1. **Port, don't derive (FA #73).** Arc SDF is IQ's canonical two-quarter-arc Truchet tile (per-cell hash → one of two orientations → distance to nearer of two corner-centred r=0.5 circles; pieces join edge-to-edge into continuous winding paths). Multiscale recursion follows Carlson's "Multi-Scale Truchet Patterns" ½-scale rule (successive tiles halved, smaller drawn on top). Cross-referenced to IQ's multiscale Truchet (Shadertoy `4t3BW4`); its source was Cloudflare-blocked from offline retrieval, so the recursion is **authored from the published rule + IQ's arc recipe**, not copied line-for-line — the borrowed load-bearing components are the arc math and the ½-scale hierarchy.

2. **Density hero = smoothed `spectral_flux` (D-026-safe).** A continuous global subdivision `level` is a soft-saturation of a smoothed flux — a monotonic map of a continuous variable, **never an absolute threshold on an AGC-normalized energy band** (FA #31). Busy → level rises → the weave shatters into nested sub-tiles; sparse → level falls → tiles merge into large arcs. Subdivision **crossfades** (per-parent-cell smoothstep of `level − L`, per-parent hash jitter) so it animates rather than pops, and spreads across the field like a wave. Recursion capped at depth 3 (Restrained default, DECISION-NEEDED §9).

3. **Smoothing lands in `SpectralHistoryBuffer`, not a new binding.** SpectralHistory has no flux ring; rather than add a slot-6 EMA state buffer (per-preset app-layer wiring, a new binding) the smoother is a **single CPU-side EMA float** (`flux_smoothed`, idx 3390, FPS-independent τ≈0.35 s) written in `append()` into the buffer's reserved region. buffer(5) is already bound unconditionally on the direct pass, so the shader reads it with zero new plumbing. The regression/visual harnesses bind a zeroed history → level = base → deterministic coarse weave.

4. **Drift = `arousal` speed on an `f.time` baseline.** One audio primitive on the drift layer (arousal); `f.time` is the non-reactive wall-clock baseline (advances at silence, so the loom always drifts — D-037), not a second driver (FA #67). Silence (flux ≈ 0) → coarse large-arc weave over a deep-cobalt ground (non-black).

**Empirical findings worth keeping.**

- **★ When the target primitive has no existing history ring, extend the already-bound history buffer's reserved region before adding a new per-preset binding.** A single reserved EMA float in buffer(5) delivered "smoothed, no flicker" with a ~6-line engine change and no app-layer wiring — vs a NimbusState/AuroraVeilState-style slot-6 class + apply-branch plumbing + harness parity work.
- **★ `spectral_flux` is an unusually well-matched hero** — it *literally measures* the thing being mapped (broadband busyness) and is a recordable continuous route (`RouteCoverageTests` green on both declared routes).

## D-190: Truchet Loom rhythm + colour — per-beat flips, hue teams, glow (PG.4.2, 2026-07-20)

**Status.** Accepted. Builds on D-189 (PG.4.1). `certified: false`; PG.4.3 (deeper nesting, chromatic/grain/AA polish, possible curl-warp) remains.

**Context.** PG.4.1 shipped the density hero (smoothed `spectral_flux` → subdivision) + drift. PG.4.2 adds the §A3/§A4 rhythm + colour layers so the weave is a fuller readout of the arrangement: the beat re-routes the paths, brightness/harmony colour the ribbons.

**Decision.** Three routes, each on a distinct primitive/timescale (FA #67):

1. **Per-beat tile flips (rhythm).** On the cached-grid beat, a bounded ~22 % hash-selected subset of tiles re-route their Truchet arc. To make the subset EVOLVE beat to beat (not oscillate the same tiles), a new **`beat_index`** monotonic counter is added to `SpectralHistoryBuffer` (slot 3391), incremented CPU-side on each `beat_phase01` sawtooth wrap — same reserved-slot pattern as the D-189 flux EMA (no new binding). The flip crossfades over `beat_phase01` so it animates rather than pops, and is gated by `pulse_amp01` so cold-start/silence (where grid phase may be wrong) show the static weave. An orientation swap preserves per-cell ink, so global luminance stays steady — **measured beat luminance swing 0.0055** (D-157: bounded footprint + steady luminance, not a strobe).
2. **Per-path hue teams (colour).** Coarse spatial blocks (½ the base-tile frequency) get a **quantised** hue team; hues stay coherent along paths → coloured ribbons, not per-cell rainbow noise. `spectral_centroid` slowly phases the whole set. The deep-cobalt ground is fixed for op-art contrast.
3. **Bounded path glow (accent).** `bass_dev` drives a subtle additive glow weighted toward the freshly-subdivided (high-depth) ribbons. Explicitly drop-able if it competes at M7.

**Empirical findings worth keeping.**
- **★ The reserved-slot counter pattern generalises.** A monotonic per-beat index that a stateless direct fragment needs (to seed evolving per-beat state) is another single reserved float in `SpectralHistoryBuffer` — CPU detects the `beat_phase01` wrap, the shader reads one float. No slot-6 binding, no app wiring. (D-189 established this for a smoothed EMA; D-190 for an event counter.)
- **★ "Flip = orientation swap" is what makes per-beat motion D-157-safe.** Swapping a Truchet arc's orientation moves the ink without changing its area, so a bounded flipping subset barely moves global luminance (0.0055 swing measured) — the re-route reads as rhythm, never as a strobe. This is the general recipe for beat-locked motion on a coverage-based preset.
- Automated rubric gate rose to **3/4** (L1/L2/L3) once the in-source `bass_dev` read made the L2 deviation-primitive heuristic pass; the smoothed-flux hero remains invisible to that source scan (it lives in buffer 5). L4 (Matt's M7) is the load-bearing cert gate.

## D-191: Truchet Loom breakup polish — organic hue boundaries + grain (PG.4.3, scoped; 2026-07-21)

**Status.** Accepted. `certified: false`. A deliberately **scoped** PG.4.3: the §A2 "breakup" craft layer only, with the felt/density changes held for Matt's live M7.

**Context.** PG.4.3's design-doc scope (deeper nesting, finer motif variety, curl-warp, chromatic/grain/AA) is largely M7-gated: "deeper nesting" was explicitly conditional on "if peaks feel underwhelming at M7," and Matt chose **Restrained (cap 3)** at the PG.4.1 review; a curl-warp changes how the motion *feels*. Doing those before the preset's first live review risks polishing the wrong things (the mechanical-iteration failure mode). So PG.4.3 was scoped to the low-regret breakup work that improves the preset without pre-empting a decision Matt already made.

**Decision.**
1. **Organic hue-team boundaries.** The PG.4.2 hue teams snapped to a hard `floor()` square grid (a cosmetic defect flagged in the PG.4.2 closeout). The block-lookup coordinate is now domain-warped by a cheap single-octave value noise (`tl_vnoise` — 4 hash taps + smoothstep bilerp, centred) so team borders wander organically while regions stay coherent ("teams," not per-cell rainbow).
2. **Subtle paper grain.** A screen-anchored static grain (±0.014) on the final colour — the §A2 breakup scale — for a faint print texture that keeps the op-art crisp.

**Held for post-M7 (surfaced to Matt).** Deeper nesting toward cap 4 (reverses the Restrained pick); curl-warp organic flow (a felt-motion change). Both wait on the live review.

**Empirical findings worth keeping.**
- **★ Don't reach for fBM to warp a boundary.** The first cut used `fbm4` (4-octave `perlin3d`, ×2 per pixel) and blew p99 to 8.87 ms — over the 8 ms budget, on a preset whose whole premise is "very cheap 2D." A 4-tap single-octave value noise gives the same organic-boundary read at ~8× less cost (p95 2.2 ms). For a *soft displacement of a low-frequency field*, single-octave value noise is the right tool; fBM is for detail-rich surfaces (SHADER_CRAFT §3), not cheap domain warps. (FA #64-adjacent: measure perf on any per-pixel noise addition to a direct preset.)

**References.** D-189/D-190 (PG.4.1/4.2), [D-037], `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md` §3 (noise) / §9 (perf budgets), `docs/presets/psychedelic_geometry/PG_4_TRUCHET_LOOM.md` §A2 (breakup scale) / §A9.

## D-192: Audio-visual coupling metric — cross-correlation of visual delta vs. energy, report-first (QG.3)

**Context.** "The motion tracks the music" was unmeasurable — closeouts asserted it, the M7 seat judged it, but no instrument put a number on it. QG.3 builds that instrument so a dead-coupled route (visual delta uncorrelated with energy) is at least *partially* measurable before a human looks.

**Metric.** Per replay frame, a scalar **visual delta** = mean |luma(frame i) − luma(frame i−1)| over the 64×64 reduced-resolution render (0..1), written to `coupling/<preset>_<fixture>_visual_delta.csv`. **Coupling** = cross-correlation of that series against the `features.csv` energy envelope (composite = mean of `bass`/`mid`/`treble`, plus each band) at lags 0–500 ms — reported per pair as peak Pearson r, lag at peak, and a stationarity note (r over non-overlapping 10 s windows: min/median/max, so chorus-only coupling is visible). Pure-Swift/Accelerate; no new dependencies. **Negative control** (bounds the noise floor): fixture A's energy against fixture B's rendered frames — real audio mismatched to real frames (FA #27, no hand-authored envelope). Producer: `CouplingReportTests` (diagnostic suite, no content assertions; gated `UZUME_COUPLING=1` — the sweep renders ~50k frames).

**Report-first, no gate — and why the gate (QG.3.1) is deferred.** Verdicts on an uncalibrated proxy are forbidden (PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST Part 2). The QG.3 baseline (`docs/diagnostics/QG3_COUPLING_BASELINE.md`) surfaced a blocking finding: the offline render harness (reused from `PresetRegressionTests`) renders **one fragment with zeroed aux state** (slot-6 CPU accumulators, feedback history texture, mv_warp marks buffer — none reconstructable from CSV), so **11 of 13 certified presets render fully static offline** (`visual_delta = 0`) — the same reason those presets record identical dHashes across `PresetRegressionTests`' fixtures. Only Ferrofluid Ocean and Murmuration produce measurable output; only Murmuration/`love_rehab` (peak r +0.30) clears the +0.08 noise floor. **A gate needs a population; the measurable population is 2.** Prerequisite for QG.3.1: a headless multi-pass/state-reconstructing render. Provisional floor when that lands: peak composite r ≥ 0.15 (≈2× the noise ceiling) — a hypothesis to re-derive, not a committed threshold.

**Noise-floor caveat (load-bearing).** Peak-over-lag Pearson r is positively biased — max over ~22 lag candidates of noisy correlations inflates above 0. The negative control measures this at +0.08 (mismatched real pairs), which is the noise ceiling any real coupling must clear. This is why the control is mandatory and why raw r ≈ floor reads as "coupling not measured as present."

**Scope guard.** Low coupling is **never** interpreted as "preset is bad" in any doc — it is "coupling not measured as present"; the M7 seat judges feel (manual-validation rule stands). No preset is tuned in response to its number. Below-floor presets are route/coupling-defect candidates (→ KNOWN_ISSUES), but every below-floor result in the QG.3 baseline is a render-substrate measurement gap, not a defect, so **no KNOWN_ISSUES entry is filed**. The report is attached to preset closeouts (`Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` surfaces the baseline pointer), never asserted against.

**References.** `docs/diagnostics/QG3_COUPLING_BASELINE.md` (baseline table + control + recommended floor), `docs/diagnostics/QG1_REPLAY_AUDIT.md` (the "no headless render" gap this inherits), [D-180] (route-coverage gate + the CPU-computed StemFeatures fixture boundary), [D-193] (measurement substrate), `docs/ENGINE/SESSION_REPLAY.md` (SR.1 uncalibrated-proxy doctrine), FA #27 (no hand-authored envelopes). `CouplingReportTests.swift`.

## D-193: Coupling measurement substrate — shared multi-pass render, per-preset floor, warning-tier gate (QG.3.1)

**Context.** [D-192] shipped the coupling metric report-first and deferred the gate because the offline single-fragment/zeroed-state render made 11/13 certified presets render static (`visual_delta = 0`) — measurable for only 2. Matt's call (QG.3.1, "make measurable first; the gate flip becomes QG.3.2"): build the real render substrate, re-baseline, THEN recommend a floor.

**Decision — one shared faithful render.** The photosensitivity flash gate (`MultiPassFlashHarnessTests`) already drives all 10 multi-pass / feedback / follower presets headless through their REAL render loops with feedback persistence (mv_warp swap, rayMarch 128-step budget, ticked followers). Extract that render into a shared `MultiPassRenderHarness` parameterized by (drive train, per-frame pixel reducer). Two consumers now share ONE render (FA #66 — drive the live path, never reimplement): the flash gate (synthetic worst-case beat train → WCAG luminance → flash-rate) and the coupling report (REAL reconstructed-fixture train, FA #27 → luma field → visual delta). The 3 single-pass presets (Ferrofluid Ocean, Murmuration, Nimbus) read their response in one fragment (+ the ticked Nimbus CPU follower) and keep the single-fragment path. The flash gate's assertions are byte-identical after the extraction (verified: Dragon Bloom Δ0.904, Nacre 0.063–0.153, etc. unchanged).

**Finding — the distribution (all 13 measurable).** 11/13 clear their own noise floor with margin on at least one fixture (Skein +0.69, Dragon Bloom +0.47, Filigree +0.39, Lumen Mosaic +0.37, Fata Morgana +0.32, Murmuration +0.29, Mitosis +0.27, Floret +0.25, Nimbus +0.23, Cytokinesis +0.20, Glaze +0.13). Two read weak for PROXY reasons, not defects: **Nacre** (+0.05) couples via a subtle downbeat *camera push* that barely moves mean-abs frame delta; **Ferrofluid Ocean** (+0.08, at floor) is single-fragment-approximated (its faithful render needs post + a baked height field). Both are certified + M7-approved.

**The floor is PER-PRESET, not global.** Negative controls span −0.02…+0.13; Dragon Bloom's +0.13 is highest because long feedback trails autocorrelate the frame sequence (peak-over-lag r is also positively biased). A flat global floor would misjudge feedback presets. Judge each preset against its own control, on its best fixture (`there_there`/rock scores lowest everywhere — a low-dynamics fixture property, not a preset trait).

**Recommendation — QG.3.2 is a WARNING tier, not a hard cert gate.** A hard floor that catches genuinely-dead coupling would false-red the two M7-approved weak-reading presets — the "verdict on an uncalibrated proxy" failure this whole line of work exists to avoid ([D-064] doctrine). Ship QG.3.2 as a review flag (best-fixture peak r < 0.15 AND < control + 0.10 → "coupling not measured as present — review"), surfaced in closeout evidence, never a certification blocker. Validate the proxy against Matt's felt-coupling ordering (Nacre-low / Skein-high are the anchors) before any blocking gate. No KNOWN_ISSUES filed — no preset reads below its floor for a non-proxy reason.

## D-194: Truchet Loom retired — concept scrapped after first live M7 (TLRETIRE.1, 2026-07-21)

**Status.** Accepted. Retires the preset added at D-189/190/191 (PG.4.1/4.2/4.3). The preset's whole footprint is deleted; the reusable-looking `SpectralHistoryBuffer` slots built for it are removed too (no other consumer — a deleted concept does not earn "kernel waiting for the right concept" preservation, per CLAUDE.md §Authoring Discipline).

**Context.** Truchet Loom was the first Phase PG preset — a `direct` multiscale curved-Truchet weave whose subdivision depth tracked a smoothed `spectral_flux` (the "complexity-mapping" music idea). It shipped PG.4.1–4.3 green and `certified: false`. Its first live M7 (Matt, 2026-07-21) rejected it at the concept level, not the tuning level.

**Matt's M7 verdict (verbatim themes).** "I can see the square tiles used to construct the canvas." "Music causes the structure to jitter, which looks like a bug." "Any concept of loom is lost." "I don't understand what you are building and why this is 'psychedelic geometry.'" And on a proposed replacement look: "This doesn't sound interesting… I'm not interested in cheap. I'm interested in complex and meticulous, real craft and attention to detail."

**Root cause.** The design doc described the *look* with flowing fine-line scallop op-art references (`01_macro_labyrinth_floor.jpg`) but specified the *mechanic* as "port multiscale Truchet (IQ/Carlson)." Those are two different aesthetics — Truchet is a blocky geometric grid pattern; the references are flowing gridless line-art. The build followed the mechanic and drifted straight off the references. Both live complaints fall out of that: a Truchet weave IS a grid (so it "shows its tiles"), and "shatter into detail on busy music" means the pattern literally reshuffles (so it "jitters"). The clean stills hid both.

**Lessons worth keeping.**
- **★ Reference images are the source of truth for the LOOK.** A design-doc "port algorithm X" instruction must be validated to actually produce the reference look *before* building — a mechanic and a reference set can silently point at different aesthetics.
- **★ Stills lie about living presets.** Truchet's stills read as clean op-art; alive it was a jittering grid. Get MOTION + the real living behaviour in front of Matt early, and get the LOOK approved before wiring music (the KS spike-first lesson, re-learned).
- **★ Matt's craft bar: complex/meticulous/real-craft, not cheap.** "Deliverable / cheap / proven" is not a selling point for a preset direction; depth and detail are.
- Two PG-phase presets have now died at M7 on a fidelity/concept miss (Kinetic Sculpture, Truchet Loom) — the phase's "prove a routing strategy with a simple 2D mechanic" framing keeps under-delivering on craft; worth re-examining before building the remaining four.

**References.** D-189/190/191 (the retired preset), D-188 (Kinetic Sculpture retirement — the sibling M7-fidelity failure), CLAUDE.md §Authoring Discipline ("reusable infrastructure is not a defense for a failed concept"), `docs/PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 2 (musical-role + reference-grounding + stills-aren't-behaviours).

## D-195: Motion review gate — mechanize the pre-M7 temporal check (PG.MG, 2026-07-21)

**Status.** Accepted. Adds `Scripts/motion_gate.sh` + `PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 1 step 7. The temporal counterpart to the D-181 render-comparison sheet.

**Context / root cause it closes.** The still-review harness (`PresetVisualReviewTests` + `compare_render.sh`, D-181) renders exactly three disconnected frames per preset — `{silence,mid,beat}`. Temporal defects (jitter, structure-pop, strobe, freeze) leave no trace in a still sheet. Truchet Loom (D-194) passed still-review and jittered "like a bug" on its first live M7; that class of miss should never reach Matt's seat. The diagnosis that unblocked this: "I can't watch it move" was a false ceiling — frames extract, motion reconstructs from the sequence, and jitter is a measurable frame-to-frame delta (Matt, 2026-07-21: "extract every frame and piece together its motion… find the jitter through other data points").

**Mechanism.** `motion_gate.sh <preset> <frames-src>` accepts a video/gif or a directory of sequence PNGs (or the newest `RENDER_SEQUENCE` dump), then via ffmpeg computes the mean-luminance of each consecutive-frame difference — a per-frame motion-magnitude signal. Smooth flow → steady moderate values; jitter/pop/strobe → high-frequency spikes (`>3× median`); freeze → ~0. It stages ~8 evenly-spaced sample frames for the reader (Claude) to **view as a sequence** and points at the curated `target_animated.gif`. Verified end-to-end on `dragon_bloom/target_animated.gif` (0 spikes / 59 diffs — reads smooth, as a certified preset should).

**Boundaries.** Reader-is-the-eyes (D-064): the spike count is evidence; the smooth/on-concept/matches-reference **verdict is the reader's**, never an auto-pass. Deps are ffmpeg + python3 only (no ImageMagick — matches the dev box). The still sheet (D-181) is retained — the two are complementary (frame fidelity vs. temporal behaviour). The sequence **feed** — a contiguous `RENDER_SEQUENCE` dump — reuses `renderFrame` in `PresetVisualReviewTests`; it lands with the next preset that needs it (no preset in flight to render at authoring time). Existing certified presets regression-check today against their committed `target_animated.gif`.

**References.** D-181 (the still-sheet gate this parallels), D-064 (reader-is-the-eyes, no auto-scoring), D-194 (the Truchet miss it prevents), `PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` Part 1 step 7 + Part 2 ("reference images are still moments; presets are behaviours over time").

## D-196: Cymatic Resonance CR.1 maquette — plate + hero brightness→figure (CR.1, 2026-07-22)

**Status.** Accepted. First `direct`+`post_process` preset. `certified:false` (clay maquette, SHADER_CRAFT §2.2); pending Matt's live M7. Count 25 → 26.

**What landed.** A resonant square plate whose Chladni nodal figure is selected live by the music's brightness. `CymaticResonance.metal` renders the **plus-basis** eigenmode superposition `φ = cos(mπξ)cos(nπη) + cos(nπξ)cos(mπη)` (PORTED, ref Shadertoy 4dXSD2 — NOT its minus combination), crossfading two adjacent modes on a fixed complexity ladder; the crisp nodal set is a distance-to-zero-isoline ridge with `fwidth` isotropic AA (§18.3), displaced into relief whose normal is a §18.9 central-difference of a smooth height field, lit by one warm key + GGX (the depth cue), jewel-emissive on a deep-black plate, strong oblique tilt, through the shared ACES + bloom chain. `CymaticResonanceState` (slot 6) holds the EMA-smoothed `spectral_centroid` → ladder position (HERO), the `bassDev` fast-attack snap envelope (snap-to-simple), and the `smoothstep(0.02,0.06,totalStemEnergy)` D-019 warmup gate. Deviation/centroid primitives only, one primitive per layer (FA #67 / #31).

**Engine change.** `PostProcessChain.render`/`runScenePass` gained an optional `presetFragmentBuffer` bound at scene-pass fragment index 6, and `RenderPipeline+PostProcess` threads the live `directPresetFragmentBuffer` into it. This path (`drawWithPostProcess` → `runScenePass`) had **no production consumer** before CR (every ray-march post_process preset bypasses it via `runBloomAndComposite` with an externally-lit texture), so the change is byte-identical for all existing presets. `PresetLoader` already compiles a `post_process` preset's primary `pipelineState` for `.rgba16Float` (the HDR scene texture) — CR is the first to exercise that. `PresetRegressionTests` gained a matching `renderPostProcessFrame` branch (zeroed slot-6 = deterministic silence fundamental) so direct+post_process presets are golden-gated.

**★ Concept-gate correction #5 (found at the maquette, the value of rendering early).** The plus basis was adopted (correction #1) to kill the minus basis's main-diagonal nodal line (ξ=η, present on every figure). But the plus basis forces the **anti-diagonal** nodal line (η=1−ξ) whenever m,n have **opposite parity** — verified: `max|φ|` along η=1−ξ is exactly 0 for (1,2),(2,3),(3,4)… and 2 for (1,3),(2,4),(3,5)…. The design's adjacent-pair ladder `(1,2)(1,3)(2,3)…` is riddled with opposite-parity modes — **including the fundamental (1,2)**, the silence rest state — so half its figures rendered the very spurious diagonal the plus↔minus switch was meant to remove (starkly visible in the first silence render). Fixed by switching the ladder to the **same-parity `(m,m+2)` family `(1,3)…(11,13)`**: 4-fold symmetric AND diagonal-free on both diagonals, monotonic complexity coarse→fine. Same-parity is the load-bearing property, not the specific family.

**Evidence.** Embodiment (production PostProcessChain path, `CymaticResonanceVisualTests`): ridge-coverage litFraction bright 0.140 > dim 0.054 (finer figure with brightness) > drop 0.051 (snap-to-simple); structural pixel-diff dim↔bright 17.1, bright↔drop 17.9 (a real geometric change, not a colour shift). Silence non-black + calm (maxLuma > 4, meanLuma ≈ 7). Perf 1080p full-chain GPU p50/p95/p99 = 1.05 / 2.35 / 5.56 ms (≪ 7 ms Tier-2). Motion gate (60-frame centroid ramp + drop): mean 3.87, one spike at the intentional drop, zero frozen frames.

**Deferred to CR.2/CR.3.** Materials + four-scale micro cascade (thin-film, sand-accumulation band, fbm grain, roughness breakup); secondary audio (`arousal` excitation, `spectral_centroid`→valence IBL hue, drum ridge shimmer); optional shallow DOF; certification. **Open M7 tunes (one-line each):** does the (currently magenta-dominant) jewel palette read on the figure, and is the 11-step ladder length right.

## D-197: Cymatic Resonance CR.1.1 — live-M7 defect fixes + ASH critical-nudge gap (2026-07-22)

**Status.** Accepted. Fixes from Matt's first live M7 of CR.1 (track "Hummer", Smashing Pumpkins). `certified` stays false; pending a clean-chain re-M7.

**M7 findings + evidence.** Three preset issues + one infra gap, all diagnosed from the attached session (`2026-07-22T16-10-58Z`) before any code change (evidence-before-implementation):
1. **"Did not observe blooms — held its pattern throughout."** Root cause, proven from `features.csv`: on the session's *healthy* loud portion (2830 frames) `spectral_centroid` measured p5 0.085 / p50 0.110 / p95 0.162 / max 0.185 — a p5–p95 span of **0.077**. The CR.1 mapping `ladderTarget = centroid × (ladderCount−1)` assumed centroid ∈ [0,1], so this real band drove the ladder **< 1 of 11 rungs** → no visible morph. The exact Nimbus/BUG-027 AGC-calibration trap, now on the hero driver. NOT the chain (see below).
2. **"Palette looks white with a hint of magenta — no jewel tones."** The emissive gain (2.6) pushed the whole ridge over the bloom bright-pass threshold (0.9) → ACES washed it toward white; the white GGX key compounded it.
3. **"Plate leaves lots of white space."** The square plate was small/centred in the 16:9 frame.
4. **ASH gap (Matt: "don't we detect degradation?" → "the toast did not fire").** ASH *did* grade the capture `verdict=degraded [signal_health_band_low]` and logged live `SIGNAL_HEALTH: band=critical` for the first ~15 s (the quiet intro, peak −24 dBFS). But `PlaybackErrorBridge.handle(health:)` gated the live nudge on `peakBand == .low` only; the intro went `.critical` (< −15) → `.healthy` (≥ −12), skipping the `.low` window, and `.critical` was unwired — so no toast. A *worse* signal state produced no warning.

**Fixes (CR.1.1).**
- **Hero — centroid→ladder BLEND (Matt chose "blend" over pure-adaptive/pure-absolute).** `CymaticResonanceState`: `adaptNorm = clamp(0.5 + (centroidEMA − slowCentroid)·gain)` (deviation from a slow ~12 s per-track baseline — guarantees visible travel on ANY track, the thing that failed), blended `mix(absNorm, adaptNorm, 0.7)` with `absNorm` = the real centroid band [0.05,0.30]→[0,1] (keeps "brighter track ⇒ finer" cross-track meaning). Regression-locked: `ladderTraversalOnNarrowBand` replays the real [0.09,0.17] band and asserts > 3 rungs of travel (measured **3.75**; pre-fix < 1).
- **Palette.** Emissive 2.6→1.5 (ridge sits near the bloom threshold so hue survives ACES — only the brightest crests bloom white), white key → warm-gold `(1,0.82,0.52)`, hue sweep widened `0.58 + 0.50·r` + saturation 0.82→0.88 → a sapphire→magenta→gold jewel sweep across the plate.
- **Framing.** camDist 2.75→1.85, plateHalf 1.0→1.18, elev 52→48 → the (still-square) plate fills the 16:9 canvas edge-to-edge, thin dark strip at the receding far edge only.
- **ASH.** `PlaybackErrorBridge` nudges on `.low` OR `.critical` (test `test_criticalBand_firesAudioLevelsLowNudge`).
- **ASH "degraded only after loud" gate (Matt approved the follow-up, folded into CR.1.1).** Both surfaces now require the chain to have been observed `band=healthy` (loud) at least once before a low/critical window reads as degradation — so a quiet song intro (−24 dBFS on "Hummer") no longer false-flags on either the live nudge or the post-session verdict. Live: `PlaybackErrorBridge.hasSeenHealthyChain` latch. Post-session: `ChainAnalyzer.LogScan.bandLowAfterHealthy` (a low/critical SIGNAL_HEALTH line AFTER the first healthy one; lines are chronological) replaces "any low/critical line." Tests: `test_lowBeforeHealthy_doesNotNudge`, `quietIntroDoesNotFlagBandLow`. A never-loud chain is a dead-tap / silence case, covered by `deadTap` + the silence-extended path (not this gate).

**Boundary honoured.** The M7 was captured on a `degraded` chain — per the checklist, the fidelity read is weighted accordingly and this is **not** a close: CR.1.1 is code-complete pending a clean-chain live re-M7 ([[feedback_visual_fix_needs_live_m7]] / [[feedback_dont_waive_manual_gate]]). But the hero fix is proven against the real (degraded-or-not) centroid distribution, so it is decoupled from the chain state.

## D-198: Cymatic Resonance CR.1.2 — top-down framing, varied ladder, harmonic hue (2026-07-22)

**Status.** Accepted. Fixes from Matt's second live M7 of Cymatic Resonance (track "Cherub Rock", **clean** chain — verified `verdict=clean`, 0 low/critical windows, which also confirms the D-197 "degraded only after loud" gate works). `certified` stays false; pending the next live M7.

**M7 findings + fixes.**
1. **"Plate does not fill the whole frame — edge-to-edge at the bottom, but the angle leaves background at the top. Camera directly above would be better."** The oblique-tilt ray-plane always leaves a receding-background wedge above the plate's far edge (a geometric inevitability of a finite tilted plane short of the horizon). **Fix:** replaced the ray-plane with a **top-down orthographic cover-fit** — `plate = float2(ndc.x, ndc.y/aspect) * kTopZoom`, `viewDir = (0,1,0)`. At `kTopZoom = 1` the square plate's full width maps to the frame width and the centre-height band fills the rest → the frame is entirely plate, no background. (Cover-fit crops the figure's top/bottom; the derived-normal relief + GGX still light the ridges from an angled key, so it reads dimensional from above.) The strong-oblique-tilt of concept-gate correction #3 is **superseded by Matt's live call** — his direct instruction outranks the reference-forced framing.
2. **"Moves more this time, but not through more than 3 different patterns — a bit boring."** The `(m,m+2)` ladder is uniform (every rung a grid at rising density → low inter-rung variety), and the traversal was ~3–4 rungs. **Fix:** (a) centroid-deviation gain 8→12 (wider traversal), (b) a **varied same-parity ladder** `(1,3)(2,2)(2,4)(3,3)(3,5)(4,4)(2,6)(4,6)(5,5)(3,7)(5,7)` — alternating `m=n` concentric-grid figures with `m<n` cross-hatch so adjacent rungs are distinct *characters* (verified in render: peanut → concentric-square-with-ring → 4-fold cloverleaf), still all same-parity (diagonal-free, correction #5). Snap depth 0.9→0.65 so the drop lands on a present simple figure, not the near-empty fundamental (top-down zoom makes the lowest modes read empty).
3. **"The colour of the sand doesn't change — not sure where the visual interest is."** CR.1's palette was fixed spatial iridescence. **Fix (brought forward from CR.3):** a music-driven global hue offset added to the spatial sweep, driven by the **smoothed harmonic phase** `tonal_phase_fifths` (D-178 — "relationships, not labels; hue, not brightness"; measured range 6.25 = full ±π on the track, the most-alive primitive). It is a circular quantity, so `CymaticResonanceState` smooths sin/cos (τ 1.5 s) and recombines via `atan2` — never the raw ±π sawtooth; hue is also circular so the map wraps seamlessly. One-primitive-per-layer holds (FA #67): ladder = `spectral_centroid`, snap = `bass_dev`, hue = `tonal_phase_fifths` — three distinct primitives, three musical dimensions. Route declared in the sidecar; `RouteCoverageTests` green.

**Boundaries.** Color-on-music was scoped to CR.3 but pulled forward on Matt's explicit M7 ask ("where's the visual interest"). Materials + micro-cascade (CR.2) and the remaining secondary audio (`arousal` excitation, drum ridge shimmer) + certification (CR.3) still follow. The top-down cover-fit trades seeing the whole figure for a full-frame fill (Matt's stated preference); if he later wants the whole figure, `kTopZoom > 1` (with a returning background) or a rectangular-plate eigenbasis are the levers.

**References.** D-196 / D-197 (CR.1 / CR.1.1), D-178 (tonal→hue), D-022 (mood→colour, the alternative hue driver), FA #67 (one primitive per layer), SHADER_CRAFT §18.9 (derived normal).

## D-199: Cymatic Resonance CR.2 — rebuilt as vibrating sand (2026-07-22)

**Status.** Accepted. Cymatic Resonance is rebuilt from a `direct+post_process` figure-shader (CR.1/1.1/1.2) into a `feedback+particles` vibrating-sand particle simulation. `certified` stays false; pending Matt's live M7 of the rebuild.

**Why the figure-shader was retired (Matt's 3rd M7, "Cherub Rock").** After the CR.1.1/1.2 fixes landed and were confirmed *working* on the data (centroid, tonal, bass_dev all moving), Matt's read was concept-level: *"the primary focus should be on music reactivity… there's not a clear connection between the music and the movement… so much of the reference is about resonance/vibration and yet that's not something I'm seeing here… I can see traces of the dots… the construction looks shoddy."* Diagnosis (a genuine change from the prior two rounds, which is why the escalation fired instead of another tuning pass): **the preset rendered the RESULT of resonance — a nodal figure — as a static lit relief that slowly crossfades. The references are about the PHENOMENON: a plate vibrating, sand jumping and re-forming in response to sound.** A slow smoothed crossfade between still figures is an inherently abstract connection that can't read as "reacting to the music"; vibrating sand can. This was the escalation threshold (2+ M7s, root cause finally articulable + changed) — I stopped tuning and brought the fork to Matt, who chose the vibrating-sand rebuild.

**What it is now (PORT, not derivation — FA #73, at Matt's prompting "this is a solved problem").** The canonical model is the **vibration-driven random walk** (Zhou et al., *Physics Letters A* 2017): sand bounces on the plate with a mean step length ∝ the local vibration amplitude, in a random direction, accumulating at the nodal lines (amplitude ≈ 0). Ported from luciopaiva/chladni (MIT) — `pos += random·vibration + gradientDrift·toNode` — with the amplitude-proportional variant (addiebarron/chladni). `CymaticSandGeometry` (a `ParticleGeometry` sibling, D-097, on the Physarum/Filigree template) runs ~400K grains through `sand_reset → sand_grains → sand_diffuse` each frame, depositing onto a diffusing density texture drawn as glowing jewel sand. The plate field is the same plus-basis same-parity eigenmode ladder (correction #5).

**Music coupling (direct + visible, one primitive per layer, FA #67).** Loudness (energy, stems+fullmix blend) → how hard the whole plate vibrates; `bass_dev`/`drumsEnergyDev` → a beat burst (grains jump, resettle); `spectral_centroid` (the D-197 deviation-blend) → which mode → and a mode change makes grains on the old lines (now antinodes) **scatter and re-collect** into the new figure (the visceral connection); `tonal_phase_fifths` → jewel hue. Prototype look/motion proven on a synthetic arc (Matt: "looks better, shows promise"); `CymaticSandSketchRenderTests` renders the sequence + a non-degenerate gate (sand forms bright lines, not a wash).

**Wiring.** `passes: ["feedback","particles"]`, `fragment_function: cymatic_ground_fragment` (black ground; the sand draws on top — Filigree pattern), family `geometric`. Registered in `ParticleGeometryRegistry` (removed from `StatefulRuntimeRegistry`); app factory `makeCymaticSandGeometry` + `resolveParticleGeometry`. Retired: `CymaticResonanceState.swift` (its music logic moved into the geometry), `CymaticResonanceVisualTests.swift` (figure-render tests), the CR PresetRegression golden (particle presets with a black ground carry none, like Filigree). The CR.1 `PostProcessChain` slot-6 threading (D-196) stays as general infra (now no consumer — a future direct+post_process preset would use it). Count unchanged (26; a rebuild, not add/remove).

**CR.2.1 tuning (first live M7 of the rebuild, "Hummer", clean chain — Matt: "it's cool, but highly repetitive once the full band kicks in, cycling between 2 patterns; expected more grain motion in louder passages").** Two fixes: (1) **mode wander** — the centroid barely varies loud-or-quiet on real tracks (Hummer: same 0.08–0.17 band), so the mode locked on ~2 figures; added a beat + energy-driven continuous wander (two incommensurate sines, drift rate ∝ energy + beat) AROUND the centroid baseline, so the figure keeps stepping through varied modes when the music is busy. (2) **more vibration on loud** — real energy tops ~0.45, so the linear energy→vibration term was weak; raised the gain (drive `0.15 + 3.2·energy + beatBurst`) + `vibAmp` 2.2→2.9 + `gradientDrift` 1.7→2.2 (so grains still concentrate under the stronger shake). Look re-proven on the synthetic arc (distinct modes across the sequence; lines hold); pending Matt's next live M7. **CR.2.2 (2nd rebuild M7, "Cherub Rock" — "looks better; more variety if possible; connection feels loose but works"):** added a **beat kick** — each beat rising edge steps the mode wander forward (0.5 rad) so the figure visibly changes ON the beat (variety tied to the music → tighter connection, not just autonomous drift); wander amp 3.6→4.4 + a 3rd incommensurate sine (more modes, less obvious cycle). ★ Matt's own read: single-track variety is inherently bounded (Cherub Rock centroid span 0.168 — the mode can only vary via the wander); the real variety comes from a **wider playlist** (cross-track centroid/energy/harmony), which Matt will test next. **CR.2.3 (13-track playlist M7 — "Windowlicker reveals the bass reaction is laggy; connection feels loose"):** diagnosed the response chain as low-passing the music (vibration driven by a 0.25 s-smoothed energy → ~¼ s late on transients; the diffuse sand + density persistence smear sharp events). Fixes A+B (Matt approved): (A) **transient-dominant drive** — the vibration now rides the near-zero-latency beat burst heavily (`drive = 0.15 + 1.6·energy + 4.0·beatBurst`, beat-burst clamp 1.5→2.4), so a bass hit throws the sand immediately (~8× spike vs between-beats, 12 ms envelope not 250 ms); (B) **less smear** — density decay 0.40→0.22, `gradientDrift` 2.2→3.1 (faster settle), energyEnv τ 0.25→0.18. Deferred: (C) cached-BeatGrid `beat_phase01` timing for anticipatory tight beat-sync (the bigger lever, D-153/D-157) — Matt's call after seeing A+B. Honest ceiling: sand is an integrating medium — best at continuous energy, softer on razor-sharp beats. **CR.2.4 (cert-path, aspect fix):** the square 720² sim was stretched to the 16:9 frame; added a display **cover-fit** in `sand_density_fragment` (frame aspect threaded via `SandConfig.aspect`, set from `features.aspectRatio` in `render()`) — the square plate now fills the width undistorted, cropping a receding top/bottom band (verified: the central nodal ring renders a proper circle, not an ellipse). **CR.2.5 (cert-path, flash-safety):** added the `renderCymaticSand` seam to `MultiPassRenderHarness` + a `cymaticResonanceIsFlashSafe` gate in `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` + CR in `multiPassMeasured`. **MEASURED flash-safe: peak 0.00 flashes/s, 0 transitions** (Δ0.078 luma → a valid non-static measurement) under the worst-case beat train — as reasoned, sand is conserved (grains move, never appear/disappear) so global luminance stays steady. **CR.2.6 (cert-path, perf):** measured 1080p GPU p50/p95/p99 = **0.45 / 0.74 / 0.88 ms** (720² grid · 400K grains · 3 compute passes + fullscreen render) — ~10× under the 7 ms Tier-2 budget; the sim cost is fixed by grid+grains (display-res-independent). No N-cap needed at any tier; ~7 ms of headroom is a lever for a finer grid / more grains later if wanted. `CymaticSandSketchRenderTests.performance` (CR_PERF-gated). **CR.2.7 — CERTIFIED (Matt M7 "looks good", 2026-07-22).** After the whole CR.2.x tuning arc (wander, transient-dominant bass response, aspect cover-fit) validated live across a 13-track playlist, Matt signed off. Flipped `certified:true` + added to `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets`; the flash-safety (0.00 flashes/s), route-coverage (6 routes green), rubric, and acceptance gates now all ENFORCE for CR (PresetAcceptance "readable form" exempted like Filigree — form is the geometry, not the ground fragment). `target_animated.gif` committed. **Roster: 15 certified.** ★ Note: the formal cert sign-off is Matt's live judgment across the playlist arc — the last attached session dir was empty (recorder captured 0 frames), and prior playlist captures graded `degraded` on track-transition gaps, not on actual degraded audio during playback.

## D-200: Kleinian Froth retired — abandoned after live M7 (KFRETIRE.1, 2026-07-22)

**Status.** Accepted. Retires Kleinian Froth (built as KF.1). The preset never permanently landed on `main` — it was authored on branch `claude/kleinian-froth-design-04598d`, fast-forwarded to `main` for a single live test, then reset back off. There is nothing to delete from `main`; the production preset count stays 26. This entry is the durable record of the attempt + the lessons. Code is recoverable from the branch if ever revived.

**Context.** KF.1 shipped green as a `ray_march` (static camera) + `post_process` "clay maquette": `sceneSDF` ported Inigo Quilez's "Apollonian" sphere-inversion distance estimator (shadertoy.com/view/4ds3zn, per FA #73), with a sustained-bass packing morph (`f.bass_att` → the Apollonian `s` parameter). All targeted gates were green (compile/count, regression golden, route-coverage, fidelity gate, ray-march dispatch); app tests + lint + doc gates green. It was fast-forwarded to Matt's checkout for the first live test.

**Matt's M7 verdict (verbatim themes).** "This looks like complete garbage. I have no idea how to direct you. I hate everything I see." / "the entire LOOK of the preset is a failure." / "The look describes BUBBLES. Where are the bubbles within bubbles?" / the froth-inflation behaviour "was not visible."

**Two distinct failures.**
1. **Behaviour invisible — a calibration miss.** The hero mapped `f.bass_att` → packing parameter, tuned so the froth fully inflated at `bass_att ≈ 1.0`. But `f.bass_att` is AGC-normalised and its REAL operating range on the live test track ("One More Time") was p10 0.084 / p50 0.105 / p90 0.266 / p99 0.300 / max 0.328 — it never approaches 1.0. So on real music the packing only moved between s≈1.05 and s≈1.13 — an invisible sliver near the relaxed pole. The froth never inflated. The synthetic review fixtures used `bass_att` = 0 / 0.45 / 0.9, which spanned the full range and made a dead morph look dramatic in stills. (memory: "devs/loudness spike to ~p99 on real music; tune vs p99, never vs 1.0" — violated directly.)
2. **Wrong geometry + an infrastructure gap.** IQ's Apollonian DE renders the fractal's *limit surface* — a knobby "bulbs and horns" gasket — NOT round nested translucent bubbles. Real "bubbles within bubbles" (the curated soap-foam hero, `01_macro_soap_foam.jpg`) is two things this approach doesn't do: (a) an actual sphere **packing** (discrete round spheres, smaller ones nested in the gaps) — needs a sphere-packing SDF, not a limit-set DE; and (b) **translucency** so bubbles are visible through/behind other bubbles — which hits the single-hit deferred G-buffer wall (the pipeline shades only the front surface; multi-hit transparency does not exist). Both were Gate-2 (deliverable at fidelity) / Gate-3 (infrastructure) failures that should have blocked the concept. The transparency limit was even *written into* the design's Gate-3 caveat and the preset was built anyway — surfacing a risk is not the same as respecting it.

**★ Deep root cause (Matt: "What were YOU trying to build?").** The build was graded against the prompt's *mechanism* ("port IQ Apollonian") and the green technical gates, never against the curated soap-foam **reference** in the folder. A knobby pod-cluster was labelled "nested bubbles ✓" by checking it against the author's own description instead of the reference photo. The maquette was validated against the wrong answer key — twice — before a real eye saw it.

**Lessons worth keeping.**
- **★ Validate that a "port algorithm X" instruction actually produces the REFERENCE look before building.** This is now the THIRD PG-slate preset to die at M7 on exactly this reference-vs-mechanism mismatch (Kinetic Sculpture D-188, Truchet Loom D-194, Kleinian Froth D-200). The rule already exists (D-194, PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST Part 2); the recurrence means it is not being applied — hold the reference image next to the first render and ask "are these the same thing?" as gate zero.
- **★ Kill a concept at the concept gate when its fidelity depends on renderer capability we lack.** Here: see-through nested bubbles needs multi-hit transparency the deferred ray-march pipeline doesn't have. Flagging the gap in the design doc and proceeding is the anti-pattern; a Gate-3 gap is a stop, not a footnote.
- **★ Calibrate audio→visual mappings against the MEASURED real-signal range (p10/p99 from a live session), never the synthetic-fixture [0,1] range.** Synthetic fixtures make dead mappings look alive; the live signal is the only truth (memory: "don't close a felt bug on synthetic-fixture green").
- **Get MOTION on real audio in front of Matt before claiming a behaviour works** (D-195 motion gate) — the whole "not visible" failure would have been caught by replaying the real bass envelope as a sequence.
- Three of the PG-slate presets have now been abandoned at M7 on craft/concept misses. The pattern is strong enough to re-examine the slate/process itself (the HDR-realm slate authoring), not just each preset.

## D-201: Fractal Fly-By retired — instrument-proven motion-coherence ceiling (FLY.14, 2026-07-25)

**Decision.** Retire Fractal Fly-By and close BUG-071 as wontfix. Matt's call after the FLY.13 live M7 ("deranged movement, very jittery, still passes through walls most of the time"), presented with the evidence below and a recommendation to retire.

**The evidence that ended it** (session `2026-07-25T18-55-51Z`, replayed through the real `RayMarchPipeline` at window size via `SessionReplayHarness`):
- Whole-frame temporal difference: **~13 % of the image changes every single frame, uniformly** (not spiky — 0 % of frames are >2.5× the median jump). A smooth glide would sit at a few percent (edge parallax only).
- Frames two apart are **more** different than adjacent frames (diff-2 / diff-1 = 1.12). Coherent motion gives a ratio < 1. This rules out an alternating reprojection/jitter artifact — the geometry genuinely teleports.
- Six *consecutive* rendered frames (a tenth of a second) share almost no structure.

**Root cause — the core mechanic, not a bug.** A fast scale-zoom toward a fixed boundary point of a self-similar Mandelbox reveals entirely new fold structure every frame. There is no shared structure across frames for the eye — or for MetalFX temporal reprojection — to track, so it reads as boiling/teleporting. Coherence would require ~3–4× slower travel (the "slow progression through a monotonous tunnel, BORING" Matt rejected earlier this saga) and would *still* shimmer on the fine detail. Horsthuis-class fly-throughs achieve coherence via offline accumulation/supersampling we cannot afford at 7 ms / 60 fps.

**Why 14 rounds.** The dominant defect (motion incoherence) was never the thing being fixed. Rounds addressed direction, darkness, colour aliasing, camera-jitter accumulation, light starvation, then three rounds of lateral steering (FLY.12/13: avoid-walls + rate-limit + density governor) — each measured against peripheral metrics (lateral-jerk, mush %) that *agreed with the work*. Those guarantees held as measured (0 % jerk-spikes, 0 % all-wall frames) and were irrelevant to what Matt saw. The one metric that mattered — whole-frame temporal coherence — was not built until round 14, and it answered the question immediately.

**Removed.** `FractalFlyBy.metal` + `.json` (roster is scan-discovered, so deleting the files removes it); `RayMarchPipeline+Corridor.swift` + the corridor stored props + the `steerCorridor()` call (FLY.12/13 steering — FFB was its only consumer, so per D-097 it is deleted, not kept as a "reusable kernel"); the `presetSteer` SceneUniforms float4 lane across the Swift struct + the Common.metal / PresetLoader+Preamble.swift MSL mirrors (WarpPreamble never had it) — this **restores the 240-byte D-187 layout contract**; `FractalFlyByBudgetProbeTests.swift`; `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/fractal_fly_by/`; the FFB rows in the ARCHITECTURE module map + the golden/rubric test tables.

**Byte-contract regression found in passing.** `SceneUniformsTests` (size/stride == 240, D-187) had been **RED since FLY.12** — appending `presetSteer` grew the struct to 256 — and it merged to main because this session's gate runs never included that test. Removing the lane returns it to green. Lesson folded into the process note: the gate set for a GPU-contract change must include the layout tests.

**Kept dormant (agreed with Matt).** The MetalFX temporal-AA capability (MFX.1) and the RMPERF.1 per-hit preamble optimization are general ray-march engine work, no longer FFB-specific; they stay as reusable capabilities with no current consumer (like Phase RMENV, D-187). Their ARCHITECTURE provenance notes (which cite FFB as the motivating case) stay — they explain why the code exists.

**★ Durable process lesson.** Measure motion coherence *before* touching a single tuning constant. A preset that cannot move coherently must be killed in a day, not a fortnight of a reviewer's patience. The peripheral metrics that flatter the current build are the trap; the one that reproduces what the reviewer sees is the only one worth acting on.

## D-202: Beat-sync program ratified (SK.1, Matt GO 2026-07-26)

**Decision.** Elevate Uzume's beat-match and music-sync work into its own multi-phase program, spanning the five hard categories of material (baseline 4/4 strong pulse; odd meters; mid-song tempo changes; dense transients / polyrhythm; ambiguous / rubato). This realizes the D-145 "beat-sync elevated to its own project" direction. Matt's GO (2026-07-26) on the draft plan.

**The spec.** [`docs/BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md`](BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md) is the authoritative program spec — phases, per-category benchmark suites and targets, phase-by-phase increment specs, decision points, and the risk register. This entry ratifies it; the plan doc carries the detail and is not duplicated here.

**Four ratified inputs (Matt, 2026-07-26).**
1. **Ground truth = human taps + reference-tool cross-check.** Benchmark ground truth comes from Matt's tapped annotations reconciled against independent reference tools (madmom DBNBeatTracker + the vendored Beat This! PyTorch reference). Those tools run **offline as annotation tools only** — no madmom code and no CC-NC model weights ship in the product.
2. **The rolling live grid (RLG) is research-gated.** No engine code for the streaming rolling grid until the RLG.0 offline reproducibility study clears a pre-agreed numeric GO bar (DECISION D-C). Guard against filing cold-start dead-end iteration #7 — RLG is steady-state full-length-window tracking, explicitly *not* the FA #69 short-window family.
3. **Local-file and streaming paths proceed in parallel.** FT (full-track local-file analysis) is the proving ground and lands categories 2 and 3 for local files even if RLG returns NO-GO on streaming.
4. **Skills-first.** SK.1 authors the program's four new skills (`beat-sync-session`, `beatbench`, `reference-port`, `session-forensics`) + three edits (`closeout`, `defect-handling`, `session-prompt-author`) before any measurement or engine work — the skills are what keep ~24–34 sessions from re-deriving or violating the constraint set.

**Phases stubbed** in ENGINEERING_PLAN.md: GT (ground truth + benchmark harness), DBN (sequence decoding), FT (full-track local files), RLG (rolling live grid, research-gated), TRK (live tracker tightening), CNF (confidence + graded degradation), MDL (model headroom, optional). Each phase's first session expands its own spec from plan §4.

**Standing constraints, unchanged and not re-litigated by this program:** D-004 continuous-energy-primary hierarchy (this program improves an accent-layer signal, does not promote beats); the Cold-Start Phase Contract + FA #69 (no automated short-window cold-start phase derivation); FA #68 (sub-bass onsets are events, not a beat-phase reference); D-075 (never fuse onset bands for IOI timestamps).

**Downstream product decisions** arrive per phase (plan §5): D-B (finalize per-suite targets, after GT.3 baseline), D-C (RLG GO/NO-GO + the bar, after RLG.0), D-F (grid_bpm semantics under piecewise grids, DBN.4), D-D (FeatureVector budget route for confidence floats, CNF.1), D-E (adopt Beat This! final0, MDL.1).

**References.** D-145 (beat-sync elevated to its own project), D-004 (continuous energy primary; canonical in DECISIONS_HISTORY.md + CLAUDE.md §Audio Data Hierarchy), FA #68 / FA #69 (HISTORICAL_DEAD_ENDS.md §Cold-start beat-phase derivation + BEAT_SYNC.md), D-075 / D-079 / BUG-009 (tempo/octave rules), D-153 → D-158 (beat-locked motion on the cached grid is valid), the four SK.1 skills (`.claude/skills/`).

## D-203: Faraday — a Swift–Hohenberg sea wired into the engine (FDY.1, 2026-07-27)

**Decision.** Add Faraday: an iridescent liquid sea whose pattern is produced by a real
pattern-forming PDE driven by the music. Roster 26 → 27, `certified:false` pending Matt's live M7.

**Why this concept.** Matt's brief: a preset that behaves like another member of the band, making
the most of Apple Silicon — and *psychedelic, not black*. The concepts that die here are the ones
where a look is chosen first and music is bolted on after; the ones that land (Cymatic Resonance,
Mitosis) are the ones where **sound causes the image**. Faraday is the liquid sibling of the
Chladni plate: the same physical premise, continuous rather than granular, and it can break.

**The physics** (ported, FA #73 — Swift & Hohenberg 1977; Chen & Viñals 1997 for Faraday):

    du/dt = r*u - (lap + k0^2)^2 u + g*u^2 - u^3

- `r` — drive above threshold. **The Faraday threshold is a real supercritical bifurcation**, so a
  drop genuinely switches the sea on rather than fading it in. Calibrated against REAL band ranges
  (bass p50 ≈ 0.27 / p95 ≈ 0.67), not an assumed 0–1 (FA #31 / the CR.1.1 lesson).
- `k0` — selected wavenumber; timbre sets cell size. Smoothed hard, because a lattice needs TIME at
  a fixed wavelength to anneal — re-selecting it every frame leaves a defect-ridden mush.
- Plate modes gate the drive, so cells organise into large-scale figures, not wallpaper.

**Numerics — each caught by measuring, not by guessing.** The 3×3 Laplacian eigenvalue SATURATES at
−1.6 (it is only ≈ −0.3k² for small k), so growth is far slower than a naive −k² reading suggests —
early frames read as "grain" because the pattern was still growing. `dt` is bounded by the stiffest
term, the cubic (dt·3u² < 2); too large and the grid-scale checkerboard wins, which is instability,
not physics. **Volume conservation is REQUIRED**: the quadratic term pumps the spatially uniform
k=0 mode, essentially undamped at small k0, and left alone it wins — the field collapses to a flat
elevated state (measured: amplitude 0.32 → 0.004). A real dish cannot change its mean level.

**Colour is optics, not a palette.** Thin-film interference: the standing wave IS the film
thickness, so hues ripple and swap as the pattern moves.

**Engine work.** New per-frame hook `setRayMarchPreRenderCompute`. Ferrofluid Ocean — the only other
slot-10 consumer — BAKES its height field once at preset apply, so no per-frame path existed; a live
PDE must step on the render's own command buffer so the frame renders the field that frame produced.
State lives on `RayMarchPipeline` (stored properties cannot live in an extension, and
`RenderPipeline`'s body sits at the 300-line `type_body_length` ceiling).

**Two traps deliberately not repeated.** (1) **No SceneUniforms lanes were added** — time and phase
derive from `accumulatedAudioTime`, leaving the 240-byte D-187 contract untouched; FLY.12 grew the
struct to 256 and shipped a red byte-contract test. (2) **`SessionReplayHarness` steps simulated
slot-10 fields.** Without it the harness renders the zero placeholder and the surface is FLAT — the
FLY.6 divergence, where look conclusions come from an image production never produces. The first
production render did exactly this, and was caught because the harness was checked against
production rather than trusted.

**Known rough edges at land (honest).** Cell walls ring where interference packs too many fringes
into a few pixels — `sceneMaterial` receives no slope information (it has no access to texture(10)),
so the band-limit has only view distance to work with. The backdrop is a flat dark strip because the
engine offers only `env` (a grey studio) or `dark`; neither is a psychedelic sky, so the camera is
framed to fill the frame with sea. Both are M7-gated, not shipped as resolved.

240-byte contract), D-201 (Fractal Fly-By retirement — the motion-coherence lesson that shaped the
measurement discipline here), MFX.1 / RMPERF.1 (the capabilities this preset is built to exercise),

## D-204: Faraday retired — correct coupling, low-energy image (FDYRETIRE.1, 2026-07-27)

**Decision.** Retire Faraday after three live M7s. Matt's call.

**What makes this different from the other retirements.** Kinetic Sculpture, Truchet Loom and
Kleinian Froth died on a reference-vs-mechanism miss. Fractal Fly-By died on a proven physical
ceiling (motion incoherence). Faraday died with **everything measurably working**:

| Round | What was wrong | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | no beat route at all; threshold never fired | per-frame drive change median 0.0000; 99 % of frames above threshold |
| 2 | geometry moved, image did not | geometry vs subharmonic r = +0.69, but screen delta 1.11/255, luminance swing 7 % |
| 3 | mechanisms all correct | beat legibility r = +0.748 (decoy −0.659), structure swing 5.2×, motion 4.89/255 @ ratio 2.04 |

Round 3 shipped a genuinely beat-locked, threshold-crossing, coherent preset — and it still read
as cheap and unsynced. **A correct mapping cannot rescue an intrinsically low-energy image.** A
top-down dish of slowly-breathing cells has a low ceiling on visual energy no matter how
faithfully the music drives it; that is a concept property, not a tuning parameter.

**Process note worth keeping.** Two of the three rounds were spent measuring the wrong thing.
Round 1's fix was verified against the *mechanism* (does the field track the grid?) rather than
the *image* (does the screen move?), and the mechanism metric was green while the picture was
static. Gate on rendered frames — see the durable rule in
`feedback_motion_coherence_before_tuning`.

**Removed.** `Faraday.metal` + sidecar; `FaradaySimulation.swift`; `FaradaySim.metal`; app
wiring; and `setRayMarchPreRenderCompute` — the per-frame compute hook whose only consumer this
was. Per D-097 that hook is deleted rather than kept as reusable infrastructure; it is small and
recoverable from git if a future simulated-field preset needs it.

**Kept.** Everything from HARNESS.1: `stems.csv` loaded per frame, pulse fields mapped, and
`ReplayHarnessRouteCoverageTests`. Those are not Faraday work — they are repairs to a
measurement instrument that had been silently feeding zeros to every replayable preset, and they
outlive the preset that exposed them.

**References.** D-203 (Faraday's addition), D-201 (Fractal Fly-By retirement — a ceiling proven
by instrument), D-097 (siblings not subclasses — no dead-concept code kept as infrastructure),

## D-205: D-B ratified — BeatBench per-suite targets (GT.3, Matt 2026-07-30)

**Decision.** Set the BeatBench per-suite targets against the measured GT.3 baseline, resolving decision D-B (BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md §5). Two product calls from Matt shaped them.

**Product call 1 — a valid metrical level is a success.** When the grid pulses at half or double the rate a listener would tap, that counts as tracked. Rationale in Matt's terms: visuals pulsing on every other beat still read as locked to the music; what breaks the feel is a grid sitting on *no* real pulse. Consequence: suites 2 and 4 gate on **AMLt** (which accepts double/half/offbeat readings) rather than strict F-measure. Money (F 0.58 → AMLt 0.88) and Bleed (F 0.61 → AMLt 0.84) are therefore passes; their grids are clean 2:1 readings of the tapped pulse.

**Product call 2 — meter/downbeats are a hard gate.** Not report-only. The justification is that shipped, certified presets already consume bar position — Nacre's downbeat camera push and Glaze's downbeat push are each that preset's *connection layer* (D-171, D-173) — so a wrong bar-1 directly degrades visuals users see.

**Ratified targets.**

| suite | target | baseline | state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — baseline 4/4 | F ≥ 0.95 offline (unchanged); live p90 < 30 ms | 0.97 | offline MET |
| 2 — odd meters | **AMLt ≥ 0.85**; meter correct ≥ 3/4 | AMLt 1.00 / 1.00 / 0.88 / 0.75 / 0.21; meter 0/5 | beats mostly met, meter is the work |
| 3 — tempo changes | **DEFERRED** | F 0.47 (1 track) | not measurable offline |
| 4 — dense transients | **AMLt ≥ 0.80** + **stability ≥ 8/9 windows within 5 %, spread < 1.1×** | AMLt 0.84; stability 6/9, 2.11× | beats met, stability is the work |
| 5 — rubato | **DEFERRED** to Phase CNF | barConfidence 0.55 on Clair de Lune | confidence not yet trustworthy |

**Suite 2 is 0.85, not the 0.90 first proposed.** The initial proposal argued 0.90 "costs nothing since the clean tracks already exceed it". That was wrong once AMLt gating was chosen: 0.90 fails Money at 0.88 — by 0.02 — despite a musically valid 2:1 grid, while 0.85 correctly passes the three defensible readings and fails the two that genuinely are not (Pyramid Song 0.75, YYZ 0.21). The bar should discriminate on musical validity, not on a round number.

**What the baseline actually revealed.** Tempo is in better shape than the plan assumed: on the two suite-2 tracks with unambiguous ground truth the grid scores **0.99 and 0.97 with CMLt 1.00** — above the original 0.85 odd-meter bar. Meanwhile `beatsPerBar` is plausible on **2 of 9** tracks (Take Five reads 2 and is 5; Solsbury Hill and Money read 1 and are 7), and downbeat F is 0.13–0.26 everywhere except Billie Jean's 0.90. The program's §1 targets led with beat F — the axis that was mostly already working.

**Confidence is not yet a usable signal (why suite 5 defers).** Sorted by `barConfidence`: Bohemian Rhapsody 0.29 (wrong), YYZ 0.37 (wrong), Bleed 0.50 (right), **Clair de Lune 0.55 (wrong — and should read near zero)**, Pyramid Song 0.58 (right), through Billie Jean 1.00 (right). The two worst tracks do rank lowest, but true rubato outranks a correct grid. Suite 5's premise is a trustworthy confidence signal; that is Phase CNF's job, and gating it now would gate on a broken instrument.

**Coverage caveat, recorded deliberately.** These targets rest on 9 of 17 ground-truthed tracks, and suites 1, 3, 4 and 5 have exactly one track each. Suite-1's 0.97 and suite-4's numbers are anecdotes until more tracks are tapped. The targets are ratified as *direction*, and should be re-checked once coverage grows — not treated as statistically settled.

**Live-path targets are untouched and unmeasured.** Every live target (phase error p90, re-lock latency, lock %, confident-wrong rate) still has no baseline; session-replay mode is unbuilt. BUG-065's drift reaching 119 ms late-track (TRK evidence) means suite 1's live p90 < 30 ms is the hardest open target in the program.

## D-206: Phase TRK parked; DBN is the next beat-sync lever (TRK.2, Matt 2026-07-30)

**Decision.** Park phase TRK. BUG-065 stays open and bounded, `UZUME_BEAT_PLL` stays
default-off, and the next beat-sync session opens phase **DBN** (bar-pointer-model decoding over
Beat This! activations). Matt's call, 2026-07-30: "park the tracker, go DBN next session."

**Why the tracker ran out of road.** Two independent levers were measured against the same frozen
single-BPM grid, and neither closes the defect:

| Lever | Result |
|---|---|
| TRK.1 — controller topology (proportional EMA → type-2 PI) | Root cause proven: drift is a ramp, −1.493 ms/s at R² 0.844 ⇒ a 0.149 % cached-grid period error. The PI fix **regressed the real fixture** — maxAbsDrift 101.5 ms (limit 50), alignment 0.05 (limit 0.80). Strike 1 on gain tuning. |
| TRK.2 — evidence source (sub-bass → drums stem) | **Falsified by measurement.** Onsets within ±50 ms of a grid beat, drums-stem sub_bass vs full-mix sub_bass: love_rehab 16.9 % vs 42.2 %, Hummer 11.0 % vs 14.4 %, `bleed.wav` 22.4 % vs 22.3 %, billie_jean 25.5 % vs 24.5 %. Worse on two, a wash on two — including Bleed, the category-4 track the argument rested on. |

**The generalised finding, which is what actually decides this.** Across every capture, every band
and both signal paths, **only ~15–25 % of detected onsets land within ±50 ms of a beat**. FA #68
is not a property of the sub-bass band — it is a property of the **spectral-onset detector
family**. Isolating drums removes bassline notes but adds hats, ghost notes and 16ths: it changes
*which* non-beat events fire, not how many. So any tracker whose evidence is an onset flag
inherits a ~75–85 % off-beat rate whatever its controller topology. **The evidence layer has no
headroom left; further tracker work is tuning against a signal that cannot support it.**

**What this changes in the program.** Two claims in `BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md` are now corrected
by measurement rather than argument: (1) the category-4 leverage entry "TRK.2" is withdrawn —
Bleed's palm-muted 16ths do saturate sub-bass flux, but the drums stem does **not** carry a
cleaner pulse, so category 4 rests on DBN and MDL; (2) TRK.3 (BUG-065 closure gate) has no
content and is blocked. Phases GT, DBN, FT, RLG, CNF, MDL are unaffected.

**Also recorded — a constraint on any future stem-timing idea.** `runPerFrameStemAnalysis`
deliberately carries 5–10 s of latency with a ~5 s sawtooth re-anchor. Stem features are fine for
energy and deviation; they cannot carry a *timestamp* without threading each onset's true tap time
through the analyzer, which is a distinct design from anything TRK.2 described.

**Kept.** `DrumsOnsetEvidenceTests` — the env-gated instrument that produced the table above. It
answers "is this signal beat evidence?" for any audio, grid and band, and is the natural
regression check when DBN changes what the grid is.

## D-207: Decoder declines when the bar is unclear; meter set fixed at {3,4,5,7} (DBN.1, Matt 2026-07-30)

**Decision.** Two product calls on the bar-pointer decoder specified at DBN.1. Matt, 2026-07-30:
"decline when unsure, keep {3,4,5,7}."

**Call 1 — when the decoder cannot tell what the bar is, the visuals decline rather than guess.**
Bar position drives Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat camera pushes (D-171, D-173) — each preset's
connection layer. The GT.3 baseline has `beatsPerBar` wrong on 7 of 9 measured tracks, so a wrong
bar-1 is *already* firing an accent on an arbitrary beat, invisibly. The alternative to declining
is keeping that. Matt's call takes the plainer reading over the wrong one, consistent with D-205's
product call that meter is a hard gate because a wrong bar-1 degrades visuals users see, and with
the program's category-5 position that "success = declining honestly".

**Call 2 — `dbnMeterHypotheses` = {3, 4, 5, 7}, fixed.** Covers every meter in the ground-truth
catalogue (4, 5, 7) plus waltz. {6, 9, 12} stay out: each is ambiguous with {3, 4} at a different
metrical level, so admitting them buys compound-meter labelling at the risk of a 4/4 track
confidently relabelled 12/8 — and each hypothesis multiplies decode cost. Widening the set is now a
product decision, not an implementation one.

**What call 1 changes about the decoder — it is not a threshold bolted on at the end.**

- The output is no longer "a meter" but "a meter **or** no confident bar". `beatsPerBar` alone
  cannot express the result; the output contract gains a bar-confidence flag consumers gate on.
- The meter-margin confidence (spec §6.1 — the log-likelihood gap between the best and runner-up
  meter hypotheses) becomes **load-bearing rather than diagnostic**. That margin is a genuinely
  better-posed quantity than today's `barConfidence`, which D-205 recorded as untrustworthy
  (Clair de Lune reads 0.55 and should read near zero).
- DBN.2 ships the decline path and its threshold, set from the margin's measured distribution
  across the 9 ground-truthed tracks — from data, not taste.
- DBN.3's A/B gains a metric: **decline rate per track**. A decoder that declines on everything is
  not a win, and meter-correct-count alone would not catch it.

**Explicitly not chosen: per-preset fallback gestures.** A third option — let presets substitute a
bar-free gesture (e.g. an every-4-beats push) when the decoder declines — was rejected for now.
Presets that lose the bar accent keep beat-level motion and nothing replaces it. If odd-meter
material then reads too plain, the graded version belongs to **CNF.2**, which already owns the
D-154 binary-gate → graded-scaling evolution. Do not implement preset fallbacks inside phase DBN.

**Scope guard.** The decoder's confidence may be *reported* at DBN.3 and *gated on* for the
decline decision only. It does not become the general beat-confidence signal — that is CNF.1's
fusion job, and D-205 deferred suite 5 to CNF precisely because gating on a broken instrument
gates on nothing.

## D-208: D-E resolved — final0 not adopted; the evidence ceiling is not capacity (MDL.1, Matt 2026-07-31)

**Decision.** Do not adopt the Beat This! `final0` checkpoint. small0 remains the shipped grid
model. Matt, 2026-07-31: "don't adopt final0." Resolves decision **D-E**
(BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN.md §5), whose standing recommendation was "data-dependent".

**The data.** MDL.1 converted final0 (161 tensors, 20,253,104 params / 81 MB) and ran it through
the **real MPSGraph path** — not the PyTorch reference, because D-E asks about prep latency and
only the shipping path can measure that. Across the 9 ground-truthed tracks:

| | weights | meter correct | mean downbeat:beat ratio | mean inference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| small0 | 8.4 MB | **2 / 6** | 0.494 | 131 ms |
| final0 | 81 MB | **2 / 6** | 0.475 | 200 ms |

No meter improvement — final0 gains bohemian_rhapsody and loses bleed, a trade. The degeneracy
metric moves 4 % and not even consistently (money 0.90 → 0.59 improves; solsbury_hill 0.69 → 0.87
and take_five 0.41 → 0.58 worsen). And **`bleed` — the suite-4 case the plan expected final0 to
fix — regresses**, its BPM doubling 115.00 → 259.43 and its meter going 4 ✓ → 2 ✗. Cost: ~10× the
weights, ~1.3× steady-state inference. Full table: `docs/diagnostics/MDL1_FINAL0_AB_2026-07-31.md`.

**The corollary is the load-bearing part.** DBN.2 established that, with the observation-model
bias removed, the remaining gap is **evidence quality, not model bias**. MDL.1 tested whether
capacity supplies that evidence. It does not. Together with TRK.2 — where drums-stem onsets were
falsified as a source — the program has now established the same finding three independent ways:

| increment | lever tried | result |
|---|---|---|
| TRK.2 (D-206) | different onset source | onsets cannot supply beat evidence at all (~15–25 % within ±50 ms, any band or stem) |
| DBN.2 | read the existing evidence without bias | odd meters won by hairline margins; margin cannot separate right from wrong |
| **MDL.1 (this)** | **a 10× larger model of the same family** | **no cleaner downbeat stream** |

**Consequence for the program — AMENDED 2026-07-31, see below.** Phase TRK is already parked
(D-206). Phase DBN's next increment, DBN.3, was to wire the decoder in and A/B it — but the
decoder gets odd meters wrong and its confidence signal does not separate, so that A/B would
measure the known deficiency rather than the decoder. **Do not open DBN.3 as specified** until
FT.1 has run.

**AMENDMENT (2026-07-31, same day).** As first written this entry said categories 2 and 4 "need a
changed premise, not another attempt at these levers", and listed a different model family /
training target / bar-position source as the open candidates. **That was overstated, and Matt
correctly pushed back that it was an engineering judgement dressed up as a product decision.**
One large confound is still in play and was not controlled for: **the 30-second window**.

`BeatThisModel.tMax = 1500` means every measurement behind this decision — TRK.2's, DBN.2's and
MDL.1's — came from ~30 s of audio. money's meter was decided from **51 beats of a 380-second
track**. Meter is a *periodicity* question, and periodicity estimated from 51 beats of a
degenerate downbeat stream is a materially weaker problem than the same question over ~700 beats.

**FT.1 lifts that clamp, so it is the cheapest test of whether the evidence is genuinely thin or
merely short.** If odd meters remain broken with full-track context, the premise really is
exhausted and the model-family question becomes real. If they improve, DBN.3 comes back to life
unchanged. **No model-family question should be opened before FT.1 reports.** The measured
findings above stand exactly as recorded; only the inference drawn from them is narrowed.

**AMENDMENT RESOLVED (2026-07-31, FT.1 ran the same day) — the confound is controlled for and
D-208's original conclusion STANDS.** Full-track tiled activations (13–25 windows per track,
13k–22k frames vs 1500) improved **nothing**:

| track | truth | 30 s resolver / decoder | full-track resolver / decoder |
|---|---|---|---|
| billie_jean | 4 | 4 ✓ / 4 ✓ | 4 ✓ / 4 ✓ |
| money | 7 | 1 ✗ / declined | 2 ✗ / 4 ✗ |
| solsbury_hill | 7 | 1 ✗ / declined | 1 ✗ / declined |
| take_five | 5 | 2 ✗ / 4 ✗ | 2 ✗ / declined |
| bohemian_rhapsody | 4 | 2 ✗ / **4 ✓** | 3 ✗ / declined |
| bleed | 4 | 4 ✓ / 4 ✓ | 2 ✗ / 4 ✓ |

**Improved: none. Regressed: bohemian_rhapsody.** Giving the model 13–25× more context does not
recover a single odd meter, so **the 30 s window was not the confound and the evidence really is
thin**. The amendment was the right call procedurally — the confound was untested and testing it
was cheap — but its implied hope was wrong, and the original inference is now *better* supported
than when first written. **The model-family question is open.**

*Unproven observation worth recording, not acted on:* the full-track resolver's meter moves around
a lot and `bleed` regresses on it. Averaging overlapping windows is a low-pass on the activation
timeline, and a downbeat stream whose problem is already weak discrimination may be made worse by
smoothing. A tapered (centre-weighted) overlap is the obvious alternative to plain averaging. Not
attempted — the two-strikes rule applies, and this would be a third observation-model-shaped
iteration inside one line of work.

**Code retention — a deliberate keep, with a deletion trigger.** D-097 says deleted-concept code
does not earn preservation as "reusable infrastructure", so the keep is stated rather than
assumed. Retained: `BeatThisModel.Variant`, the external `weightsDirectory` seam, and
`Final0ABTests` — together the *reproduction* of a committed measurement, ~40 lines, env-gated,
and verified behaviour-preserving for small0 (all 26 `BeatThis*` tests pass, including the
layer-match suite that caught four bugs at DSP.2 S8). MDL is listed in the plan as optional
headroom revisitable at any time, and the A/B doc names a prerequisite (build a final0
layer-match fixture) for anyone revisiting it. **Delete all three if MDL is retired outright, or
if they are still consumer-less at the next pruning pass** — that is the trigger, and absent it
this becomes exactly the unexplained cruft D-097 targets.

**Not verified, recorded rather than buried.** There is no final0 layer-match fixture, so that
port is unverified — the negative result would only be wrong if a port bug were *masking* an
improvement. Anyone revisiting D-E must build the fixture before adopting on this evidence.

## D-209: Witchlight — concept, D-121 divergence axis, and flash budget (WL.1, Matt 2026-07-31)

**Decision.** Witchlight ships as an MD.6 Milkdrop-inspired uplift, split into WL.1 (references + design, this decision) and WL.2 (authoring). Its inspiration source is `martin - witchcraft reloaded`. Under D-121 it **diverges from the source on the dominant motion model, and consequentially on palette character.**

Operative form — the paragraph WL.2's M7 side-by-side is judged against:

> The pen tip's path is a function of the track's harmonic and spectral motion, so chord changes turn the stroke and the figure hanging in the dark is a drawing of the last thirty seconds of the song. Same register as the source — same beaded luminous line, same dark sky, same violet bloom, same flare at the head — but the motion means something. Colour follows: each bead's hue records where the harmony was when it was laid down, so the ribbon reads as the track's colour history rather than an arbitrary rainbow.

**Why this axis and not the alternatives** (Matt's rationale, carried forward verbatim in substance). Two others were on the table — replacing the violet-nebula sky and random per-segment colour with a Uzume palette (lightest touch, satisfies D-121 on the palette axis alone), or changing the composition so the figure is drawn large and close on the picture plane instead of tumbling small in deep space (boldest visual departure). **Both leave the stroke saying nothing about the music, so the musical-role sentence stays weak under either.** The motion-model axis is the only one that also fixes the source's actual weakness; it gives a clean answer to the musical-role gate — the hardest gate for this concept and the one that killed Drift Motes (D-102) and Glass Brutalist (D-186); and its divergence is trivially demonstrable side by side: **the source's figure is the same species of scribble on any track and a different scribble on a repeat play; Witchlight's is different on every track and the same on a repeat play.**

**The axis is founded on measurement, and the gate was real.** WL.1 task 3 was a hard stop: if the harmonic drivers did not measure alive on real music, the axis was unfounded and the increment re-scoped to the palette-and-sky fallback rather than designing against a dead signal. `tonal_phase_fifths` measured alive on all four captures (full ±π range on each), so the fallback was not triggered. The measured table is `docs/presets/WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN.md` §2.

**Three measurement findings that outlive Witchlight** and belong to the engine, not the preset:

1. **`pulse_amp01` is a silence gate, not a driver — and it is working correctly.** It sits at 1.000 from p5 to max across all four captures and is below 0.999 on only 1.3 % of the 318 383 live frames. `RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` §7 documents it as gating silence (0 before the first note, 0 across > 0.5 s of sustained silence), which is precisely the measured behaviour, so this is **not** a defect. The correction is to how it gets cited: an always-on gate has no dynamic range, so any preset or design naming it as a *driver* is naming a constant. `pulse_phase01` is the steady-pulse driver, and it measures a full 0–1 sawtooth.
2. **`harmonic_flux`, `tonal_tension` and `section_index` are alive on the live capture but near-flat on 2 of 3 offline route-coverage fixtures.** `harmonic_flux` is essentially always nonzero live (p50 0.058) and 0.2 % nonzero on `love_rehab`. This is the QG.1.1 offline/live gap surfacing on a new family of primitives, and it has a direct design consequence: Witchlight cannot use a flux primitive as a chord-change detector and instead reads the turn out of the smoothed phase's own motion. Whether the gap is a fixture-generation artifact or a real capability gap is **open** and WL.2 must not paper over it.
3. **`spectral_centroid` reads ≈ 0.04–0.21 on real music, not 0–1** — third independent sighting after BUG-027 and CR.1.1 / D-197. A `centroid × N` mapping moves less than one step across a whole track.

Plus the design-shaping one: **the smoothed harmonic phase's angular rate varies ~10× across tracks** (0.91 vs 11.4 rad/s p95 at τ = 1.5 s). Ungoverned, the identical code draws reference `01` (a legible written figure) on one track and anti-reference `10` (an unreadable tangle) on the next. The design's answer is a **bounded-curvature advance** — fixed governed speed, clamped turn rate, minimum turning radius ≥ 8 % of frame height — so the harmony controls curvature only and curvature cannot exceed the legibility bound. This is a mechanism, not a tuning constant, and it is the reason `WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN.md` §3.1 names it explicitly.

**Flash budget, decided up front rather than tuned down later.** The source's head flare saturates most of the frame to white on mid-band hits and re-fires on every hit — visible in roughly a fifth of the sampled frames of Matt's render, committed as anti-reference `12`. It is a fidelity failure (the subject disappears) before it is a safety one. Witchlight's budget, every value a WL.2 requirement measured and reported in its closeout:

| Budget | Value |
|---|---|
| Peak full-frame mean relative luminance | ≤ 0.35 |
| Max full-frame mean luminance Δ per frame | ≤ 0.06 (below the 0.10 WCAG swing threshold — 0.00 flashes/s by construction, not by staying under 3) |
| Flare extent, ≥ 50 % of peak intensity | ≤ 3 % of frame area |
| Flare extent, ≥ 10 % of peak intensity | ≤ 12 % of frame area |
| Minimum re-fire interval | ≥ 900 ms, hard refractory (≈ 1.1 flares/s max; the source manages 4.5/s under the harness drive) |
| Rise / fall envelope | ≥ 60 ms rise, ≥ 200 ms fall |
| Target measured | **0.00 flashes/s** under `FlashHarnessSupport.worstCaseBeatTrain` (4.5 Hz, 60 fps, 3 s) |

The flare is additionally driven from `bass_dev` against the measured per-capture p95, never from an absolute threshold on an AGC-normalized band — the source's own fault on this route is FA #31 / D-026.

**Two level-3 grounding ratings accepted, not hidden** (`WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN.md` §6):

- *No empirical grounding for driving a light-painting stroke's geometry from harmonic state.* No published demo, paper or shipped preset does it. CR.1.2 demonstrates the primitive is usable for **hue**; using it for **geometry** is new.
- *No empirical grounding for the combination* of a harmonic-driven bounded-curvature path with age-weighted relaxation and a beaded 30-second trail. Structurally the Aurora Veil failure shape — a pairing no published demo used.

**The mitigation is a scheduling requirement on WL.2, not a hope.** WL.2's first deliverable, before any shading, palette or fidelity work, is a motion-gated look-spike on the §2 captures (`Scripts/motion_gate.sh`, D-195; the reader is the eyes per D-064). It answers exactly one question — *does the figure read as a drawing?* If it reads as a tangle on any capture, that is discovered in hours and the response is to re-scope, not to spend M7 rounds tuning the clamp. Fractal Fly-By (D-201, 14 rounds) and Truchet Loom (D-194) are the precedents this gate exists to prevent repeating.

**Carry-forward.**

- `docs/presets/WITCHLIGHT_DESIGN.md` §7.4 is the registration checklist WL.2 executes; every `NEW_PRESET_CHECKLIST.md` item is listed or marked not-applicable with a reason.
- No new render pass, fragment-buffer slot or `SceneUniforms` change is taken. If WL.2 needs one, that is a DECISION-NEEDED for Matt.
- WL.2's closeout carries the mandatory D-121 side-by-side and Matt's divergence rationale; a preset that cannot articulate the divergence does not certify, and the remediation is rewrite, not tune (D-121 / D-116).
- The `sectionIndex` `trail_contraction` route is flagged at-risk in advance: only `there_there` carries a section boundary offline. If it reds it is filed in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` as a route defect — the floor is never tuned (QG.1 / D-179).
- Finding 2 above (the offline/live gap on the harmonic + section primitives) is a standing question for the fixture-generation path, larger than this preset.

**Amendment 2026-07-31 (WL.2/WL.3 integration — §3.1's heading model falsified; circular-deviation steer adopted).**

Two WL.2 increments ran in parallel off the same WL.1 base, deliberately (Matt), and **reached the same conclusion independently by different routes.** That convergence is the strongest part of the evidence, so both routes are recorded rather than one being presented as the finding:

- **Branch A (`claude/witchlight-authoring`)** ran a falsification probe: §3.1's `θ̇ = k·φ̄̇` drew a near-straight line on all four §2 captures at every τ across a 10× sweep, and the diagnosis was that it integrates to `θ = k·φ̄ + c`, so the heading is bounded by a primitive measured to be strongly **concentrated** (circular R = 0.94–0.98 smoothed on `so_what`). An absolute read of a bounded circular primitive — FA #31 in shape.
- **Branch B (`claude/witchlight-preset-authoring-1a6d37`)** ran a three-model spike (`.turnRate` / `.curvature` / `.curvatureDeviation`) against the same fixtures and found only the deviation model produces a gesture, for the same stated reason: φ̄ has high travel but near-zero net, so its excursions carry the information and its absolute value carries almost none.

**Adopted:** `θ̇ = clamp(g · wrap(φ̄ − home), ±ω_max)`, where `home` is a long-τ circular mean of φ̄. Both branches had arrived at the identical equation; B's `.curvatureDeviation` and A's deviation form differ in name only.

**One substantive addition from the reconciliation.** B shipped a **fixed** gain and named `love_rehab` as an open question — its figure stayed an arc. A's probe used a **per-track normalised** gain and produced a legible closed loop on that same capture. The cause is measurable: circular R runs 0.24–0.78 across the §2 captures, so a fixed gain assumes an excursion magnitude that `love_rehab` (R = 0.241, tonal home genuinely ill-defined) does not have. Normalising the deviation against a running estimate of its own magnitude is the same construction that dissolved the ~10× cross-track rate spread in §2.3, and is what D-026 means by reading a driver relatively. `normaliseDeviationGain` is on by default; the fixed-gain path is retained behind the flag.

**Consequences.**

1. **Concept, divergence axis and musical-role sentence are unchanged.** Only how the primitive is read. Matt's D-121 sign-off stands.
2. **§6's level-3 rating on "harmonic state → pen-path geometry" discharges to level 2** — first-party measurement on four real captures, now from two independent implementations. **The level-3 on the COMBINATION also discharges:** branch A rendered the deviation steer through the production particle path as contiguous 40-second sequences on all four captures and gated them with `Scripts/motion_gate.sh` — smooth, legible, on-concept, no jitter/pop/strobe/freeze, and no capture produced the anti-reference tangle.
3. **A cautionary note on the metric, kept because it nearly misled the comparison.** B's `headingMonotonicity` (|net| / travel) reads *the wrong way* for this failure: a heading slamming between clamp rails reverses constantly with near-zero net displacement, scoring "0 = figure" for what is actually a straight line with wobble. Clamp fraction is what separates them, and the rendered path is the arbiter. **Neither scalar decides this alone.**
4. **Reusable beyond this preset:** a circular primitive needs a deviation treatment for the same reason a band energy does. Filed into `RENDER_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md` §7. CR.1.2 was not wrong to read `tonal_phase_fifths` absolutely — it drives *hue*, where concentration is harmless. Motion is the different case.
5. **Open, and NOT fixed here:** §3.4's colour model has the same concentration problem — bead hue is the absolute frozen phase, so on `so_what` (R = 0.976) the whole 30 s ribbon is one blue-violet while `love_rehab` shows real banding. Same structural error, same section. It is a design change and Matt's call.

**Evidence.** `docs/diagnostics/WL2A_PEN_KINEMATICS_2026-07-31.md` (falsification + motion verdict), `docs/diagnostics/WL2A_HEADING_AB_2026-07-31.md` (head-to-head, both branches' constants and metrics); reproduce with `tools/wl2_pen_probe.py` and `tools/wl2_heading_ab.py`.

## D-210: Wrong metrical level — decline the bar, keep the beat (FT.3.1, Matt 2026-07-31)

**Decision.** When Uzume's beat grid is running at double or half the pulse a listener would
tap, presets receive **no bar position** and fall back to their energy-driven behaviour. The beat
layer is untouched — the pulse still feels locked. Matt, 2026-07-31: "decline the bar, keep the
beat."

**What forced the question.** D-205 made two product calls that FT.3 has now measured as being in
tension. It gates beat *feel* on AMLt rather than strict F, on the explicit grounds that a grid at
half or double the tapped pulse "still reads as locked" and only a grid on no real pulse breaks the
feel. It simultaneously makes meter/downbeat a **hard** gate, because Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat
camera pushes (D-171, D-173) are those presets' connection layer and a wrong bar-1 degrades shipped
visuals.

Both are right on their own terms. They cannot both be satisfied on the same track:

| track | grid BPM | truth BPM | CMLt | AMLt | gap | FT.3 bar-line phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| billie_jean | 116.88 | 117.44 | 0.97 | 0.97 | 0.00 | 100 % ✓ |
| take_five | 169.24 | 167.07 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 85 % ✓ |
| solsbury_hill | 102.68 | 102.44 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 14 % (ground truth suspect) |
| **money** | **116.19** | **60.97** | **0.00** | **0.88** | **0.88** | **0 %** |
| **bleed** | **115.00** | **226.72** | **0.03** | **0.84** | **0.81** | **16 %** |

The two tracks with a large AMLt−CMLt gap are **exactly** the two where the bar-line phase failed
with the meter correct; every zero-gap track got the phase right. A grid at the wrong metrical
level feels locked *and* makes the bar line unrecoverable, because a global beat index no longer
names the bar.

**Why declining rather than correcting.** Look at what the two failures would need:

- **money** grid 116.19 BPM wants **halving** to ~58.
- **bleed** grid 115.00 BPM wants **doubling** to ~230.

Same tempo, opposite corrections. **No global BPM threshold can separate them**, and lowering
`BeatGrid.halvingThresholdBPM` (175, halving-only since QR.1) re-opens BUG-009 — fast rock at
158–174 halved to a half-rate visual pulse. Any correction must come from audio content, blind, and
its confident-wrong rate is unmeasured. Declining cannot be worse than today, where the accent
already fires on an arbitrary beat; a wrong correction fires it on an arbitrary beat *confidently*,
for the whole track.

**Consequences.**

- Extends D-207's output contract — "a meter **or** no confident bar" — with a **second decline
  reason**: not "the meter is unclear" but "the meter may be right and the bar line is still not
  locatable". Consumers gate on the same bar-confidence flag; no new surface.
- On an affected track, Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat pushes simply do not fire. Those presets keep
  beat-level motion and nothing replaces it — the same position D-207 took, and for the same
  reason. A graded fallback remains CNF.2's territory (D-154 evolution), not this decision's.
- **Correction is not ruled out permanently.** It returns as a live option if FT.3.1 task 5's
  confusion matrix shows a near-zero confident-wrong rate on the synthetic wrong-level set. Until
  then it is a hypothesis, not a plan.
- FT.3.1's detector is what makes this decision actionable — without a blind wrong-level signal
  there is nothing to gate on. This decision sets that increment's target, not the reverse: a
  detector that declines correctly is a win even if it never corrects anything.

**Explicitly not decided here.** Whether the level is detectable blind at all. FT.3.1 task 3 has a
hard stop for the case where nothing separates the synthetic 2× and ½× cases; if that is the
result, this decision still stands and simply has no trigger, which is the status quo stated
honestly rather than a regression.

## D-211: Reference/diagnostic images leave git; the LFS purge is a separate, explicit step (LFS.2, Matt 2026-07-31)

**Decision.** Raster images under `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/` and `docs/diagnostics/` are gitignored **and untracked**. They stay on developer disks; no build target reads them. Text records in those directories — READMEs, diagnoses, rendering contracts, `source_*.txt/json` — **stay in git**.

**Why this supersedes the earlier attempt.** A prior branch (`claude/lfs-charges-gitignore-ecd130`) intended the same outcome and achieved the opposite. It added the `.gitignore` rules and removed the LFS filter, but never ran `git rm --cached`. **`.gitignore` has no effect on already-tracked paths**, so the files stayed tracked — and without the LFS filter they were re-committed as full blobs. Measured, on that branch:

| | Image bytes in the git object database |
|---|---|
| `main` (LFS pointers) | 25.7 KB |
| that branch (real blobs) | **100.6 MB** |

Zero files left the index. Merging it would have written ~100 MB permanently into history — removable only by a filter-repo rewrite — while the LFS objects, and the storage bill, remained. The lesson generalises: **for a "stop tracking this" change, the load-bearing step is `git rm --cached`; the `.gitignore` edit only governs what happens next.** Verify by counting what actually left the index, not by reading the ignore file.

**What this does and does not accomplish.** Untracking stops **new** LFS objects. It does **not** reclaim the existing ones: GitHub does not garbage-collect unreferenced LFS objects, so storage keeps billing until the history is rewritten *and* a Support request purges the orphans. `Scripts/reclaim-lfs-visual-refs.sh` performs the rewrite against a fresh mirror clone (dry-run by default, `--execute` to push) and documents the Support step. **Neither is run here** — a history rewrite is its own decision with its own blast radius, and it is Matt's call when to take it.

**Worktree consequence, handled rather than discovered later.** Gitignored files do not propagate to new worktrees or fresh clones, and the preset-session workflow is *read the README and look at the images*. A worktree without them does not fail — it silently degrades preset work, which is worse. `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` now symlinks the reference and diagnostic images alongside the test fixtures it already handled (filtered to rasters, so OS junk is not linked). This is the same trap the gitignored tempo fixtures already sprang, and the same fix.

**Carry-forward.**

- The weights half of the superseded branch was sound and landed separately as the preceding commit (PUB.2 — ML weights ship as the `ml-weights-v1` Release asset). The two were entangled in one branch; they are independent changes and are now independent commits.
- The superseded branch also carried a **D-195 that collides with main's D-195** (motion review gate). It is not merged and should not be; this decision takes D-211.
- Any new preset's reference set is now local-only from the moment it is curated. `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/README.md` remains in git and remains the authority on what the images show.

## D-214: Meniscus CERTIFIED — the sync came from the audio hierarchy, not from timing accuracy (MEN.5, Matt 2026-08-05)

Matt's M7: *"Ready to certify. Looks good!!!"*

**The headline finding, and it cost eleven live rounds to reach: drop timing was never the
problem.** By MEN.3c the visible ripple peak landed a median **6 ms** from the beat, and
ground truth confirmed the grid itself at **+4 / +8 / +8 / +8 ms** across a whole track
(Beat This! vs `2026-08-05T22-27-38Z`). Matt's verdict stayed "not synced" through all of
it. Ten rounds of ±millisecond work moved a number that was already correct.

**Three causes, each measured, none visible to the gates that existed at the time.**

1. **The live stem path lags ~5.2 s.** Cross-correlated on `2026-08-05T13-17-18Z`: drums
   +5.25 s (r=0.550), bass +5.25, vocals +5.08, other +5.25, against r=0.363 at lag 0.
   `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift` documents this as intended — stem features answer *what
   kind of passage is this*, a section-scale question. MEN.3 routed per-stem **events**
   through them, so ~40 % of drops fired five seconds late and every drop's force described
   music that had already gone. **Offline fixtures hid it completely** by feeding stems in
   sync with the audio; the latency exists only on the live path.
2. **The surface had no continuous audio-driven motion during music.** The swell — its only
   continuous element — was gated off as volume rose, leaving 100 % discrete drop events.
   That inverts CLAUDE.md's central rule (*continuous energy is the DEFAULT PRIMARY
   DRIVER*), and Matt's "feels less tethered to the music" is precisely that rule's
   predicted failure. **Cutting drop density made it worse**, which is what ruled density
   out and forced the right diagnosis.
3. **The beat drop scattered ±0.34 — 68 % of the sheet's width** — so it appeared somewhere
   different every beat. **Visual sync needs an anchor to pulse in place**; scattered
   impacts read as noise however perfectly they are timed. This also explained "after the
   verse starts the sync feels less tight": the arc response brings in three more scattering
   regions exactly when the band arrives.

**Two of the design's own claims were retired on evidence rather than defended.**

- **§1's "a listener can point at a ripple and say *that was the snare*."** §7 R3 had already
  flagged stem-region legibility as ungrounded; eleven live viewings never produced it.
  Regions are now spatial variety keyed to bar position, not instrument identity.
- **§7 R5's jitter**, added because "orderly may read as mechanical". It was the thing
  destroying the connection. Reversing it is what made the beat legible.

**Per-note melodic routing is closed, not deferred.** MEL.1 measured guitar note events at
31 % grid coherence against a ~20 % random baseline, with a 41 % drums control proving the
detector works. Distortion adds harmonics rather than amplitude, so a note inside a
sustained chord wall has no detectable attack. This is a property of the material.

**Certification obligations.** D-157 flash gate added at cert (it had never existed for this
preset) and measured **maxΔ/frame 0.0048** against the 0.05 bar, luma range 0.068–0.170.
Catalog count 26, certified 15 → 16.

**One instrument was demoted to report-only.** The "tether" correlation reads 0.056 / 0.136 /
0.316 / 0.518 for the *same configuration* depending on window length — it describes the
window, not the preset. Its DIRECTION was still what revealed that the display-only swell
never reached the sim, so it is kept as a diagnostic and asserts nothing.

**The durable lesson, beyond this preset: when a preset does not read as synced, check which
LAYER of the audio hierarchy is driving it before touching timing.** Ten rounds of accurate
event timing could not compensate for a missing continuous driver.

## D-213: Delete the zero-consumer dormant capabilities — RMENV.2/.3 gallery environment and MFX.1 temporal upscaler (RECON, Matt 2026-08-03)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-03). **EXECUTED at RECON.14 (2026-08-25)** — see ENGINEERING_PLAN §RECON.14.

**Decision.** Delete the gallery-environment capability (**RMENV.2** `ibl_gallery_env()` + the `environment` sidecar field and its `environmentType` mapping, **RMENV.3** the ray-march miss-path background) and the **MFX.1** MetalFX temporal upscaler (`MetalFXTemporalUpscaler.swift`, `RayMarchPipeline+MetalFX.swift`). **RMENV.1 multi-light (`scene_lights`) is explicitly retained** — it has three live consumers (Ferrofluid Ocean, Lumen Mosaic, Volumetric Lithograph) and is not part of this decision.

**Why.** Both were retained as "reusable capability, no consumer yet" — RMENV.2/.3 by D-187, MFX.1 by D-201 after Fractal Fly-By was retired. The 2026-08-03 production audit measured the consumer count and found it is **zero, and structurally so**: no preset sets `"environment"` in any of the 28 sidecars, so `environmentType` is always 0 and `ibl_gallery_env()` is unreachable — and **KSRB.2, the production wiring that would let a preset opt in at all, was never built**. RMENV.2/.3 is therefore not merely unused; there is no path by which a preset could use it today. MFX.1's motivating preset no longer exists.

This applies the rule already established at **D-203**, when the rebuilt stage light rig was fully decommissioned the same day Hyperbolic Lattice was stopped at the concept gate: *good work is not a reason to keep code with no consumer.* The same reasoning that retired the rig retires these. It also matches the authoring-discipline rule that "reusable infrastructure" is not a defense for keeping deleted-concept code (D-097: siblings, not subclasses).

**What the deletion costs, and why that is acceptable.** Nothing at runtime — these paths never execute. The cost is optionality: a future preset wanting an image-based gallery environment, or wanting temporal upscaling, would rebuild rather than re-enable. That is the right trade because (a) the re-enable was never actually possible without building KSRB.2 anyway, and (b) both remain recoverable from git history if a concept ever calls for them. The saving is real: both capabilities thread through the four-way 240-byte `SceneUniforms` mirror and the GPU contract, so every future contract change currently has to reason about branches nothing reaches.

**Scope note.** This is a decision, not a completed increment. The deletion touches the GPU contract (`SceneUniforms` mirror across the Swift struct, `PresetLoader+Preamble`, `+WarpPreamble`, and `Common.metal`), `IBLManager`, `IBL.metal`, `RayMarch.metal`, `PresetDescriptor`, and three test suites — it needs its own increment with the contract-lockstep discipline, not a drive-by edit. Supersedes the retention halves of **D-187** and **D-201**; both remain valid on everything else they decided.

**References.** D-187 (RMENV retention), D-201 (Fractal Fly-By retirement + MFX.1 retention), D-203 (light-rig decommission precedent), D-097 (siblings not subclasses). Audit evidence: RECON, 2026-08-03.

## D-212: Fractal Tree keeps the low-fidelity look — V.10 painterly uplift cancelled, reference set transfers to Goldengrove (FTR.1, Matt 2026-08-03)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-03).

**Decision.** Fractal Tree stays a flat, graphic, low-fidelity preset. The V.10 painterly uplift (bark POM, translucent foliage, wind, golden-hour lighting) is **cancelled**, and its 14 curated reference images transfer to Goldengrove, which already exists to carry that target. The sidecar is reclassified `rubric_profile: lightweight`. The work now scoped for the preset is **audio reactivity and certification**, not fidelity.

Matt's framing: *"I like the low-fidelity look, but if it stays this way, it will need to react to the music more accurately and more strongly."*

**Why the reclassification is the load-bearing half.** `FractalTree.json` declared no `rubric_profile`, so it defaulted to `full` — one of the nine full-rubric artistic presets under the D-067 / §12 split. `FidelityRubricTests` recorded it as `"Fractal Tree": false, // full; M3 fails`. M3 is the ≥ 3-distinct-materials gate; Fractal Tree writes flat HSV with no lighting and no G-buffer, so **M3 is unreachable without abandoning the look Matt just said he wants**. Certification was blocked by classification, not by quality. `lightweight` grades what actually matters here — audio coupling, coverage, readability at silence and peak. Same call already made for Plasma, Waveform, Nebula, and Spectral Cartograph.

The gate value does **not** change: lightweight L2 is the same M4 check, and Fractal Tree's source contains no D-026 deviation field, so `meetsAutomatedGate` stays `false` — now for an actionable reason (FTR.2 fixes it) rather than a structural one.

**The measured evidence.** Session `2026-08-03T15-05-43Z` (Smashing Pumpkins — *Hummer*, 80.4 BPM, M2 Pro, 2695 frames, `verdict=clean`), first 10 s of AGC/EMA warmup discarded, 2114 frames analysed.

| Route | Promised | Measured on real music | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| branch count ← `bass_att` | 3 → 63 | 21 → 63 (p05→p95); saturates at 63 for 5.1 % of frames | alive |
| trunk length ← `bass_att` | 0.40 → 0.62 | 0.434 → 0.558 | alive — **same primitive** |
| thickness ← `bass_att` | 0.044 → 0.054 | 11.7 % swing | alive — **same primitive again** |
| canopy spread ← `mid_att` | 22° → 29° | **21.99° → 22.41° — 0.42° total** | **dead** |
| tip shimmer ← `treb_att` | +0.12 brightness | **+0.0004 → +0.0026** | **dead** |
| leaf hue ← `spectral_centroid` | green → golden | **4.1° of hue** | **dead** |
| beat flash ← `beat_bass` | short accent | non-zero on 90.4 % of frames | alive, reads as glow |

Three findings follow, and each one is a rule the repo already had:

1. **The dead routes are the `SHADER_CRAFT.md` §14 liveness failure verbatim.** `mid_att` means 0.056 and `treble_att` means 0.010 post-AGC on this material; the shader multiplies them by 0.12 and 0.18 — coefficients written as if those bands swing 0→1. §14 measured `f.mid`/`f.treble` at stddev < 0.02 on bass-dominant music. Fractal Tree predates that finding and was never re-measured against it. The session log flagged it in-line: `low treble: high-register visuals will read faint (treble 1.17%)`.
2. **Three visual layers share one primitive** — the FA #67 collision, and the reason the preset reads as one-dimensional. Ferrofluid Ocean rounds 56–65 is the same case study.
3. **`bass_att` is the wrong tap for sensitivity.** 90th-percentile rise over 100 ms: `bass_att` **+0.024**, raw `bass` **+0.141**, `beat_composite` **+0.702**. Every visible layer sits downstream of the most heavily smoothed of those.

**The effect Matt likes is an artifact, and that is why it needs rebuilding rather than tuning.** He reads the preset as *"each note corresponds to the activation of a tree branch."* There is no per-branch concept in the code — a single global `branch_count` truncates a breadth-first branch list at an index, so branches appear in index order (branch 62 always last), nothing has an attack or decay, and the count changes on only **12.1 %** of frames by a mean of **0.28** branches. The depth-5 leaf tier exists only above count 31 — **76.4 %** of frames — so for roughly a quarter of the track the shimmer and hue routes render on geometry that is not there. Per-branch activation envelopes deliver the effect reliably instead of accidentally, and give the preset a genuine hero route.

**Chosen activation architecture: Option A (stateless, beat-grid).** Each beat, hash-select a bounded subset of branches from `pulse_beat_index`; each selected branch runs an attack/decay envelope over `beat_phase01`. Stateless, cheap, and already validated in-repo — the D-157 bounded-footprint / steady-global-luminance pattern from the FFO beat-sync work, and the Truchet Loom per-beat flip design. Rejected for now: **Option B**, a CPU-side per-branch envelope buffer on the `SkeinState` / `MitosisGeometry` precedent — more faithful to "every note", but it needs a new mesh-path buffer binding and an increment of its own. A ships first and tells us whether grid-locked activation reads the way Matt wants before B is worth funding.

**Two engine gaps this surfaces, both deferred to FTR.4 and both optional.**

- **`StemFeatures` is not bound on the mesh path.** `MeshGenerator.draw()` binds only `FeatureVector` at buffer(0) and the D-057 density scalar at buffer(1); buffer(3) is never set on the object / mesh / fragment stages. Fractal Tree therefore **cannot know which instrument is playing** — no `drums_energy_dev`, no `vocals_*`, none of the D-177 instrument-family activity. Largest single unlock for "react more accurately"; small change, but it touches shared renderer code every mesh preset uses.
- **No beat-grid coupling.** The preset reads raw live `beat_bass` (Layer 4, ±80 ms jitter) and never touches `beat_phase01`, `bar_phase01`, `pulse_phase01`, or `pulse_beat_index`. The cached grid installed cleanly on this session (`source=preparedCache, bpm=80.4`) and sits unused. This is the audio-hierarchy "feels out of sync" failure mode by the book.

**FT is a textbook case for QG.5 `response` bands, and FTR.2 must declare them.** The QG.1 route-coverage floor (`continuousStdFloor = 1e-5`) is deliberately an *aliveness* test, not an amplitude test — so all three dead routes above would pass it green. That is precisely the gap `AudioRoute.Response` was added to close ("only the first was ever checked, which is why 'the gain is too low' kept recurring with a green route"). The `audio_routes` manifest added here declares the **current, honest** routing so the rebuild shows as a diff; FTR.2 replaces it and attaches measured `response` floors.

> **Correction (FTR.2, 2026-08-03).** The diagnosis above is right; the last clause is not. Fractal Tree **cannot** attach `response` floors, because it cannot reach the gate. `ResponseBandTests` drives a Swift runtime conforming to `AudioResponseMetrics` and reads `responseMetric(_:)` after a fixture replay — Witchlight has `WitchlightPath`. Fractal Tree has **no Swift-side code**: every visual quantity named in the table above is computed in the object/mesh shader on the GPU, and the preset consists of `FractalTree.metal` + `FractalTree.json` and nothing else. `makeRuntime` returning `nil` for a band-declaring preset is a hard failure by design — "a band nobody can measure is worse than no band." Reaching the gate needs a CPU mirror of the shader's parameter math or GPU readback of mesh output, which is an infrastructure increment serving all mesh presets, not a line item inside a preset increment. FTR.2 therefore discharges the obligation as a **measured swing table in the closeout**. The gap this paragraph identifies is real and remains open; only the mechanism for closing it changed. See `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase FTR / FTR.2.

**Coefficient rule carried out of this.** Size every coefficient against the primitive's **measured p05→p95 span on a real capture**, never against a notional 0→1. That single discipline would have caught all three dead routes before they shipped.

**Documentation conflict this resolves.** Three docs disagreed about what Fractal Tree was becoming: `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` V.10 scoped the painterly uplift; `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/fractal_tree/README.md` curated 14 images serving that target (the set the preset-session checklist mandates reading before any shader edit — none of it matching what Matt wants); and `GOLDENGROVE_CONCEPT.md` said Fractal Tree was *"keeping it exactly as-is."* All three are corrected here. `SHADER_CRAFT.md §10.4` is marked superseded.

**What was NOT decided.** Whether to bind `StemFeatures` on the mesh path (FTR.4 — droppable if FTR.3 already reads right), and the M7 track set. *Hummer* is bass-dominant, the friendliest case for the current design and the harshest for `mid`/`treble`; at least one mid-rich track belongs in the M7 set before certifying.

**Gotcha for FTR.2.** The M4/L2 heuristic matches deviation fields by literal source substring, including the `f.` prefix (`f.bass_dev`, `f.mid_rel`, …). `FractalTree.metal` names its parameter `features`, so `features.bass_dev` would **not** match and L2 would stay red with correct routing in place. Rename the parameter to `f` in FTR.2, or route via the unprefixed `bass_att_rel` / `mid_att_rel` / `treb_att_rel` forms.

## D-215: Phase MD reconciled to practice — taxonomy, layout, source form and candidate list (MD.0, 2026-08-07)

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-07)

### Context

`docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` has five commits, all dated 2026-05-12, and none since. The `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` §Phase MD section was written against it. Between then and 2026-08-07, **seven Milkdrop-inspired presets shipped and certified** — Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana, Floret, Glaze, Nacre, Meniscus, Witchlight — and every one of them was authored by a process the strategy doc does not describe, producing sidecars the strategy doc's schema would reject.

An author opening §Phase MD today would be instructed to create a `family` value, a directory and a Settings toggle that D-123 deleted the day after the strategy landed. This decision writes the four supersessions back, files the D-122 trigger assessment, and hands two open product calls to Matt.

**No preset was authored, tuned or opened at MD.0.** The only code change is two `.json` sidecar edits stripping reverted D-120 fields.

### Measured catalog state (re-derived from the tree at MD.0, not inherited)

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| `Shaders/*.json` | 28 |
| `is_diagnostic: true` | 2 (Spectral Cartograph, Staged Sandbox) |
| Production presets | **26** |
| `certified: true` | **18** (matches `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets` ground truth) |
| With an `inspired_by` block | **7** |
| Of those, certified | **7** (all — Witchlight flipped at WL.CERT, `e264cbb5`, 2026-08-07) |
| Inspired-by share of roster | **27 %** (7 / 26) |
| Inspired-by share of certified | **39 %** (7 / 18) |
| `family` values across the seven | `hypnotic` ×6, `particles` ×1 |
| Swift references to `milkdrop_inspired` / `.milkdropInspired` | **0** |
| Sidecars carrying `concept_tags` / `motion_paradigm` | 2 (Meniscus, Cymatic Resonance) — stripped at MD.0 |

### The four supersessions (full text: `MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §13)

**§13.1 — Taxonomy. Superseded by D-123 (2026-05-13).** There is no `family: "milkdrop_inspired"` and no `.milkdropInspired` `PresetCategory` case; the enum is fixed at 11 cream-of-crop cases. Uplifts file into the same taxonomy as every other preset. D-123 mirrored `PresetCategory` to the pack's own theme directories *precisely so* inspired-by uplifts ingest 1:1 with no translation layer — a separate family would reintroduce the label-source inconsistency D-123 existed to remove.

The `inspired_by` sidecar block is the only marker of origin, and it is **documentation-only**: `PresetDescriptor` declares no coding key for it, `Codable` ignores it, and no engine path reads it. Whether it should be decoded and gated is a **carry-forward, deliberately not decided here** — adding decoding plus a validation gate is a real change with a real cost and belongs in its own increment.

**§13.2 — Layout. Never adopted.** `UzumeEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Milkdrop/` does not exist and will not; all 28 sidecars are flat in `Shaders/`. Presets are named for the Uzume preset (`Witchlight.metal`), not the source. Moving 7 of 28 into a subdirectory changes `PresetLoader` enumeration and every golden path for zero user-visible gain — and the `<theme>_<source_name>` convention is in direct tension with D-113 besides: a Uzume preset named after the `.milk` it was inspired by reads as a port of that `.milk`.

**§13.3 — Source form. De-facto since Dragon Bloom.** The operative inspiration corpus is the **butterchurn built-in set rendered through `tools/milkdrop-render/`** as a live oracle, not raw `.milk` files. The runtime `.milk` converter renders directory presets poorly (`MILKDROP_UPLIFT_PICKS.md` header), so the gallery Matt picks from is built from built-ins, which render faithfully. Six of seven uplifts read a butterchurn built-in JSON; only Dragon Bloom read a `.milk`, since removed at PUB.1 per D-116 bullet 4.

Consequence for provenance: **`sha256` is the hash of the source artifact actually read, and `source_form` names what that artifact was.** A bare hash with no `source_form` is ambiguous about what was hashed — which is exactly the state `DragonBloom.json` was in. Where no hash was ever taken, `sha256` is omitted and `source_form` says why; MD.0 does not invent hashes. All seven blocks normalised to the union schema; `Witchlight.json`'s bespoke `sha256_subject` key folded into `source_form` and dropped. D-116 bullet 4 is unaffected and still binding.

**§13.4 — Candidate selection.** `docs/presets/MILKDROP_UPLIFT_PICKS.md` (2026-06-01) is the operative candidate list. D-112's nine named `.milk` candidates and §5's theme-stratified lists are historical; **none was used for any shipped uplift.** §5's lists were selected on transpiler-proofness, a criterion that died with the transpiler at the D-110 amendment. The operative criterion is Matt's eye on a rendered gallery — the only one that has produced certified presets.

**§13.5 — Settings exposure. DELETED (Matt 2026-08-07, MD.0 DECISION-NEEDED #1 — option A).** `phosphene.settings.visuals.milkdrop.inspired` was never adopted, and the QR.4 / D-091 `#if DEBUG` stub standing in for it — `phosphene.settings.visuals.includeMilkdropPresets`, "Coming in a future update," `.disabled(true)` — is **removed**: store property, persistence key, view-model flag, `#if DEBUG` view row, two `Localizable.strings` entries, and three tests. App-test count 407 → 404.

**Why delete rather than ship.** D-119 commits Uzume's identity to being Milkdrop-influenced; a switch that removes the majority of the catalog contradicts the brand call. The per-category exclusions already give a listener the granular control they would actually reach for.

**The shipped toggle was inert, not merely hidden** — `SettingsStore.includeMilkdropPresets` was read by `SettingsViewModel` and `VisualsSettingsSection` and by nothing else, while `PresetScoringContextProvider` builds `excludedFamilies` from `excludedPresetCategories`, a different key; flipping it changed nothing about preset selection. **And it could not have been wired honestly through `family`:** under D-123 the seven uplifts sit in `hypnotic` and `particles` alongside seven Uzume-native presets — Aurora Veil, Plasma, Filigree, Mitosis, Cytokinesis, Murmuration, Nebula, five of them certified — so family-based exclusion would have removed Uzume's own work. The only honest wiring is a per-preset `inspired_by` check, needing `PresetDescriptor` decoding that does not exist. Already-persisted `UserDefaults` values are orphaned and harmless; no migration ships.

**§13.6 — MD.1 retired.** See below.

**§13.7 — The per-preset workflow as actually practised** replaces §12.1's prose: render gallery → Matt picks by eye (from motion, not stills) → reference curation + `<PRESET>_DESIGN.md` / `_PLAN.md` authored before any code (D-064; the WL.1/WL.2 and MEN.1/MEN.2 splits are the pattern) → hand-author under the D-116 discipline rule → M7 plus the mandatory D-121 side-by-side before `certified: true`. Steps 3 and 5 are where the time goes. §12.1's "~2–3 days per preset" is falsified by the record: Witchlight took ten increments, Meniscus eleven.

### MD.1 — retired, not re-scoped

MD.1 specced `docs/MILKDROP_GRAMMAR.md`: a variable / function / HLSL audit across the 9,795-preset pack, framed as a read-only authoring aid for someone opening a source `.milk` for the first time. Under §13.3, **no author opens a `.milk` at all** — the consumer does not exist.

Re-scoping the audit to the butterchurn-JSON corpus was considered and rejected. Seven certified uplifts are enough evidence that a syntax reference is not what gates authoring: what gates it is reference curation and the concept bar, which is where the WL and MEN increments actually spent their rounds. Re-scoping would spend a session producing a document with no demonstrated demand — which is the **D-118 opportunity-cost argument**, and it was right, now applied to its own sibling increment. Retire it; if an author ever needs the corpus surface, they can generate exactly the slice they need in the session that needs it.

### D-120 residue — closed

D-123 superseded D-120 and its five commits (`a2e8a6aa..5f29aefe`) were reverted in `0981ca4f` on the same day they landed. Two sidecars — `Meniscus.json` and `CymaticResonance.json` — nonetheless carried `concept_tags` and `motion_paradigm` at MD.0. Both stripped; parse-gated; no golden moved.

**The revert was clean. The fields came back.** `docs/prompts/PHASE_CA_KICKOFF_CA4_ORCHESTRATOR_2026-05-20.md` §3 asked a session to verify the reversion, and the CA.4 audit (2026-05-20) ran the grep and correctly reported zero residue — `docs/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/ORCHESTRATOR.md` §8 and §"Updates needed" both say so. The residue **postdates that audit**: `CymaticResonance.json` was created 2026-07-22 (`b9982dbb`, CR.1) and `Meniscus.json` 2026-08-03 (`72707e68`, MEN.2a), each two to three months after the grep came back empty.

**The vector is stale design docs, not an incomplete revert.** Both presets were authored from plan documents that still prescribe the reverted fields: `docs/presets/psychedelic_geometry/PG_CR_CYMATIC_RESONANCE.md` specifies `concept_tags` and `motion_paradigm` in its sidecar block, and `docs/presets/MENISCUS_PLAN.md` §366–368 does the same, citing D-120 by number. `PG_0_OVERVIEW.md` even hedges — "confirm the field is still live in the sidecar schema at implementation time" — and the check was not run. A prose reverted-decision leaves no trace an author trips over; a design doc that names the field does. All three docs now carry a D-123 supersession note, and `ORCHESTRATOR.md`'s two "clean" claims are annotated with the recurrence rather than contradicted (they were true when written).

Neither field is reintroduced. D-123 reverted them on a reasoned basis — the planner is multi-preset-per-song and does not want back-to-back repeat penalties. **This is a recurrence, not a leftover, which means it can recur again**; the durable fix is a decode-time or gate-time rejection of unknown sidecar keys, which is the same missing mechanism as the `inspired_by` decoding carry-forward below. Not built at MD.0.

### D-122 trigger assessment

| # | Trigger | State | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Milestone — health check after the 10th inspired-by preset | At **7** | **Not fired** |
| 2 | Takedown signal | None on record | **Not fired** |
| 3 | Discipline-rule failure — M7 rejects an uplift for substantive similarity | Never occurred | **Not fired** |
| 4 | Catalog-ratio drift — inspired-by share below ~50 % before the second bundle | **27 % roster / 39 % certified** | **FIRED** (on the letter) |

**Trigger 3 is worth recording for the direction it did *not* fire in.** No M7 has ever rejected an uplift for being too *close* to its source. Witchlight's 2026-08-03 M7 rejected it for being too *unlike* the source — the opposite axis from the one D-122 trigger 3 watches. Across seven uplifts the observed failure mode is **under-fidelity, not over-fidelity.** Anyone contemplating tightening D-116 should know that the empirical record points the other way.

**Trigger 4 fires, and MD.0 does not halt Phase MD.** Two readings:

- *The trigger is reading a transient.* D-122 trigger 4 is written against "before the second release bundle," and the **first** bundle has not shipped. The catalog is growing on both sides simultaneously (Uzume-native cert reviews ran in parallel with the uplifts), so a below-50 % share this early is the expected shape of a catalog that has not yet been composed into a release, not evidence that the work-distribution model is unhealthy. This is the reading MD.0 takes.
- *The trigger is reading a real gap.* D-119 committed the product identity to majority-inspired-by, and three months of work has moved the share to 27 %. If uplifts are structurally slower than the strategy assumed — and §13.7 says they are — then the ratio will not close on its own, and the brand commitment is the thing that has to move.

Both readings hang on the same question as D-115, which is why MD.0 routed them to Matt together rather than resolving either.

**Resolved (Matt 2026-08-07): the first reading. Phase MD proceeds.** By picking C' (10+10) for D-115 — see below — Matt made D-119's ≥ 50 % a **steady-state target rather than a first-release gate**, which is exactly the framing under which a 27 % share before the first bundle is a transient and not drift. Trigger 4 is recorded as **fired and reviewed, outcome `proceed`**, per D-122's "each trigger produces an explicit review session with documented outcome." Triggers 1–3 remain unfired; trigger 1 (the milestone health check) is the next one due, after the 10th inspired-by preset — which under C' is also the first-release threshold, so the two land together.

### Why this is a decision and not just a doc edit

The strategy doc got ahead of the work in four specific places, and the gap was load-bearing: the done-when criteria of a live increment (MD.5) instructed an author to build three things that no longer exist. That is not staleness, it is a map to a demolished place. Filing the reconciliation as a decision makes the supersessions citable — §13 items now have D-numbers behind them the way §12's did.

### Carry-forward

- **DECISION-NEEDED #1 — ANSWERED (Matt 2026-08-07): delete the toggle.** Implemented at MD.0; see §13.5 above. No follow-up.
- **DECISION-NEEDED #2 — ANSWERED (Matt 2026-08-07): C' (10 + 10).** D-115 resolved after twelve weeks open; amendment block filed on D-115. First-release bundle is ten Uzume-native + ten Milkdrop-inspired; **three more uplifts to the D-114 threshold.** D-119's ≥ 50 % is a steady-state target, not a first-release gate.
- **Unknown-key rejection — CLOSED at QG.7 (2026-08-09).** `PresetSidecarKeyGateTests` asserts every top-level sidecar key is decoded by `PresetDescriptor` or allow-listed with a stated reason, and that every `inspired_by` block matches the §13.3 union schema. Known keys are parsed from `PresetDescriptor.CodingKeys` rather than restated, so the gate cannot go stale when a field is added. Verified in both directions: re-injecting `concept_tags` / `motion_paradigm` into `CymaticResonance.json` and `sha256_subject` into `Witchlight.json` turns it red, naming each key and file. The D-120 recurrence documented above can no longer happen silently. Also surfaced by building it: `LumenMosaic.json`'s `lumen_mosaic` block is decoded by nothing — its values live as Swift constants in `LumenPatternEngine.swift`, kept in sync by a prose doc comment with no mechanism. Allow-listed with the trap named; whether to decode or delete it is a Lumen call.
- **`inspired_by` decoding — still open.** Whether `PresetDescriptor` should *decode* the block rather than merely tolerate it is unresolved. QG.7 deliberately does not settle it: it makes the tolerance explicit and auditable instead of accidental. Decoding remains the prerequisite for any per-preset origin check (the wiring the deleted Settings toggle would have needed).
- **Amendment blocks** appended to D-105, D-106, D-110, D-112 and D-115. Original text untouched, per the D-111 / D-103 precedent.
- **No `PresetCategory` case added, no `Shaders/Milkdrop/` created, no golden regenerated, no preset touched.**

## D-216: Stave — the stem channel comes off the traces and onto the field (CHR.2, Matt 2026-08-14)

**Status:** Accepted. Resolves CHR.2 DECISION-NEEDED #1 (option D). Unblocks CHR.3.

### What was gated

CHR.2 was a throwaway, motion-gated look spike whose only deliverable was a verdict on the
driver Matt settled on 2026-08-13:

| layer | driver | measured latency |
|---|---|---|
| trace position | band split — rhythm `subBass+lowBass`, melodic `midHigh+highMid+high`, each EMA-centred | ≈0.3 s |
| trace colour + weight | per-stem — `drums+bass` vs `vocals+other` | **3.0 s** |

Rendered on four captures picked from re-measured worst cases — Bohemian Rhapsody (93.4 %
common mode, the corpus worst), Bleed (low excursion), Dance Yrself Clean (high excursion),
Clair De Lune (sparse) — as flat-colour controls and stem-coloured versions of **identical
geometry**, so the pair isolates exactly one variable.

### Half 1 passed

Two band-driven traces read as two voices on three of four captures. **Median trace-to-beat
offset 0 ms on every capture** — the split driver delivered precisely the in-time marks it
was chosen for. Gridlines derived from `beatPhase01` wraps match `grid_bpm` exactly
(71/71, 97/98, 172/174.6, inter-beat CV 0.02–0.13): the grid is the beat, not decoration.

Two qualifications, both CHR.3's to resolve: one fixed gain does **not** survive the
excursion span (Dance Yrself Clean clips off frame; a per-trace normaliser fixes it at the
cost of absolute-amplitude comparison), and grids above ~150 bpm read as graph paper rather
than pulse (Bleed: 22.9 gridlines per 8 s window).

### Half 2 failed, on a measurement

Cross-correlating each trace's position driver against its own colour driver:

| capture | pair | best lag | r at that lag | **r at lag 0** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bohemian Rhapsody | rhythm | 5.5 s | +0.748 | **−0.084** |
| Bleed | rhythm | 5.4 s | +0.770 | **+0.049** |
| Dance Yrself Clean | rhythm | 5.4 s | +0.875 | **−0.081** |
| Clair De Lune | melodic | 5.4 s | +0.198 | **−0.018** |
| post-fix capture (`2026-08-12T19-06-54Z`, current code) | rhythm / melodic | **3.0 s** | +0.515 / +0.103 | **+0.251 / +0.005** |

**At the moment a mark is drawn, its colour carries essentially no information about its own
position.** The renders were made on the pre-BUG086.1 capture (5.4 s); CHR.3 faces 3.0 s,
which on an 8 s window is still 38 % of the screen. The direction does not change.

Two further defects in colour-as-identity, independent of the lag:

1. **Hue is a static label assigned by frequency band**, not by the audio. Amber means "the
   trace driven by `subBass+lowBass`". It never changes, so it tells a viewer which line is
   which and nothing about what is playing.
2. **The label is asserted where the instruments do not exist.** Clair De Lune is solo
   piano; its traces are still labelled `drums+bass` and `vocals+other`. Both are false and
   nothing in the image says so.

What the stem channel *does* deliver, and legibly: brightness and weight bursts that read as
**"this group is active now"** — activity, not identity.

### The decision

**Stop pairing a fast mark with a slow channel.** Stems stay in the preset but move to a
surface with no per-beat commitment — field tint, backdrop, or grid luminance — where 3 s of
lag is invisible and "the room is warmer now" is the correct register for a slow signal. The
traces carry only band-derived, in-time information.

**Accepted consequence: the preset can no longer say "this trace is the drums."** The concept
sentence changes from instrument voices to **low against high, ruled by the beat, in a room
the stems tint.** The D-121 divergence argument survives on different ground — stems still
shape the image and Milkdrop has none, and the beat grid remains structurally un-fakeable —
but per-mark instrument identity is out of scope, and §0's remaining "four separate voices"
language is now fully retired rather than merely re-scoped.

### Rejected

- **A — drop the identity claim entirely** (two traces, no stems). Honest, and it is what the
  spike demonstrably delivers, but it discards a working capability for nothing in return.
- **B — weight or texture instead of hue.** Cheap and in keeping with the source's dotted
  register, and CHR.2 showed weight modulation *is* more legible than brightness. But it
  changes the medium, not the lag; whatever channel carries the stem signal on a trace is
  still 3 s behind the mark it decorates.
- **C — stem-driven position.** The only route back to identity-in-the-geometry. Weighed and
  rejected 2026-08-13; CHR.2 strengthens the case against, because the cost of the split is
  now measured rather than assumed.

### Also retired at CHR.2 — two CHR.1 claims, both load-bearing

**"Converge and diverge" is gone.** CHR.1 §7a gated direction A on a divergence ratio of 0.75
against a 1.45 independence null. That statistic is dominated by the rhythm/melodic
**amplitude mismatch** — `std R / std M` is **4.4–17.5×** across the corpus — and once both
traces are drawn at visible scale (per-trace gain, which is a precondition for the melodic
voice existing on screen at all) it collapses onto `√(2(1−r))`, carrying no information
beyond `r`. What survives is **near-independence** (r −0.27…+0.27 on 13 of 15 tracks), which
is the property the concept actually wants — but it is not the band locking together and
pulling apart, and the pitch must stop claiming it.

**CHR.1 §4's common-mode table has shifted track labels** and the correction was never
committed. Re-measured from `stems.csv` this increment: worst is **Bohemian Rhapsody 93.4 %**
and Superstition 93.1 %; **Take Five is 82.9 %, among the easiest.** CHR.1 §5's *"Jazz is the
worst … the opposite of the intuition that sparse material would separate best"* is the label
shift showing and must not be carried forward. Root cause (recorded earlier, off-repo): a
`track='([^']*)'` log regex terminating at the apostrophe in `Stayin' Alive`, dropping it from
a list index-aligned to segments. A correction banner is now on the CHR.1 file.

### Unfixed and carried into CHR.3

**Bleed is a genuine miss** (r +0.695, drawn divergence 0.78): its two traces collapse into a
single flat band and no amount of looking separates them. Predicted by measurement before the
render, and **not reachable by tuning** — it is what the material does. CHR.3 should not spend
rounds on it.

tables, repro), `docs/presets/STAVE_PLAN.md` §CHR.1 AMENDMENT, D-121 (divergence axis),
D-215 (Phase MD), BUG-086 / BUG086.1 (the stem latency this decision routes around).

## D-217: Rosette — full cartouche, the frame ships with the wings (WHIT.0, Matt 2026-08-25)

**Status:** Accepted. Resolves WHIT.0 DECISION-NEEDED #1. Unblocks WHIT.1a.

### What was gated

WHIT.0 was a throwaway, motion-gated look spike for the Rosette preset (a two-term epicycle
port of *Arabesque*'s morphing emblem). Task 5 asked whether the mirrored coloured wing arcs +
small ellipses at the frame edges (`ARABESQUE_FILM_NOTES` F4) carry real compositional weight
or are decoration, per `WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §12 #1's thinness worry. Rendered the same morph
moment (`a=0.75`, five broad petals) with and without the wings, same figure, same scale.

### The evidence

Without the wings, the figure floats alone in a large dead black field — legible, but reads as
a diagram. With them, the same figure reads as a composed picture: the wings anchor the frame's
edges, add colour where the figure itself is deliberately white/pale (F3), and give the
composition a sense of scale the bare figure lacks. Both renders went to Matt rather than being
described.

### Decision

**Full cartouche — the wings ship as part of the frame, not an optional extra or a later
uplift.** No qualifications recorded.

### Consequence

WHIT.1a (reference curation) and WHIT.1b (design doc) should treat the wing arcs + ellipses as
in-scope for the base preset from the start, not a stretch feature to defer.

**References.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase WHIT / Increment WHIT.0 (full verdict, all six
tasks); `docs/prompts/WHIT0_LOOK_SPIKE.md`; `docs/presets/ARABESQUE_FILM_NOTES_2026-08-19.md` F4;
`docs/presets/WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §12 #1.

## D-218: Rosette maquette landed (WHIT.1c, count 29 → 30)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false`. Pending Matt's live M7.

### What landed

`UzumeEngine/Sources/Presets/Shaders/Rosette.{metal,json}`, moved and adapted from the WHIT.0
look-spike's throwaway location (`Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Presets/Fixtures/Rosette/`) after
WHIT.1a curated `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/rosette/` and WHIT.1b wrote
`docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md`. Family `geometric`, `rubric_profile: "lightweight"`,
`passes: ["direct", "mv_warp"]`. **No audio coupling** — the morph runs on a triangle-wave clock
only; `audio_routes: []`. That is WHIT.1d.

### Architecture, revised from the program doc's original proposal

`WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §6 proposed porting Dragon Bloom's raw `line_strip` marks configuration.
WHIT.0 built and validated a **fullscreen-triangle SDF-in-fragment overlay instead** (Skein's
`skein_geometry_vertex`/`_fragment` pattern) — Metal's line-primitive rasterization has no
antialiasing and no variable width, which would have undercut the stroke fidelity the whole
concept depends on. `ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` §6 records this as the authoritative architecture for
Rosette; the program doc's §6 is superseded for this preset specifically.

### Pre-authoring checklist, run before writing anything (`ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` §10)

1. **Profiled the numerical nearest-point search at 1080p before any other work.** The
   coarse-40 + bisect-7 search (no closed-form SDF exists for a self-intersecting two-term
   epicycle) measures **5.8ms p50 / 6.2ms p95** for the geometry-overlay pass alone, on an M2 Pro,
   against a 16.67ms/frame @60fps total budget — comfortably inside, resolving the design doc's
   one flagged open engineering risk. `complexity_cost.tier1` set from this measurement;
   `tier2` (M3+) is an unverified ~0.6x scaling estimate, not measured.
2. **Halation retuned.** WHIT.0's shipped value came from a thumbnail-based estimate (~4.4x core
   width) that read too generous once viewed at the curated reference's proper crop scale
   (`06_specular_stroke_core_halo.jpg`, ~1.5–2x). Retuned to ~1.75x.
3. **`PresetAcceptanceTests` needed the same exemption five other marks-on-top presets already
   carry** (Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana, Nacre, Floret, Glaze, Skein): the standalone
   `rosette_fragment` is an intentional flat-black stub — real content lives entirely in the
   scene-geometry overlay (`strandsOnTop`), which the acceptance harness's fragment-only render
   cannot see. Added to `test_nonBlack_atSteadyEnergy` and `test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy`;
   `test_noWhiteClip_steadyEnergy` and `test_beatResponse_bounded` pass without exemption (a flat
   black frame trivially clears both).

### What did not land

No `.metal`/JSON changes beyond the move; no audio routing; no certification. The two-term
epicycle's known miss (never producing a true straight-edged pentagon — confirmed against
`05_macro_pentagon_straight_edges.jpg`) is unchanged and not chased.

**References.** `docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` (full architecture + grounding audit);
`docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase WHIT / Increment WHIT.1c; D-217 (full cartouche, unchanged).

## D-219: Rosette harmony coupling — 3 of 5 routes; two filed to WHIT.1d-2 (WHIT.1d)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false` unchanged. Unblocks WHIT.1d-2 (a scoped follow-up, not a
blocker to certification of the three shipped routes).

### What was gated

`WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §7 proposed five audio routes for Rosette. QG.1 requires auditing the code
before declaring a route, and the increment ladder for WHIT.1d states the gate as "RouteCoverageTests
green on all five routes, **or a filed defect**" — explicitly anticipating that not all five would
land cleanly in one pass.

### The audit finding

Two of the five routes need a value held **across frames**, and Rosette carries zero CPU-side
per-preset state (unlike Skein/Witchlight/Nacre, each of which has its own state object wired
through the shared `RenderPipeline` dispatch files):

1. **`tonalPhaseFifths`** is a raw ±π sawtooth (`TonalAnalyzer` emits it RAW; `CircularPhaseSmoother.swift`
   documents why: D-209 found that reading it straight into a visual channel produces a jump at the
   seam — measured on Fractal Tree, 144°/p95 per-update jump, Matt's M7: *"Color changes feel
   glitchy, not intentional."* Fixed there by a stateful two-pole circular smoother, `mutating`,
   genuinely needs memory.
2. **`harmonicFlux`** "spikes at chord changes" (`kind: accent`) — a discrete symmetry-order step
   driven directly off it would flicker every spike, violating `WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §2's explicit
   anti-contract ("the symmetry order must never flicker... held for tens of seconds"). Needs a
   hold-timer, which is state.

A secondary finding on `tonalPhaseFifths`: the original mapping ("where in the morph family") and
`tonalConsonance`'s mapping ("how tight the figure is") both target the SAME single scalar DOF
(`a`) in the two-term epicycle generator that WHIT.0 validated — an FA #67 one-primitive-per-layer
conflict baked into the pre-spike design docs, not discovered until this audit. Resolution when
WHIT.1d-2 builds it: map the smoothed phase to a rotation of the figure only (wings stay fixed,
preserving D-217's frame) — a genuinely distinct visual channel.

### Decision

**Ship the three routes that need no new state now** (`figure_tightness`←`tonalConsonance`,
`stroke_presence`←`bassDev`, `morph_floor_rate`←`midAttRel` — all continuous, all stateless, all
green on `RouteCoverageTests`). **File `tonalPhaseFifths`/`harmonicFlux` as deferred, not build
blind.** Building either means adding a new per-preset state object and wiring it through
`RenderPipeline+PresetSwitching.swift` / `RenderPipeline+MVWarpSetup.swift` /
`RenderPipeline+MVWarpScene.swift` — real, separate, scoped engine-adjacent work, not something to
fold silently into "add audio routes" the way the three stateless routes could be.

### Consequence

WHIT.1d-2 is a real follow-up increment, not busywork: build `RosetteState` (circular-phase
smoother + symmetry hold-timer), wire it through the shared dispatch files the same way
Skein/Witchlight/Nacre already do, add the rotation + symmetry-order-step behaviour, declare the
two remaining routes, and re-run `RouteCoverageTests` for all five green.

**References.** `docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` §5 (full implementation + the sqrt calibration
curve); `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase WHIT / Increment WHIT.1d; `CircularPhaseSmoother.swift`
(D-209); D-217/D-218 (unchanged).

## D-220: Rosette — the remaining two harmony routes shipped (WHIT.1d-2)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false` unchanged. Closes the WHIT.1d-2 follow-up D-219 filed.

### What was built

`RosetteState` (`Presets/Rosette/RosetteState.swift`) — Skein/Gossamer's minimal per-preset-state
shape: one `storageModeShared` `MTLBuffer`, a `tick(deltaTime:features:)` that updates internal
state then flushes a fixed-stride GPU mirror struct (`RosetteUniformsGPU`, matching `RosetteUniforms`
in `Rosette.metal` byte-for-byte, bound at fragment buffer(6)).

1. **`morph_position` <- `tonalPhaseFifths`.** A D-209 circular smoother — cos/sin tracked
   separately via EMA (τ=3s, matching `CircularPhaseSmoother`'s own default), recombined via
   `atan2` — feeding a 2D rotation applied to the figure's sample coordinate (`pf`) only, before
   the distance search. `q` (the wing arcs) is untouched, so D-217's fixed frame is preserved.
   Resolves the D-219 FA #67 finding: `figure_tightness` and `morph_position` are now genuinely
   distinct visual channels (tightness of the curve vs. its orientation), not two routes fighting
   over the same scalar `a`.
2. **`symmetry_order_step` <- `harmonicFlux`.** A hold-timer (`minHoldSeconds=24s`,
   `fluxStepThreshold=0.09`, calibrated against TONAL.2b's p99=0.110) steps the epicycle's `n`
   through Whitney's own sequence (5→6→4, `WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` §2) on a qualifying spike, never
   more often than the hold window — honouring the explicit anti-contract ("the symmetry order
   must never flicker"). `rosetteCurve`/`rosetteDist` took `n` as a third parameter (previously
   the fixed constant `kRosetteN = 5.0`); the `aMin`/`aMax` tightness calibration (task 2's CPU
   sweep, n=5) is reused as-is for the stepped orders — a reasonable approximation, not re-swept
   per `n`.

### Wiring — the first WHIT increment to touch the app layer

Unlike WHIT.1c/1d (preset-local, engine-package only), the two stateful routes needed
`RosetteState` threaded through `UzumeApp`: a `var rosetteState: RosetteState?` on
`VisualizerEngine`, a `bindRosetteRuntime` in `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift` (mirrors
`bindGossamerRuntime` — allocate, bind `rosetteBuffer` at fragment slot 6, wire
`setMeshPresetTick` to call `.tick(deltaTime:features:)` every frame), a
`case "Rosette": bindRosetteRuntime(desc)` in the `bindStatefulPresetRuntime(for:)` switch, a
`rosetteState = nil` teardown in `applyPreset()`'s shared reset block, `"Rosette"` added to
`StatefulRuntimeRegistry.knownPresetNames` (`ParticleGeometryRegistry.swift`), and
`rosetteState?.reset()` on track change (a new track's fifths phase starts fresh rather than
gliding in from the previous track's smoothed value; the symmetry order restarts at the stated
base, 5-fold).

### Found live: a second harness with its own hardcoded preset registry

`MultiPassRenderHarness`'s `renderMVWarp` case (used by `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests`, a real-dispatch
flash-safety measurement — separate from `_acceptanceFixture`) only special-cased `SkeinState`
binding at buffer(6); Rosette fell into the `else` branch with the slot unbound. An unbound
buffer(6) reads zeros, collapsing `rosetteDist`'s `n` to 0 — the epicycle's second term becomes
identical to the first (`t2 = -(n-1)*t = t` at n=0), so `rosetteCurve` degenerates to a fixed
unit circle regardless of `a`, meaning the figure stops responding to ANY audio input including
the three already-shipped WHIT.1d routes. `rosetteIsFlashSafe` correctly measured this as a
harness fault, not a false pass: *"'Rosette' rendered static (Δ0.0026) under the worst-case
beat+stem train — the harness is not reaching its real multi-pass response, so the measurement
is INVALID (not safe). Fix the harness setup; do not weaken this guard."* Fixed by binding a
`RosetteState` in `renderMVWarp` the same way Skein's is bound, ticked once per rendered frame.

### Verification

All 5 declared `audio_routes` green on `RouteCoverageTests` (206 routes / 22 presets / 0 red).
`RosetteMVWarpAccumulationTest` gained a new regression guard (`test_rosette_rotationAndSymmetryCoupling`)
directly exercising the rotation and symmetry-step behaviour through the real geometry-overlay
dispatch. `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests.rosetteIsFlashSafe` re-measured post-fix: MEASURED (not the prior
invalid UNMEASURED(static)), 0.00 flashes/s, luma 0.033–0.037 (Δ0.004) — SAFE.

## D-221: Rosette symmetry-order steps become a smooth transition, not an instant jump (WHIT.2a)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false` unchanged.

### What was gated

Immediately after BUG-104's curve-continuity fix, Matt's next live look at Rosette: *"Still too
basic."* Asked what specifically read as unfinished, he gave two concrete directions — this
decision covers the first: *"Like arabesque by Whitney, this preset MUST use motion to smoothly
transition from one pattern to another, with lines separating and reattaching at different
points."* (The second — a full 3D conversion — is tracked separately; see the WHIT.2a closeout
in `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`.)

### The finding

`RosetteState`'s symmetry-order hold-timer (D-220) wrote the new integer `n` to the GPU buffer
the instant a qualifying `harmonicFlux` spike fired — a hard cut from 5-fold to 6-fold with no
intermediate frames. Whitney's own films (and Matt's literal ask) treat a pattern change as
motion, not a state swap.

The fix required no shader change: `rosetteCurve`'s formula (`z(t) = e^{it} + a·e^{-i(n-1)t}`)
is already a continuous function of `n` — it was only ever WRITTEN discretely. Feeding it a
smoothly-varying `n` (rather than an instantly-stepped one) produces the transition for free: as
`n` moves from 5 toward 6, the curve's self-intersections continuously slide, and one lobe
visibly opens into a loose end mid-transition before the sixth lobe closes — confirmed by
rendering the actual mid-transition frame (n=5.5) and inspecting it, not by assuming the math
would look right.

### Decision

`RosetteState` interpolates `n` from the old symmetry order to the new one over
`transitionDurationSeconds = 4.0s`, smoothstep-eased (`t²(3−2t)`), instead of writing the target
value instantly. `minHoldSeconds` (24s) is unchanged and stays comfortably longer than the
transition, so a transition always finishes well before the next one can start — no overlapping
transitions to reason about. `reset()` (track change) snaps to the base order with the
transition already marked settled, so a new track never inherits an in-progress animation from
the previous one.

### Consequence: an existing test's assumption broke, and the test was wrong

`test_rosette_rotationAndSymmetryCoupling`'s symmetry-step assertion rendered a SINGLE tick after
triggering a spike and expected to see the target order already active — true under the old
instant-jump behavior, false under this one (a transition's first tick reports the ORIGINAL
value; visible movement starts on the following tick). This is the correct new behavior, not a
regression to work around: fixed the test by advancing two independent `RosetteState` instances
past `transitionDurationSeconds` (one spiked once, one never spiked) and comparing their SETTLED
renders, added `renderOneFrame`'s `externalState` parameter to support it. Never weaken an
assertion to match an accidental old behavior when the new behavior is the one that's correct.

### Verification

New unit suite `RosetteStateTests.swift` (no Metal rendering — direct Swift API, matching
`GossamerStateTests`' pattern): initial state is the settled base order; a triggering spike does
NOT move `n` within its own frame (only starts the clock); the transition is monotonic and
settles at exactly the target value once `transitionDurationSeconds` has elapsed; `reset()`
leaves no lingering animation. New env-gated diagnostic `test_rosette_transitionMotionDump`
renders named stills across an actual triggered transition for human review. Full existing
Rosette suite, `swiftlint --strict`, and the full engine suite re-run clean.

**References.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Increment WHIT.2a; `RosetteState.swift`;
`RosetteStateTests.swift`; D-220 (the symmetry-order-step mechanism this refines).

## D-222: Rosette converted from 2D `direct+mv_warp` to `ray_march` — real 3D swept-tube geometry (WHIT.2b)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false` unchanged.

### What was gated

The same live-feedback message as D-221 gave two directions; this decision covers the second:
*"The final preset should also be 3D, not 2D, to take better advantage of the latest Apple
processors."* Scoped as its own increment at D-221's filing, not attempted blind in the same
session as the symmetry-transition fix.

### The architectural approach

Rather than build a parallel forward-lit vertex-mesh system, Rosette wraps its EXISTING,
already-debugged 2D distance functions (`rosetteCurve`/`rosetteDist`/`rosetteWingDist`/
`rosetteWingEllipseDist`) in a Pythagorean tube SDF: for a planar curve lying in the z=0 plane,
`tubeSDF(p) = sqrt(dist2D(p.xy, curve)^2 + p.z^2) - tubeRadius`. The tube renders through the
engine's existing ray-march / Cook-Torrance PBR / IBL / AO / screen-space-shadow pipeline — the
same one Volumetric Lithograph, Lumen Mosaic, and Ferrofluid Ocean already run on (D-021's
`sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` contract) — not an invented rendering technique. `RosetteUniforms`
(rotation + symmetry-order state, carried forward from D-220) moves from the old `direct+mv_warp`
overlay buffer onto ray-march fragment buffer(6): `RayMarchPipeline`'s buffer slots 6/7 turned out
to be completely unused by the G-buffer fragment (unlike the direct/mv_warp/staged paths, which
reserve them), and `RenderPipeline.directPresetFragmentBuffer` was already a pipeline-agnostic
Swift property reused across mv_warp/direct/ray-march — so the conversion needed zero new
engine-wide Swift state, only threading the existing property into the ray-march call site too.
A new, generically reusable engine feature, `scene_orbit_speed` (JSON key, mirrors the existing
`scene_dolly_speed`), rotates the camera around the world Y-axis through the origin — a static
shot undersells a ray-marched tube's actual depth (roundness and self-occlusion read mainly
through parallax), so Rosette is `scene_orbit_speed`'s first consumer, not the only intended one.
`scene_backdrop: "dark"` (a real, pre-existing field — `SceneUniforms.lightingParams.w >= 0.5`)
gives a genuinely dark background decoupled from light intensity, replacing an earlier prototype
hack of near-zero light colors at very high intensity.

### Two defects found on the first live look at the converted preset

Both surfaced immediately after the conversion rendered, in the same increment, and both trace to
the technique change itself rather than a new mistake:

1. **"fidelity is poor - lines are really jagged."** The 2D version's coarse-then-bisect nearest-
   point search (BUG-104's branch-lock fix) produced a distance field accurate enough for a flat,
   unlit 2D fragment but not smooth enough for the ray-march G-buffer's tetrahedral finite-
   difference normals (`eps=0.001`) — visible as faceted, unstable shading, worst at self-
   crossings but present even on an isolated loop with no competing branch (ruling out the
   branch-seam theory two prior attempts, a smooth-min blend and more bisection precision,
   assumed). Confirmed by direct comparison: the wing arcs, which already use a dense point-to-
   segment polyline scan with no bisection, rendered perfectly smooth in the SAME frame.
   `rosetteDist` was rewritten to the same technique (FA #65/#73 — adopt a working reference
   verbatim rather than keep patching a different one) at 150 segments, chosen empirically:
   segment counts as low as 70-110 still showed visible faceting on the same test loop, while 150
   and 600 were pixel-identical at the same extreme zoom — 150 is past the point of diminishing
   return, not under it.

2. **A previously-invisible 150 ms/frame regression** (`PresetFrameBudgetTests`: 14.8x the median
   preset, over the 60 ms absolute ceiling), uncovered only once the full engine suite was run
   against the completed conversion. The dense polyline search ran on every ray-march step of
   every pixel, including the ~90% of the 1080p frame that is empty background far from the small
   (~0.3-radius) figure. Fixed with a bounding-sphere SDF lower bound: the curve's own magnitude
   identity (`|z1+a*z2| <= |z1|+a|z2| = 1+a`, divided by the curve's own `(1+a)` normalizer) proves
   the whole tube lies within a sphere of exactly `kRosetteRadius + tubeRadius`, centered at the
   origin — a mathematically exact, not approximate, bound. The same bound was added to the wing
   tubes (their arc's own endpoints sit at a known fixed radius from a known center), since the
   figure bound alone only partially closed the gap. **Found live within that fix:** a bare
   `boundD > 0` cutoff is unsound, not just imprecise — the bounding sphere is TANGENT to the true
   surface at specific points (the curve reaches exactly its bounding radius at `t=0`, for every
   morph state), so the cheap branch can return a near-zero value there, and the ray-march loop's
   relative hit epsilon (`d < 0.001*t`) reads any near-zero SDF as a genuine surface hit — this
   rendered a false, audio-INDEPENDENT sphere silhouette that swallowed every aMorph/rotation/
   symmetry difference `RosetteRayMarchTests` measures (caught because those three coupling tests
   collapsed to near-zero diffs, not because the render looked visibly wrong at a glance). Fixed
   with a safety margin (0.03, ~15x the hit epsilon at this scene's camera distance) between the
   bounding radius and where the cheap branch is trusted — only a thin shell around the true
   boundary falls through to the exact search. Final measured cost: 28 ms/frame at 1080p (4.8x
   the median preset), comfortable margin under both gates.

### Also found and fixed in the same increment

`SessionReplayHarness` never mapped the TONAL block (`tonalPhaseFifths`/`tonalConsonance`/
`harmonicFlux`/`midAttRel`) for any ray-march preset — Rosette is the first ray-march preset
routed off it, and `ReplayHarnessRouteCoverageTests` (built exactly to catch this class of gap)
correctly flagged it the moment the route existed. Mapped from the real CSV columns
`AudioRoutePrimitives.swift` already names (`tonal_phase_fifths`, `tonal_consonance`,
`harmonic_flux`, `mid_att_rel`) — the columns were always written by `SessionRecorder+CSV.swift`,
just never read on the replay side. `Rosette.json`'s `rubric_profile` was briefly (incorrectly)
set to `full` mid-session on the theory that real materials now warranted the full cascade rubric
— reverted to `lightweight` once `FidelityRubricTests` showed the `full` profile's checks
(triplanar textures, detail normal maps, volumetric fog motes, parallax occlusion, chroma thin-
film) are built for painterly/terrain-style ray-march presets and do not conceptually apply to a
deliberately spare line-art emblem; Rosette's visual language was never meant to need them.

### Verification

Full `RosetteRayMarchTests` suite (non-degenerate render, harmony/rotation/symmetry coupling,
BUG-104 continuity re-verified under the new distance search) green. `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests`
green with real measured motion (Δ0.010, 0.00 flashes/s) after extending
`FlashHarnessSupport.withHarmonicMotion` with an optional consonance sweep — Rosette's dominant
visual dimension (`aMorph`, the swept tube's shape) is gated by `tonalConsonance`, which the
existing decorator (built for Witchlight's rotation-only response) pinned at a constant, leaving
the geometry frozen. `PresetAcceptanceTests`' Rosette-specific black-stub exemptions (dating from
the old `direct+mv_warp` `rosette_fragment` stub) removed — Rosette now passes both checks through
the genuine ray-march path, same as the other three ray-march presets. Full engine suite (1903
tests) green; `swiftlint --strict` clean (one pre-existing function-length/identifier-name
violation in `RayMarchPipeline+MetalFX.swift`, introduced by this increment's camera-orbit code,
fixed by extracting `applyCameraOrbit` as its own function).

**References.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Increment WHIT.2b; `Rosette.metal`; `Rosette.json`;
`RosetteRayMarchTests.swift`; D-220/D-221 (the state and transition mechanism this renders);
D-021 (the `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` ray-march contract this preset now uses).

## D-223: Rosette's camera orbit removed (WHIT.2c)

**Status:** Accepted. `certified: false` unchanged.

### What was gated

Immediately after D-222 shipped and was rebuilt for a live look, Matt: *"I hate it. It's just a
few objects rotating 360 degrees and moving poorly with the music. Movement of the patterns is
minimal and feels completely disconnected from the music. I dislike the rotation and hate the way
the pattern moves."* He attached a real session folder (`features.csv`/`stems.csv`/`session.log`)
from the live look.

### The diagnosis, before any fix was attempted

Per this codebase's diagnose-first discipline, the session data was read before touching code:

1. **The orbit itself is 100% audio-independent.** `scene_orbit_speed=0.12` (D-222) advances the
   camera angle at a fixed rate every frame regardless of the music — the single most visually
   dominant motion in the scene (it moves the ENTIRE composition, not a subtle local change) had
   no coupling to anything in the session. This alone is a strong candidate for "moving poorly
   with the music" / "completely disconnected from the music."
2. **Replaying Matt's actual session through the real render path** (`SessionReplayHarness`,
   `REPLAY_SESSION=<his session dir>`) surfaced a second, independent failure mode: because the
   figure and both wing-arc tubes all lie flat in the z=0 plane, the orbit periodically points the
   camera near edge-on to the WHOLE scene simultaneously — every element, not just one. Stills
   pulled at several timestamps across his session showed the composition flattened to a plain
   ring plus two thin lines, even at moments where the underlying curve (per that same session's
   `tonal_consonance`/`harmonic_flux` values) was not actually that simple. The orbit was not
   merely failing to help — it was periodically hiding real geometric complexity behind a bad
   viewing angle.
3. A third, SEPARATE finding surfaced by the same data pull, explicitly NOT addressed by this
   decision: `tonal_consonance` on this specific track averages 0.071 against the shader's
   corpus-calibrated median of 0.117 and p99 of 0.32 (`Rosette.metal`'s `rosetteMorphState`
   comment cites TONAL.2b's 1000-track calibration) — 84% of frames sit below the point where the
   `presence` smoothstep gate even reaches half-weight, meaning the audio-independent floor-drift
   clock dominates the figure's tightness for most of the track, not the harmony signal. This is a
   real, evidenced gap, but it is a tightness-CALIBRATION question distinct from the orbit, and
   Matt had not yet weighed in on it when this decision was made — presented to him separately,
   not folded into this fix.

### Decision

`scene_orbit_speed` removed from `Rosette.json` — the field is simply absent, so
`PresetDescriptor.sceneOrbitSpeed` decodes to its default `0` (camera-static) and the camera holds
the fixed position `[1.15, 1.0, -1.9]` already visually verified against the WHIT.2b jaggedness
and performance fixes (§D-222). **The generic `scene_orbit_speed` engine feature is NOT deleted.**
It is cheap, fully generic camera plumbing that mirrors the already-retained `scene_dolly_speed`
pattern (D-020-era precedent: a capability kept at low-or-zero live consumers because the cost is
optionality only, e.g. RMENV.1's multi-light rig, D-213). The failure diagnosed here is specific to
Rosette's use of it — a constant, unmodulated rate applied to a scene with no out-of-plane
geometry — not a defect in the orbit mechanism itself. A future preset with real 3D depth
variation, or an audio-modulated orbit rate (direction/speed keyed off arousal or the bar, an
option offered to Matt and not yet decided), remains a live option for this capability.

### Verification

Full `RosetteRayMarchTests` suite, `PresetFrameBudgetTests`, and
`MultiPassFlashHarnessTests.rosetteIsFlashSafe` re-run green with the orbit removed (flash-safety
measurement drops slightly, Δ0.010→Δ0.008, since the orbit had been contributing some of the
measured frame-to-frame luma variation — still comfortably above the 0.003 responsiveness floor
and still 0.00 flashes/s / SAFE).

**References.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Increment WHIT.2c; `Rosette.json`; D-222 (the orbit
this removes); `docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md` §6.10.

## D-224: Rosette retired (WHIT-RETIRE.1)

**Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, 2026-08-26).

**Decision.** Rosette is retired in its entirety. All preset code (`Rosette.metal`,
`Rosette.json`, `Sources/Presets/Rosette/RosetteState.swift`), its dedicated tests
(`RosetteRayMarchTests.swift`, `RosetteStateTests.swift`), its design doc
(`docs/presets/ROSETTE_DESIGN.md`), and its visual reference set
(`docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/rosette/`) are deleted. `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest.
expectedProductionPresetCount` drops **30 → 29**. Recover from git history if a future concept
revives it — `git log --all --oneline -- '**/Rosette*'` finds every commit.

**Context — what makes this different from Faraday (D-204) but the same shape.** Like Faraday,
Rosette did not die on an unfixed bug: the WHIT.2b ray-march conversion, the jaggedness fix, and
the WHIT.2c orbit removal were each root-caused correctly and verified working (full test suite
green, real measured flash-safety numbers, direct visual confirmation at every step). What never
moved was Matt's verdict. Six live rounds, from WHIT.0's initial look-spike through WHIT.2c's
orbit removal, each addressed the SPECIFIC defect raised in that round — and each time, the next
live look found a new specific defect rather than approval. The final round made this explicit:
offered a bounded, two-item fix (recompose the camera so the epicycle reads as the hero rather
than the wing arcs; recalibrate `figure_tightness <- tonalConsonance` against real track data,
since the shader's assumed corpus range didn't match observed sessions) as an alternative to
retirement. Matt: *"Even a harness difference will not be enough to save this preset, I'm
afraid."* That is a statement about the CONCEPT's ceiling, not about any specific remaining bug —
the same category as D-201's motion-incoherence ceiling and D-204's "a correct mapping cannot
rescue an intrinsically low-energy image," not the KS/Truchet/Kleinian Froth
reference-vs-mechanism misses.

**What survives.** The ray-march / PBR / IBL / SSGI pipeline itself (`RayMarchPipeline`,
`RayMarch.metal`, `IBL.metal`, `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms`) is untouched — Volumetric
Lithograph, Lumen Mosaic, and Ferrofluid Ocean all still run on it. The generic camera-orbit
feature (`scene_orbit_speed`, `RayMarchPipeline.cameraOrbitSpeed`/`cameraOrbitAngle`,
`applyCameraOrbit`) is KEPT, per the same reasoning D-223 already gave and the RMENV/D-188
zero-consumer-capability precedent: it is cheap, generic scalar plumbing, and the failure
diagnosed was Rosette's specific use of it (constant rate, wholly planar scene), not the
mechanism. It currently has zero consumers, same as RMENV after Kinetic Sculpture's retirement,
and awaits a future preset the same way.

**What does NOT survive, and why this is a different call than the orbit.** The
`RosetteUniforms` ray-march buffer-6 ABI parameter (D-220/WHIT.2b) — `smoothedFifths`/`symmetryN`,
threaded as a mandatory trailing parameter through `sceneSDF`/`sceneMaterial` in the shared
preamble AND all three other ray-march presets (each silencing it via `(void)rosette;`) — is
fully removed, not kept-as-capability. Unlike `scene_orbit_speed` (a generic float scalar any
future preset can trivially reuse by name) or `LumenPatternState`/buffer 8 (kept because Lumen
Mosaic is a LIVE, currently-shipping consumer), `RosetteUniforms` was a bespoke 2-float struct
whose FIELDS encode Rosette's own specific algorithm (a circular-phase smoother and a
symmetry-order hold-timer) — renaming it away from "Rosette" would not have made it reusable, since
a future preset wanting cross-frame CPU state would need different fields anyway. Keeping a
zero-consumer, preset-shaped struct as permanent ABI weight on every ray-march preset's signature
is exactly the "reusable infrastructure" trap CLAUDE.md's Authoring Discipline warns against
(D-097 — siblings, not subclasses); a future preset can rebuild the identical pattern from git
history (this decision, or D-220) in about the time it took to build originally. The matching
`presetFragmentBuffer1` Swift-side plumbing (`RayMarchPipeline.render`, `runGBufferPass`,
`rosettePlaceholderBuffer`) and the `varyConsonance`/`consonanceSweep` flash-harness parameters
(added at WHIT.2b/D-222 specifically for Rosette's flash-safety measurement, zero other callers)
are removed for the same reason.

**Phase WHIT is NOT closed.** `docs/presets/WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` is the program-level doc governing
three sibling presets after John Whitney Sr.: Rosette (WHIT.A, built through WHIT.2c, retired by
this decision), Frieze (WHIT.B, unstarted), and Unison (WHIT.C, unstarted) — explicitly "three
different Whitney mechanisms, not one engine with three configs" (D-097 cited in that doc). This
decision retires only WHIT.A/Rosette; Frieze and Unison remain open future work under the same
program, unaffected by Rosette's specific concept not landing. `WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` is annotated
to mark WHIT.A retired with a pointer here, not deleted.

**Wiring removed.** `expectedProductionPresetCount` 30 → 29; `FidelityRubricTests.
expectedAutomatedGate` Rosette entry removed; `MultiPassRenderHarness`'s `renderRosette` method +
its `"Rosette"` dispatch case + its ray-march-preset-name-set entry removed;
`MultiPassFlashHarnessTests.rosetteIsFlashSafe` removed; `StatefulRuntimeRegistry.
knownPresetNames`'s `"Rosette"` entry removed (`ParticleGeometryRegistry.swift`);
`VisualizerEngine`'s `rosetteState` property + `bindRosetteRuntime` + its dispatch case + its
track-change reset + its teardown nil-out all removed (`VisualizerEngine.swift`,
`VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`). Comments in `PresetDescriptor.swift`, `RayMarchPipeline+
MetalFX.swift`, `SessionReplayHarness.swift`, and `ReplayHarnessRouteCoverageTests.swift` that
named Rosette as a still-live consumer of `scene_orbit_speed` or the TONAL-block CSV mapping are
reworded to reflect retirement while the underlying generic capabilities stay documented and
available.

**Carry-forward.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (Phase WHIT header annotated, WHIT-RETIRE.1
Recently-Completed entry), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Module Map entries removed, GPU Contract
Details buffer-6 section reverted to its pre-WHIT.2b text), `docs/ENGINE/RENDER_CAPABILITY_
REGISTRY.md` and `docs/SHADER_CRAFT.md` (`scene_orbit_speed` rows updated to note zero consumers,
Rosette retired), `docs/presets/WHITNEY_PROGRAM.md` (WHIT.A marked retired). D-217 through D-223
(Rosette's full decision history) are kept in place as historical record, per the D-188 precedent
— superseded, not deleted.

**References.** `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Increment WHIT-RETIRE.1; D-217–D-223 (Rosette's full
decision history, all superseded by this one); D-188 / D-201 / D-204 (the retirement precedents
this follows); D-097 (siblings not subclasses — why `RosetteUniforms` does not survive as
"reusable infrastructure").

## D-225: Phosphene renamed to Uzume — external identity (RN.1)

**Status:** Accepted (Matt's call; name decided 2026-08-09, executed 2026-08-31).

**Decision.** The product is **Uzume** (oo-ZOO-meh) — Ame-no-Uzume, the kami whose planned,
drummed performance drew the sun back out of the cave. RN.1 renames every surface a user or
macOS sees. Internal module, target, scheme, package and directory names stay `Uzume*`;
that is RN.2.

| Built product | `Uzume.app` | `Uzume.app` |
| Swift module | `UzumeApp` | `UzumeApp` (pinned — RN.2) |
| URL scheme | `uzume://` | `uzume://` |
| OAuth URL name | `com.phosphene.spotify-oauth` | `io.uzume.spotify-oauth` |
| Logger subsystems | `com.phosphene.*` | `io.uzume.*` |
| Keychain service | `com.phosphene.spotify` | `io.uzume.spotify` |
| Application Support | `Uzume/` | `Uzume/` |
| Repo | `hoaxpoet/uzume` | `hoaxpoet/uzume` |

**Why `io.uzume`, not `app.uzume`.** Reverse-DNS convention is that the prefix reflects a domain
you control. uzume.com is an active taiko ensemble and uzume.app is a parked third-party
registration; uzume.io was verified unregistered and is the one Matt is taking. Baking a
namespace you do not own into the Keychain, the preferences domain and the TCC identity is a
liability that costs nothing to avoid at this stage and is expensive to undo later.

**Why the product renames but the module does not.** `CFBundleName` drives the macOS app menu
and is injected from `PRODUCT_NAME`; setting it in `Info.plist` or via `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` was
verified to have no effect. So `PRODUCT_NAME = Uzume` is required for the menu bar to read
Uzume — but it also renames the Swift module, which breaks every
`@testable import PhospheneApp`. `PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME = PhospheneApp` splits the two, letting
the visible rename land now and the module rename wait for RN.2 with the rest of the tree.

**State policy — what migrates and what does not.**

*Migrated, idempotently, by `IdentityMigrator` at launch:* the UserDefaults domain and the
`Application Support` tree. The latter matters — the stem cache is hundreds of MB and every
entry cost an ML stem-separation pass. Values already set under the new identity always win, so
a current preference is never clobbered by a stale one. Failures are logged and swallowed: a
stranded cache costs recomputation, not correctness.

*Not migrated — TCC grants.* Screen Recording, Apple Events and Apple Music are keyed to the
bundle ID by the OS. There is no API to transfer them; the old grant is orphaned and the user
re-grants once. Documented in RUNBOOK §"After the Uzume rename".

*Not migrated — the Spotify refresh token.* This was implemented and **reverted**, and the
reversal is the load-bearing part of this decision. Reading an item written by a different code
identity makes securityd raise a modal `SecurityAgent` authorization prompt, and
`SecItemCopyMatching` blocks until it is answered. `SpotifyKeychainStore` is constructed from a
stored-property initializer on the `App` struct, which runs *before* `init()`'s body — so the
adoption froze app launch outright, and with it the XCTest runner, which could never establish
its connection. Diagnosed by `sample`-ing the wedged process; the stack named
`loadRefreshToken → SecItemCopyMatching → CSSM_DecryptDataFinal → mach_msg` directly. Silent
cross-identity adoption needs a shared keychain-access-group, a signing change well outside this
increment. One OAuth reconnect beats a modal dialog on every cold start.

**Frozen history keeps the old name.** `DECISIONS_HISTORY`, dated release-note entries,
resolved `KNOWN_ISSUES` records, `docs/diagnostics/`, `prompts/` and the naming report are
untouched — they record what was true at their date. Only operational docs, where a
`com.phosphene` string is a command someone runs, were swept.

## D-226: The permission card requests capture access itself (BUG111.1)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-31 · Supersedes the U.2 key decision "Preflight + URL scheme, NOT `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`."

**The loop.** macOS adds an app to Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording only after
that app has called `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`. Until U.2, the only call site was
`VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift:56`, on the `startAudio()` path. `ContentView`'s permission gate
sits above the session-state switch (UX_SPEC §3.1 — "regardless of session state"), so on a machine
with no grant the card is the only reachable UI. Its one action deep-linked to a pane that did not
list the app. Nothing to toggle, no other screen to reach, and the code that would have registered
the app was behind the gate. The only escape was adding the `.app` bundle by hand with the pane's
"+" button, which no real user finds.

**Why it stayed latent for four months.** The state requires *never having granted*. The dev machine
granted once under `com.phosphene.app` in April and every subsequent build inherited it. RN.1's
bundle-ID change to `io.uzume.mac` orphaned that grant and produced the first genuine first-run since
U.2. A fresh install and `tccutil reset ScreenCapture` reach the same place.

**U.2's rationale was locally true.** "The request API's system dialog doesn't compose with 'Open
System Settings and return'" describes the *revoke-and-re-grant* flow the spec was written around —
where the app is already listed, the dialog is suppressed, and the deep link works. It generalised
silently to a case it had never been tested against. (The comment's provenance was checked against
`63908e94`, U.2, 2026-04-22 — not the U.11 OAuth work, as a later reading assumed.)

**The fix, and why it is stateless.** The primary CTA calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`; the
deep link becomes a secondary link. The tempting alternative was a `hasRequested` flag that shows the
dialog on the first press and Settings thereafter — but there is no queryable "not determined" state
for screen capture, so that flag is a guess about TCC that can go stale (a reset, a re-signed build,
a restored `UserDefaults`), and a wrong guess reproduces this bug. Showing both controls always is
strictly smaller and correct in every TCC state.

**`SystemScreenCapturePermissionProvider` is untouched.** It still never prompts. That was the part
of U.2's rule worth keeping: the provider is the passive probe `PermissionMonitor` polls on
`didBecomeActive`, and a probe that prompts would fire a dialog on every foreground. The prompt
belongs to a button press, not to a status check.

**Rejected: reword the card to tell the user to start a session.** Starting a session is exactly what
the gate prevents.

permission card self-healing rather than a set of manual steps).

## D-227: Internal tree renamed to Uzume; runtime string identity left behind (RN.2)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-31 · Executes D-225's RN.2 recommendation.

**What moved.** `PhospheneApp/` → `UzumeApp/`, `PhospheneAppTests/` → `UzumeAppTests/`,
`PhospheneEngine/` → `UzumeEngine/`, `PhospheneTools/` → `UzumeTools/`,
`PhospheneApp.xcodeproj` → `UzumeApp.xcodeproj`, `Phosphene.xcconfig` → `Uzume.xcconfig`
(and `Phosphene.local.xcconfig` → `Uzume.local.xcconfig`), the `PhospheneApp`/`PhospheneAppTests`
targets and scheme, the `PhospheneEngine`/`PhospheneTools` packages and the `PhospheneEngine`
library product, the `PhospheneEngineTests` test target, `PhospheneToast` → `UzumeToast`,
every `PHOSPHENE_*` env var → `UZUME_*`, and the accessibility identifiers.
The generic modules — `Audio`, `DSP`, `ML`, `Renderer`, `Presets`, `Orchestrator`, `Session`,
`Shared`, `Diagnostics` — are unchanged; they were never branded.

**The module, not unpinned but repointed.** D-225 pinned `PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME = PhospheneApp`
precisely so RN.1 could ship the visible rename alone. The obvious RN.2 move is to delete the pin
and let the module follow `PRODUCT_NAME` — but `PRODUCT_NAME` is `Uzume` (it drives `CFBundleName`
and the menu bar), so deleting the pin yields a module named `Uzume` inside a target named
`UzumeApp`. Repointing the pin to `UzumeApp` keeps module, target, and directory all one name and
leaves the shipped bundle untouched. `TEST_HOST` and all 30+ `@testable import` sites move in the
same commit, as D-225 warned they must.

**What deliberately did not move, and why.**

*Persisted `UserDefaults` keys.* The `phosphene.settings.<group>.<key>` scheme, plus
`phosphene.lf.recents`, `phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged` and
`phosphene.cache.localFile.maxBytes`, are live user state. Renaming them resets every setting on
every existing install unless paired with `SettingsMigrator` entries — that is a state migration,
not a structural rename, and it carries RN.1's trap-2 class of risk. The scheme name is now a
historical artifact of the old brand; that is a cosmetic cost paid to avoid a real one.

*On-disk output paths.* `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/` holds every session capture Matt has
recorded, and roughly 250 documented diagnostic invocations across the repo resolve against it.
The same applies to `~/uzume_features.csv`, `~/uzume_diag.log`,
`~/uzume_beatbench_fixtures/`, `~/Documents/uzume_soak/` and `/tmp/uzume_visual/`.
Renaming these orphans existing evidence and is **user-visible**, which makes it Matt's call rather
than Claude's. Deferred to RN.3 as an explicit DECISION-NEEDED.

*Legacy identity constants.* `IdentityMigrator.legacyBundleID` (`com.phosphene.app`),
`legacyAppSupportDirName` (`Phosphene`) and `SpotifyKeychainStore`'s `com.phosphene.spotify`
reference are the RN.1 migration itself. They are removable only when D-225's migration window
closes — see §Compatibility aliases in the RN.2 closeout.

*Shader comments and preset sidecars.* Eleven `.metal` files and five preset `.json` descriptions
carry brand prose. RN.2's constraint set forbids editing shaders or presets; the sweep honored it.
Batched to RN.3 behind the `preset-session` skill.

**The falsification hazard, discovered the hard way.** A blanket prose replace of
Phosphene → Uzume corrupted history three separate times before it was caught: `docs/planning/`
(RN.0's preserved naming evidence — it produced "the Uzume → Uzume rename", "another open-source
macOS app named Uzume", "uzumes are all entoptic phenomena", and a rewritten **third-party** URL,
`kagerou.glass/phosphene`); five verbatim quotations, two attributed to Matt by name; and the
rename narrative in D-225, the Phase RN heading, and a RUNBOOK warning whose meaning **inverted**
(it began citing the current app name as the stale one). The durable rule: **a sweep may rewrite
paths, commands and identifiers anywhere, but never the inside of a quotation, a third-party
proper noun, or a sentence that narrates the rename.** "Phosphene" is also a common noun; a
brand sweep on a dictionary word needs a scan for the phenomenon sense before it is trusted.
The mechanical check that catches all three classes: grep for `Uzume → Uzume`, `renamed to Uzume`
adjacent to `Uzume`, and any plural/lowercase `uzume` in prose.

**Verification.** Clean `git archive` export of the tracked tree: `xcodebuild -list` shows targets
`UzumeApp`/`UzumeAppTests` and schemes `UzumeApp`/`UzumeEngine`; both packages resolve and build.
Built products confirmed as `Uzume.app` / executable `Uzume` / `UzumeAppTests.xctest` /
`UzumeApp.swiftmodule`. Every `PBXFileReference` path resolves (the only misses are SDK
frameworks, which are `SDKROOT`-relative by design). `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh`: engine 1873
tests, app 426 tests, SwiftLint 0 violations in 518 files, doc gates 13/13 — ALL GREEN.

## D-228: uzume-site is the brand source of truth; the app owns product facts (RN.3)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-31 · Companion to [D-227] (RN.2).

**The boundary.** Two repositories were both describing Uzume and neither said which
one was authoritative, so each had drifted into asserting things the other could
disprove. The split is now explicit, and it is drawn on *verifiability*:

| `hoaxpoet/uzume-site` owns | `hoaxpoet/uzume` owns |
|---|---|
| Brand story, voice, palette, typography (`BRAND.md`) | Product behaviour + UX contract (`PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `UX_SPEC.md`) |
| The First Opening design system (`DESIGN.md`, `DesignSystem/`) | Engineering decisions (`DECISIONS.md`) |
| Production identity assets (`brand/`) | Build/test/contributor commands |
| Naming research + website planning (`docs/planning/`) | Preset authoring and certification |
| Public marketing copy | **Whether a claim is true of the shipped build** |

The app repo does not redesign brand; the site repo does not assert product facts.

**`docs/planning/` here is frozen.** RN.0 copied the three planning documents in as
rename evidence, and RN.2 restored them verbatim after a sweep falsified them. They
now carry an explicit snapshot header naming the site's copies as live. They had
diverged **in both directions** — this repo's copy held the registrar-corrected
domain facts, the site's held the newer retirement of the AI framing — so RN.3
merged rather than overwrote, and only the site's copies continue.

**The two corrections that came back to this repo.**

*The README explained the wrong word.* Its second paragraph read "The name references
the phenomenon of perceiving light and patterns without external visual stimulus" —
a correct gloss of **phosphene**, left attached to the name **Uzume** by RN.2's sweep.
It is the sharpest instance of D-227's dictionary-word hazard and a **new variant**:
the sentence contains no `Phosphene` token at all, so no lexical residual scan could
find it. Only reading the prose for meaning catches a **semantic orphan** — a
sentence whose subject was renamed out from under it. Replaced with the Ame-no-Uzume
story as `BRAND.md` tells it.

*"AI orchestrator" is not a product claim.* The site retired that framing on the
grounds that the session planner is deterministic and rules-based ([D-034], and
[D-170]'s "★ Premise correction" is about ML for *analysis*, not planning); ML does
stem separation, beat tracking and mood classification, none of which plan anything.
README and CLAUDE.md both still led with it. Now: "a deterministic session planner
sequences the whole visual session … machine learning does the listening; the
planning is rules-based and reproducible."

**The icon is traceable, and now says so.** All ten PNGs in
`UzumeApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` are byte-identical (SHA-256) to
`uzume-site`'s `brand/icon/Uzume.iconset/` — no re-export between the approved
master and the shipped bundle. Recorded in `docs/CREDITS.md` with the re-verification
command, and in the site's `ARTIFACTS.md` with the digests.

**Two stale contributor instructions fixed on the way through.** The README told a
new contributor to install `git-lfs` **before cloning** or get stub files — nothing
has been LFS-tracked since [D-211] (`git lfs ls-files` returns zero), so the warning
sent people down a wrong path on first contact. `PUBLISHING.md` §Decisions likewise
still said "LFS keeps reference media only."

**What RN.3 deliberately did not do.** It did not build website architecture that
does not exist: there is no Astro app, no marketing pages, no OG/manifest surface, so
none was invented. The design system's "Download the beta" specimens stay — they are
component placeholders, and `catalogue.js` already models the honest unavailable
state ("A signed and notarized build has not been published yet"). Public wording for
an unreleased app is Matt's call, not a mechanical fix; the closeout lists what needs
his pick.

## D-229: The pre-publication history rewrite is retired, not deferred (RN.4)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-31 · Retires `PUBLISHING.md` §2. Supersedes the
2026-07-12 "CONFIRMED: run once, before first publish" decision.

**What the original decision rested on.** §2 says it plainly: *"pre-publication is the
one moment a rewrite is free (no external clones exist)."* Matt had already declined a
size-only rewrite in June 2026 as not worth breaking clones for ~35 MiB; publication was
what changed the calculus. That window is the whole argument — and the repo went public
without the rewrite running, so the window shut. This is not "we still owe it"; the
condition that made it cheap no longer holds.

**The payload, measured.** `git log --format='%ae' | sort | uniq -c`:

| Identity | Commits | What it actually exposes |
|---|---|---|
| `braesidebandit@Matthews-Mac-mini.local` | 1684 | **Not a routable address.** `.local` is non-routable mDNS — it cannot receive mail. Leaks a macOS username and a machine name. |
| `matt@plaitandpattern.com` | 183 | A **business** address already published on plaitandpattern.com (HTTP 200). |
| `253968857+hoaxpoet@users.noreply.github.com` | 1051 | By design. |

**The cost, measured.** A rewrite would:

1. **Invalidate 30 commit SHAs cited in the doc corpus** — DECISIONS, ENGINEERING_PLAN,
   KNOWN_ISSUES and the release notes reference specific commits as evidence. Rewriting
   turns every one into a dead reference, which damages the thing the docs exist for.
2. Break all 11 local worktrees plus the Codex clone — each needs re-cloning, and RN.3
   already showed how much gitignored state (weights, fixtures, `Uzume.local.xcconfig`)
   does not survive a naive re-clone.
3. Require temporarily disabling `main`'s branch protection to force-push. CLAUDE.md
   treats bypassing that protection as a **stop signal**, and doing it deliberately to
   land a rewrite is exactly the shape that rule exists to prevent.

Forks are currently 0, so the usual "forks retain the objects" argument does not apply —
but the repo is public, clones are unmeasurable, and GitHub retains unreferenced objects
server-side regardless. A rewrite would not undo exposure that has already occurred.

**What was fixed instead, without touching history.** The sharpest item §2 named was
`matt.deming@gmail.com`. It turned out to be **in the current tree, not just history** —
and in an ironic place: PUB.1's privacy sweep redacted the address, then its own changelog
entry named it (`ENGINEERING_PLAN_HISTORY.md`), and §2's filter-repo recipe quoted it twice
more. Those are live-tree occurrences fixable with an ordinary edit, and they are fixed.
`user.email` is already the GitHub noreply, so no new commit adds exposure.

**What would reopen this.** A real credential or secret found in history — not an email
address. That is a different decision with a different cost/benefit, and it would be worth
the clone breakage. Nothing found in the RN.4 scan meets that bar (`uzume-site` was scanned
the same way before it was made public: no key patterns, no secret files).

**References.** `docs/PUBLISHING.md` §2 (retained as the record, marked do-not-run);

## D-232: Vendored design tokens, and Uzume is always dark (DS.1)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-09-01 · Step 1 of the seven-step migration order in
`uzume-site`'s `PHOSPHENE-COMPONENT-CENSUS.md` §Migration order.

**Why vendoring, not a package dependency.** [D-228] gives `uzume-site` the design
system. The obvious adoption route — add `DesignSystem/SwiftUI` as a local-path or git
Swift package dependency — fails on the thing the app cannot compromise: a fresh clone
and CI must build with one repo. A local path reference breaks the moment the sibling is
not there; a git dependency puts a second repo's availability in front of every build of
the product. Vendoring keeps the app self-contained.

**What vendoring costs, and where that cost is paid.** A copy goes stale silently. The
whole point of `Scripts/check_design_token_drift.sh` is to make it not silent:

- The vendored body is hashed and compared against the SHA-256 in its own provenance
  header. This runs everywhere, including a fresh clone, and catches an edit to the copy.
- The upstream file is hashed and compared against the same value, but only when a
  sibling `uzume-site` checkout is present. Absent sibling prints `SKIP` and exits 0, so
  the check never becomes a reason CI or a new contributor is red.

Re-syncing is manual. That is the accepted price. Tokens move about once per design
increment, and the alternative — a build-time fetch — reintroduces exactly the second-repo
dependency vendoring exists to avoid.

**App-only roles never enter the vendored file.** Adding a role there would make the
provenance claim false and fail the drift check on the next run, which is the intended
behaviour, not an obstacle. `UzumeTokens+App.swift` is the one place they live, and every
value carries the `--color-*` name it came from so a reviewer can trace any app colour
back to a line of `tokens.css` with one grep.

**Always dark (Matt's choice A).** The alternatives were B (chrome adapts, the performance
does not) and C (everything adapts). A wins on two counts. It is what the app already does
— every chrome surface is drawn on an unconditional near-black canvas — so DS.1 stays a
presentation swap with one appearance to screenshot. And the ≥4.5:1 contrast floor behind
`PerformanceBackdrop` was measured against a dark composite; C would re-open that
measurement as a side effect of a token adoption, which is the wrong increment to do it in.
The principle underneath: the frame stays dark so the performance is the only bright thing.

Implementation is two parts. `UzumeAppColor` transcribes the DARK block of `tokens.css`
rather than consuming the vendored `UzumeColor`'s adaptive roles, and the app root sets
`.preferredColorScheme(.dark)` so the native controls composed beside those roles resolve
against the same palette instead of turning light on a Light-Mode Mac. Light-appearance
support stays open as its own increment; the divergence is written up in
`docs/reviews/DS.1/UPSTREAM-FINDINGS.md` so B remains available.

**Two upstream disagreements, recorded not patched.** The app reads `tokens.css` where it
and the Swift package differ, and reports the difference upward rather than editing the
vendored file:

- `UzumeColor.canvas` is `.windowBackgroundColor`, `surface` is `.controlBackgroundColor`.
  In dark appearance these resolve far lighter than `--color-canvas` #0b0c10 /
  `--color-surface` #14151a. The package's system-colour mapping produces neither the
  light nor the dark published palette.
- `UzumeRadius` is 6 / 10 / 14; `--radius-sm/md/lg` are 6 / 12 / 16. Only the smallest
  rung agrees. `UzumeAppRadius` follows `tokens.css`; `UzumeRadius.standard` (10) is used
  directly where a measured value depends on it, which is `PerformanceBackdrop`'s corner.

**What DS.1 did not touch.** `DashboardTokens` keeps its retired purple/coral palette, its
telemetry-dense type scale, and all four of its consumers — the census's own finding is
that developer instrumentation is a separate system. The package's prototype components
(`CuratorControlSurface`, `StreamingHandoff`, `PreparationStage`, `PerformancePreflight`,
`UzumeSystemNotice`) are not adopted; its own README calls them sketches, and
`CuratorControlSurface` is explicitly not the migration target.

## D-233: One tile component carries four source affordances (DS.2)

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Status:** Accepted · **Phase:** DS — Design system adoption

### Context

`PHOSPHENE-COMPONENT-CENSUS.md` §Reusable product components lists the two tiles
as a consolidation candidate, and §Migration order makes it step 2 — the first DS
step that changes composition rather than colour, and deliberately the smallest
such change available.

The duplication was real but not total. Both tiles drew an SF Symbol, a headline
title and a caption subtitle in a rounded surface, and both announced the same
`"Title. Subtitle."` label. They differed in three ways: the connector tile had a
chevron, a disabled state with an alternate caption and an optional secondary
button, and a VoiceOver hint; the local tile had a hover state and no hint.

### Decision

One component, `SourceChoice`, carrying four affordances:

| Affordance | Trailing | Hover | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.navigation` | chevron | yes | the three enabled connector tiles |
| `.action(() -> Void)` | none | yes | the three local source tiles |
| `.unavailable(reason:recovery: nil)` | none | no | — (available, unused today) |
| `.unavailable(reason:recovery:)` | recovery button | no | Apple Music when Music.app is not running |

**The component never constructs a `NavigationLink`.** `.navigation` renders the
chevron and the interactive treatment; the consumer wraps the tile. This is the
load-bearing half of the decision: it is what keeps `connectorPath` owned by
`ConnectorPickerViewModel` and keeps `AppleMusicConnectionWrapper` /
`OAuthSpotifyConnectionWrapper` holding their view models for their full
lifetimes. CA.6-FU-3 exists because rebuilding those view models orphans
in-flight OAuth and auto-retry Tasks; a component that owned navigation would
have put that back at risk.

`ConnectorType` was not touched. Title, subtitle and symbol are product content
and stay on the enum, read at the construction site and handed in.

### Consequences

Two behaviour changes, each the direct consequence of one component replacing two:

1. **The connector tiles gain hover feedback.** They had none; the local tiles
   did. Sharing one interactive treatment means the connector tiles now light on
   hover exactly as the local ones always have.
2. **The local tiles gain a VoiceOver hint.** The connector tiles announced
   "Connect using this source" / "Not available"; the local tiles announced
   nothing after their label. A Curator using VoiceOver got guidance on the first
   source screen and silence on the second. `SourceChoice` carries a hint for
   every affordance, and the action variant announces `"Opens a file chooser"`
   — the one new user-facing string this increment adds.

The alternative — preserving today's inconsistency inside a shared component —
was rejected: it bakes the gap into the place it is hardest to notice and
easiest to copy forward. Dropping hints everywhere was rejected because it
removes information U.9 deliberately added.

`AccessibilityLabels.connectorTileLabel(type:isEnabled:disabledCaption:)` and
`connectorTileHint(isEnabled:)` were `ConnectorType`-shaped and could not serve a
generic tile. They are replaced by `sourceChoiceLabel(title:detail:)` and
`sourceChoiceHint(_:)`, which produce byte-identical strings. The one path lost
is the old label's fallback for a disabled tile with no caption — `.unavailable`
takes a non-optional `reason`, so the fallback has no call site.

### Placement

`UzumeApp/Views/Components/`, not `UzumeApp/DesignSystem/`. That directory holds
the vendored token source and its app extension ([D-232]); a component authored
in the app is app-owned until `uzume-site` adopts it ([D-228]). What the app
learned building it goes upstream as a report, in
`docs/reviews/DS.2/UPSTREAM-FINDINGS.md`.

## D-242: Session preparation has a time budget — 40 tracks in 5 minutes

**Date:** 2026-09-03 · **Increment:** PREP.1 (sets the target; does not meet it) · **Status:** Accepted as a product commitment; **currently missed by ~6.7×**

### What was missing

Preparation has been measured, since LF.2 and the progressive-readiness work, only by *completeness*: did every track produce a `CachedTrackData`, how many failed, how far along is the walk. Nothing in `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `UX_SPEC.md` or `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` states how long preparation is allowed to take. The preparation screen shows elapsed time and a "credible estimate" (DESIGN.md §Preparation Stage) without there being anything for the estimate to be credible *against*.

### The observation

Matt, 2026-09-03, on a live local-file session: **a 12-track playlist of FLAC files took 10 minutes to prepare.** His words: *"this is unacceptable; processing time needs to be no more than 5 minutes for a 40 track playlist."*

| | measured | target |
|---|---|---|
| tracks | 12 | 40 |
| wall clock | 600 s | 300 s |
| **per track** | **50 s** | **7.5 s** |

### The decision

1. **The budget is 40 tracks in 5 minutes** — a 7.5 s/track ceiling — measured as wall-clock from the first preparation task starting to `SessionManager` reaching `.ready`, on the Mac mini dev target, with a **cold** persistent cache. A warm cache is a different (and much faster) path and is not what the budget governs.
2. **It applies to both sources, but the local path is where the gap is.** Streaming prepares a 30 s preview per track; the local path decodes and analyses the entire file, and does two things streaming structurally cannot — the whole-file `StemFeatureSeries` sweep (LFSTEM.1) and the `LoudnessProfile` (DYN.1c). A five-minute track is ten times the audio of a preview, so the local path is expected to be heavier; 6.7× over budget is not explained by that alone, and the outer loop in `SessionPreparer._runLocalFilePreparation` is a strictly serial `for` over URLs.
3. **The number is a target, not a diagnosis.** No per-stage timing exists for the local path. Which of hash / decode / `analyzePreview` / stem sweep / loudness / beat grid / instrument-family / cache-write dominates is **unknown**, and the serial loop's contribution is unquantified. Per the defect protocol, PREP.1 instruments and reports before any optimisation is designed or any stage is cut.
4. **Nothing is cut to hit the number until the cost of cutting it is known.** The full-file stem sweep is not a candidate for removal merely because it is the obvious suspect: LFSTEM.1/.2 exist precisely because live separation arrives ~2.5 s late, and Matt's M7 passed on that improvement. Any proposal that trades it away owes a statement of what the listener loses.

### What this does not decide

Whether the budget is met by making stages faster, by running tracks concurrently, by windowing the local analysis the way streaming already is, or by preparing fewer tracks up-front and the rest during playback (progressive readiness already exists and already lets playback start before the walk finishes — so "time to *ready*" and "time to *fully prepared*" may deserve separate budgets). PREP.1's report is what turns that into a decision.

**References.** PREP.1 (`prompts/PREP.1-prompt.md`); LFSTEM.1/.2 and DYN.1c (the two full-file analyses the local path adds); LF.2 (full-track offline pre-analysis); `SessionPreparer._runLocalFilePreparation`; `VisualizerEngine+LocalFilePlayback.swift`.


### Amendment — PREP.2, 2026-09-04 (Matt: *"do 1 and 4, pace the walk"*)

PREP.1 measured, and two of its four options were chosen. Both change what D-242 means.

**1. The budget is measured on a Release build.** The 50 s/track observation was taken on a
`-Onone` build — the only configuration ever produced in DerivedData on the dev machine — and the
identical pipeline over the identical files costs **54.4 s/track `-Onone` and 14.3 s/track `-O`**.
The 3.8× is purely build configuration, and Debug also *changes which stage looks like the
bottleneck* (pure-Swift DSP runs 24–80× slower; the MPSGraph stages barely move). A wall-clock claim
about preparation is meaningless without stating the configuration. "~6.7× over" was against Debug;
against Release it is ~2.2× over.

**2. The one budget becomes two.** *Time to `.ready`* — what the listener actually waits for — and
*time to fully prepared*, which they do not. The 300 s / 40 tracks ceiling now governs the first.
The second has no ceiling; it has a **floor**: the walk must stay ahead of playback, which it does
by a wide margin (preparation runs ~15× faster than playback).

This is not a new mechanism. Progressive readiness (D-056) has let streaming start after three
consecutive prepared tracks since Increment 6.1. **The local path simply never used it** — nothing
on it moved `progressiveReadinessLevel` off `.preparing`, and `allSessionTracks` was never
populated, so `startNow()`'s guard could not pass and the Start-now control never appeared on a
local session. PREP.2 wires the local walk to the same readiness computation and keeps `currentPlan`
in step with the identities as they resolve, so a session that starts early looks its prepared
tracks up in `StemCache` under the real `local:sha256:` identity rather than a placeholder.

**3. The walk paces itself once the music is playing.** Preparation flat out holds ~100 % duty on
the ML queue. Before playback that is right — the listener is waiting and every second counts. After
playback it buys nothing, because the walk only has to stay ahead. `SessionPreparer.pacingRate`
(default **2.0 × realtime**) idles out the remainder of each track's share of wall clock once the
session reaches `.playing`: the walk still gains a track on the listener every two tracks while
holding ~14 % ML-queue duty, an order of magnitude under flat out and near the ~7 % live-separation
load LFSTEM.2 measured at 4K as costing no frames.

**4. The plan grows with the walk, once per prepared track.** Matt, on being told the Orchestrator
would be planning from three tracks: *"Start Now should not result in a degraded session in any
way."* Two things had to be true for that, and only one of them was.

*It is true that starting early costs nothing in plan quality.* `SessionPlanner.plan` is a strictly
forward walk — a track's segments come from its own profile, the running history, the previous
track's last preset, the session clock and the seed, and **nothing looks ahead**. So a plan grown
3 → 6 → 12 by `extendPlan()` is byte-identical, every track and every segment, to the plan the
listener would have got by waiting. There is no cross-playlist arc being sacrificed because there is
no lookahead to sacrifice. Pinned by `PartialPlanTests.extendedPlanEqualsFullyPreparedPlan`, which
is also the gate that fails the day anyone gives the planner lookahead.

*It was NOT true that the plan kept up.* `extendPlan()` was triggered by `progressiveReadinessLevel`,
which has three useful values (3 consecutive ready, ≥ 50 %, 100 %). A 40-track session therefore
built its plan at track 3 and did not rebuild until track **20** — tracks 4–19 prepared, cached, and
absent from the plan, playing reactively with their data sitting ready. Harmless while `.ready`
waited for the whole walk (the plan was always built once, at the end); a real downgrade the moment
the listener can start at the prefix. The Orchestrator now extends off a new
`SessionManager.preparedTrackCount`, which moves once per prepared track.

**What this does NOT decide, and the honest gap.** PREP.1 could not measure whether the walk costs
the renderer frames — the performance-state confound in every available instrument is 2–3×, larger
than the effect (report §5b). **2.0 is chosen from arithmetic, not from a frame-time measurement
under a real playing session**, and it is a property so the follow-up can tune it against one. The
first live local session with an early start is that measurement. Option 2 (widening the LFSTEM.1
sweep's kept span, the only lever that gets *fully prepared* inside 300 s on its own) is **not**
taken: it can change what the listener sees, and it is deferred to a decision with an A/B in front
of it.

## D-241: The performance chrome is retokenized in place, and after inactivity it is gone completely (DS.6)

**Date:** 2026-09-03 · **Increment:** DS.6 · **Status:** Accepted, M7 passed (Matt decided the
inactivity question in his own words, relayed through the DS.6 prompt's §DECISION-NEEDED 2 the
same day; the other two are the prompt's defaults; live M7 on a Spotify session the same evening —
*"Looks good."*)

### What the chrome was

`PlaybackChromeView` composed the right things — track card, controls cluster, listening badge,
local transport, toasts — and DS.1 had already moved most of it onto tokens. What remained was
Phosphene's: the "still preparing" dot in `Color.teal`, the orchestrator pill in `.green` /
`.orange`, `LocalFileTransportBar` drawing its surface, border and a purple glow from
`DashboardTokens` under a header that cited `.impeccable.md` and "coral is action". After 3 s the
chrome faded to nothing — which `DESIGN.md` §Curator Control Surface forbids ("may reduce to quiet
edge controls after inactivity but cannot become undiscoverable") and which Matt, asked, chose to
keep. Two of UX_SPEC §7.2's three restore triggers (key press, track change) were never wired;
only the mouse was.

### The decision

1. **In place.** The census (§Migration order, step 6) and `COMPONENTS.md` §`PerformanceChrome`
   both rule out the package's `CuratorControlSurface` prototype; the existing composition is
   retokenized where it stands. The one failing condition of the increment — a second control
   tree — is not built.
2. **The pill goes.** "Planned" / "Reactive" told the listener how the session is structured. The
   surprise model ([D-238]) says the card may say what is playing now — title, artist, artwork,
   the preset on screen — and nothing about the shape of the plan. "Adapting" was never wired.
   `OrchestratorDisplayState` is deleted; `sessionProgress.isReactiveMode` still reaches the dots.
3. **Gone completely after inactivity — Matt's call.** *"Chrome should disappear completely
   after a brief period of inactivity so that the user can focus on the visuals. When mouse
   activity is detected or the user taps the screen, the chrome returns."* The prompt's default
   (a single End-session control left at the corner, the design system's "quiet edge controls")
   was built first, then replaced when the answer came in the same session. `overlayVisible`
   stays the two-state model it was: after 3 s nothing is on screen — no glyph, no edge control
   — and mouse movement (`PlaybackView`'s hover), a tap on the screen and any key (a local
   `leftMouseDown` / `rightMouseDown` / `keyDown` monitor the view model owns; Space excluded so
   the toggle sees the state it was pressed in) and a track change bring all of it back. Space
   still toggles. The first timer waits `ArrivalTransitionView.totalDuration` so "visible for 3 s
   on session start" begins when the arrival has faded, not under the whiteout.
4. **This deviates from the design system on purpose.** `COMPONENTS.md` §`PerformanceChrome`
   and `DESIGN.md` §Curator Control Surface say the chrome "cannot become undiscoverable".
   Matt's reading for the app: discoverability is the mouse and the tap, and a listener who has
   let the chrome go wants the picture, not a control. Recorded in
   `docs/reviews/DS.6/UPSTREAM-FINDINGS.md` as a product decision for `uzume-site` to adopt,
   not as a gap in the app. (The prompt's low-opacity-glyph default had a second problem that no
   longer matters but is worth keeping: a dimmed glyph over a bright preset cannot hold the 3:1
   icon floor, so any future "quiet edge control" must sit on the certified backdrop at full
   opacity.)
5. **Track information is the listener's to show or hide**, and it persists:
   `uzume.settings.visuals.showTrackInformation`, default true, in Settings beside the
   preparation-view preference, and in the cluster as "Show/Hide track info" — the same words
   DS.4a settled ([D-239]), an icon control with that label because a bordered text button does
   not fit a top-trailing icon cluster. Hidden means gone from the tree: the card, its artwork,
   and `TrackChangeAnimationView`'s centre announcement, which would otherwise fly the title
   across the screen at every boundary regardless.
6. **Motion is the design system's.** `UzumeAppMotion` (120 / 240 / 480 ms, exponential
   ease-out as the (0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) curve) lives app-side because the vendored tokens carry
   no motion — recorded upstream. The chrome fade, the badge, the current dot, the toast insert
   and the indicator all take the 240 ms state change (the chrome fade was 500 ms); reduced
   motion crossfades and drops the toast's slide. The ambient pulse and spinner stay: they are
   continuous by design and already removed under reduced motion, now pinned by
   `PlaybackChromeReducedMotionTests`.
7. **"Still preparing" is a status**, so it is drawn like one: `StatusTone.info` symbol and text
   on the tone's opaque field with its border ([D-234]) — never a colour of its own, and opaque
   so it owes the live frame no measurement.
8. **The transport bar floats, so it takes the raised shadow** — `--shadow-raised`, the one the
   system publishes for content that genuinely floats — and loses the purple glow, which
   `DESIGN.md` lists under Don't. Surface `surfaceRaised`, border `line`, glyphs
   `textTertiary` → `textPrimary` on hover, hover on the 120 ms feedback motion.
9. **The backdrop numbers did not move.** `UzumeAppColor.Performance` is untouched, and so is
   the certification.

**Kept as-is, flagged for Matt:** toasts still fade with the chrome (a toast raised while the
chrome is hidden is unseen until the next input — pre-existing; whether a toast should wake the
chrome is a product call). The toast stretched to the full window height inside the chrome
(pre-existing, found by the harness, fixed here; BUG-113).

## D-240: Ready is the arrival — two ready experiences, one camera push (DS.5)

**Date:** 2026-09-03 · **Increment:** DS.5 · **Status:** Accepted, M7 passed (Matt: design pass 2026-09-02, prototype approved live 2026-09-03 — *"Looks right, build it for real"*; live M7 2026-09-03 after §8/§9 — *"Ready waited for Spotify this time, copy reads fine. Push it"*)

### What Ready was

`.ready` was a waiting room built on one axis of variation, `PlaylistSource?`, and it did not
know local files exist. Local-file sessions never reached it at all: `ContentView` carried an
LF.4-era shortcut routing `.ready` straight to `PlaybackView` for any local origin, while the
engine's `.ready` observer started the local audio router and advanced to `.playing` in the same
tick. Had `ReadyView` ever been shown to one, it would have read *"Ready. Press play in your
music app"* — `ReadyViewModel` was built from `sessionSource`, `nil` for every local origin —
asking for an app that does not exist for that source, above transport controls elsewhere in the
app that already said Uzume owns local playback. (The design pass's reading of the code said the
wrong screen *was* shown; the build corrected that — the shortcut was found only when the count
failed to appear in a live run.) `ReadyView` also carried "Preview the plan", which [D-238]'s
surprise model had already ruled Forbidden (per-track preset and transition — the emotional arc).

### The decision

1. **Ready is the payoff of the aperture, not a different room.** The cave the listener watched
   widen through preparation is fully open behind both ready screens (`OpenAperture`: the same
   `ApertureScene` at openness 1, still churning; no easing, no surge, no accessibility element
   of its own). Reaching ready is the moment it opens all the way — the open question DS.4 left.
2. **Two ready experiences, one per source.** *Streaming* keeps a genuine waiting room, because
   Uzume does not control the source: "Press play in Spotify / Apple Music," `FirstAudioDetector`
   (≥250 ms sustained, unchanged), the 90 s timeout card (unchanged), and a new **"Begin now"**
   button — bordered, the same weight as End session, never a link (DS.4a proved anything quieter
   does not read as an affordance); "Enter now" was rejected as too obscure a verb. *Local files*
   get no waiting room at all: a **3-2-1 countdown** over the open cave (`LocalFileCountdownView`),
   no app named, no timeout, because nothing external can fail to arrive. Each beat is announced
   and the numeral carries its own label, so VoiceOver hears the count.
3. **The count runs over silence.** `handleLocalFileReady()` — cached BeatGrid install, LF audio
   router start, advance to `.playing` — moves from the engine's `.ready` observer to the
   countdown's completion. The music starts with the show, not three seconds before it.
4. **"Start now" always lands on `.ready`, never past it**, for both sources — one flow, no
   special case for an early start. `SessionManager` is untouched: `startNow()` is still
   `.preparing → .ready`, `beginPlayback()` still only `.ready → .playing`.
5. **One camera push, two triggers.** On entry to `.playing`, `PlaybackArrivalOverlay` runs
   `ArrivalPushScene`: the real, unmodified `ApertureScene` composited under a 100-streak radial
   burst racing outward from the opening's centre with near/far parallax, then a late whiteout,
   a 0.52 s hold, and a 0.6 s fade uncovering the already-live `MetalView`. Two prototypes were
   rejected live before this: a redrawn approximation of the aperture (*"I literally just want you
   to go from the last frame of the preparing graphic and move the camera forward"*), and a
   uniform zoom on the real frame (*"It looks like the aperture is coming out, not the camera
   moving into it"* — a flat scale has no parallax). The streaks are what read as forward travel.
   Flash-gated in the [D-157] idiom: maxΔ/frame **0.0174** against the 0.05 gate. Reduced motion:
   a still hold, then the same fade.
6. **It is a `Canvas` construction, not a GPU pass.** The design doc's early forecast — that a
   literal camera move would need geometry the camera can travel through, "closer to how the real
   preset renderer works" — was wrong, and is corrected there. The prototype settled it: parallax
   from streaks over the live 2D scene sells the move without a render pass, at zero cost to the
   preset pipeline.
7. **The plan preview is deleted, not redesigned** — `PlanPreviewView`, `PlanPreviewRowView`,
   `PlanPreviewTransitionView`, `PlanPreviewViewModel`, the sheet in `PlaybackView`, the `P`
   shortcut, `ReadyView`'s affordance and every `plan_preview.*` string. DS.4 decided it; DS.5
   executed it. `ReadyPulsingBorder` goes too: the open cave is the ambient signal now.

8. **The tap comes up at `.ready`, and the detector only trusts what the tap says** (Matt's
   M7, session `2026-09-03T15-58-14Z`; BUG-112). Ready self-advanced one second in with
   `tap RMS 0.000` — the system-audio tap had only ever been installed by `PlaybackView`, after
   `.playing`, so during Ready `FirstAudioDetector` watched `CaptureStateSurface`'s default
   `.active` and its cold-start rule fired 250 ms in. U.5's "press play and it starts" had never
   actually listened; Ready was a screen nobody looked at long enough to notice. Now the engine's
   `.ready` sink calls `startListeningForFirstAudio()` for streaming sessions — resets the surface
   to `.silent` (nothing heard yet), preflights the grant, installs the tap — and `startAudio()`
   at playback leaves a running tap alone rather than restarting it. Matt chose this over dropping
   autodetect and making "Begin now" the only door.
9. **Contrast is a scrim, not a halo** (same M7). "Ready." sat on the spill with a shadow for
   legibility; Matt: *"I am also concerned about sufficient color contrast."* `ApertureScrim` — a
   canvas-to-transparent gradient over the lower frame — now sits under the copy and buttons on
   both ready screens, so the words are always on dark whatever the cave is doing. Chosen over
   shrinking the cave and setting the copy beneath it, which would un-fill the frame at the one
   moment it is meant to be full.

## D-239: The preparation-view toggle is a destination-labeled button, not a segmented control (DS.4a)

**Date:** 2026-09-02 · **Increment:** DS.4a · **Status:** Accepted (Matt, live feedback after DS.4's M7)

### The gap DS.4 shipped with

DS.4's M7 review surfaced that `uzume.settings.visuals.preparationView` had exactly one way to
change while `.preparing`: tap the failure count line in the mysterious view, which only exists
when tracks have failed, and only ever goes one direction (mysterious → detailed). **Settings
itself is unreachable during `.preparing`** — the gear that opens it lives in the playback chrome
(`PlaybackView`'s `showSettings` sheet), which does not exist until a session is playing. So a
listener with nothing failed, in either view, had no way to switch at all.

### Three label shapes were tried and rejected before this one

1. **`Mysterious` / `Detailed`** (the words already used as the Settings picker's *hint* text,
   not its option labels there). `Detailed` reads fine alone; `Mysterious` names the feeling the
   mode goes for, not what tapping it does — a first-time listener has no way to decode it.
2. **`Simple` / `Detailed`.** Plain antonyms, but still asks a bare word to carry a mode nobody
   has context for yet.
3. **`Ambient` / `Tracks`.** Real words, no lore required — still rejected: most listeners don't
   know the Ama-no-Iwato brand story, so *any* metaphor-adjacent word (`Cave` included) fails the
   same way `Mysterious` did, evocative-but-unexplained.

The common failure wasn't the vocabulary — it was the component. A segmented control has to name
**both** states at once, permanently, side by side. These two views aren't opposite settings of
one axis (`List`/`Grid`); they're different experiences, and no word-pair said both at once
without either sounding obscure (brand language) or flat (`Hide tracks`/`Show tracks`, which Matt
called clear but boring, and which doesn't even fit a segmented control's grammar — each segment
should name a state, not issue an instruction).

### The decision

**A single button, labeled with the destination, not the current mode.** `PreparationProgressView`
gains a third bottom-bar button, between Cancel and (when unlocked) Start now, reading **"Show
track info"** while the mysterious view is showing and **"Hide track info"** while the detailed
view is showing (`preparation.toggle_track_info.show` / `.hide`; `uzume.preparing.toggleTrackInfo`).
Tapping it flips `SettingsStore.preparationView`.

This only ever has to describe one thing — what tapping does right now — and which view you're
already in is visible on screen regardless of the label. It carries the same VoiceOver clarity a
segmented control would have (a labeled button, arguably simpler than a two-segment group) without
needing two words to agree on a shared frame. "Track info" is accurate to what the detailed view
actually shows (tempo, key, mood, stem balance) without overpromising or naming mechanism.

## D-238: The preparation screen is the overture — one opening, two views, the listener chooses (DS.4)

**Date:** 2026-09-02 · **Increment:** DS.4 · **Status:** Accepted (Matt's design pass, 2026-09-02; M7 pending)

### Matt's brief, and the bar

> "i want people to feel entertained and excited during preparation"

That sentence is the whole acceptance bar. The design pass (`docs/reviews/DS.4/DESIGN.md`) records
his choices in his own words: a single opening in the cave whose light spills out and widens as
preparation proceeds; the prism of the logo, not moods of colour; an aperture that starts closed
and grows from a pinprick; "Start now" kept as a button; and **both** a mysterious view and a
detailed one, because beta listeners split on wanting mystery versus wanting to know.

### The decision

**The preparation screen is rebuilt in place around two views behind a preference**
(`uzume.settings.visuals.preparationView`, default **mysterious**):

- **Mysterious** — `PreparationAperture`: a dark cave whose opening is shut until the first
  track is heard, cracks to a pinprick, and widens through the engine's four readiness stops
  (`preparing → readyForFirstTracks → partiallyPlanned → fullyPrepared`). The identity's full
  prism spills out in every direction, more vibrant as the opening grows. It never names a
  track. The list is hidden; failures surface as a count line that opens the detailed view.
- **Detailed** — the list, rebuilt as `PreparationTrackRow` + `PreparationStatusIndicator` in
  `Views/Components/`, reporting what Uzume *heard* in each track once it is heard: tempo, key,
  mood, and a four-stem balance. Per-row `previewNotFound` / `stemSeparationFailed` stay inline.

The header and the progress bar are gone from both. `NoticeBanner` keeps its slot; "Start now"
and "Cancel" stay buttons; the network-recovery wiring and the cancel dialog are untouched.

### Why the opening tracks readiness, not completion

The design pass falsified three executions before this one (one shaft per track; a landscape of
the playlist; an averaged hue), and the common failure was **measuring the wrong quantity**: at
forty tracks, "fraction complete" is 7.5 % at the moment "Start now" unlocks. The engine already
publishes the right quantity — its readiness level — and `ApertureStop` is a pure function of
that level plus the fraction heard within it. Eight tracks and forty are the same object.

### Why the colour never varies

`BRAND.md`: *"Keep the ivory opening brighter than the surrounding spectrum"* and *"do not …
flatten the spectrum into bands"*. So the mouth is ivory, and what spills is a **continuous loop
of violet → cyan → gold → ember**, always the whole prism — exactly one loop around the circle,
so the conic gradient meets itself. Hue is identity, not data. What the playlist changes is how
the light *behaves* — `PreparationCharacter` derives churn (mood spread as circular variance),
rate (tempo), edge (spectral centroid), ribbing versus wash (drums versus vocals), mouth width
(bass) and waver (beat irregularity) from the profiles of tracks already heard, so the image
becomes more specific as more is heard. A mood-tinted cave was tried in the pass and rejected.

### The prerequisite: the profile reaches the App layer

`TrackPreparationStatus` carried only the stage. `SessionPreparer` now publishes
`trackProfiles` beside `trackStatuses` — written the moment a track becomes `.ready` on every
path (fresh analysis, cache hit, local file), cleared at the start of each pass, never set for a
failed or partial track. Publishing only: analysis order and `prefetchWindow` are untouched.
Both views are made of this.

### The surprise model still binds both views

`COMPONENTS.md`: *"Never exposes upcoming content."* The line is **heard versus will-do**: both
views may show what Uzume heard in music the listener already chose; neither shows which preset
a track gets, the emotional arc, or what is next. The detailed view is not an exemption.

### Hard constraints, and how each was met

1. **Flash safety** ([D-157]). The opening eases exponentially (τ = 2.8 s) and a landing is a
   2.4 s swell, never a flash. Measured in the `MitosisSketchRenderTests` §Criterion 4 idiom
   across a scripted 40-track preparation with a four-track burst: **maxΔ/frame 0.0100, mean
   luma 0.066–0.511**, against the 0.05 gate (`PreparationApertureTests`).
2. **Reduced motion** is first-class: the timeline pauses and the opening snaps to its stop —
   it still renders and still widens. Tested.
3. **VoiceOver**: the cave is one accessibility element carrying every fact the light conveys
   ("Preparing. 4 of 40 tracks heard." / "You can start now"); the heard count and the failure
   count are also on screen as text. No identifier changed.
4. **Preparation must not slow down.** Measured against the unmodified build on the same
   40-track playlist — `docs/reviews/DS.4/TIMING.md`.

### DEAD-002, decided

The banner's dismiss button had never rendered. It is **deleted**, not wired: every banner
error either resolves itself (rate-limited auto-retries) or is the only place a still-true
condition is stated (slow first track, total timeout), so dismissing one would hide the truth
without changing it. The identifier and its string go with it; `StatusPlacementIdentifierTests`
now pins the retirement.

### What this does not decide

Whether the opening persists into `.ready` as a held image or reaching ready is the moment it
finally opens all the way. That is DS.5's screen and needs Matt before DS.5 is written.

**References.** `docs/reviews/DS.4/DESIGN.md` (the contract); [D-232] (tokens, always dark);
[D-234]/[D-235]/[D-237] (the status placements consumed unchanged); [D-157] (the flash gate);
[D-228] (`uzume-site` owns the brand; nothing there was edited).

## D-237: The banner's three errors do not share a severity (DS.3b)

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Increment:** DS.3b · **Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, at the DS.3 M7)

### How this was found

[D-234] made `NoticeBanner` derive its tone from `error.severity`. Its predecessor took a
`UserFacingError` and never read `.severity` — the fill was a hard-coded amber, so **every banner
looked identical whatever went wrong**, and nothing could disagree with anything.

Giving it a real tone produced an unexpected result: every banner a user can reach came out **info
blue**. The increment had predicted a flip to the token warning treatment.

The mapping was not at fault. All three errors routed to `.topBanner` — `previewRateLimited`,
`preparationSlowOnFirstTrack`, `preparationTotalTimeout` — appear in `presentationMode`, in
`primaryCTAKey`, in `retryStatus`, and in **no arm of `severity`**. All three fell through to
`default: return .info`. The hard-coded amber had hidden that for the life of the component.

This is the same shape as [D-236]: a presentation value that had never been derived from the model,
exposed only when a surface finally read the model.

### The decision

The three do not share a severity, and the discriminator is one the code already encodes:
**does the user have anything to do?**

| Error | Retry | Primary CTA | Severity | Reads as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `previewRateLimited` | `.autoRetrying()` | **none** | **`info`** *(unchanged)* | Uzume is handling it |
| `preparationSlowOnFirstTrack` | none | `cta.start_reactive_mode` | **`warning`** | you may want to act |
| `preparationTotalTimeout` | none | `cta.start_reactive_mode` | **`warning`** | you may want to act |

`ErrorSeverity.warning` is documented, three lines from where it is now assigned, as *"User may want
to act, but the session can continue."* That is the definition of an error that offers a CTA while
preparation carries on. The two that offer "Start reactive mode" satisfy it exactly.

**`previewRateLimited` stays `info` deliberately.** It auto-retries and gives the user no action, so
amber would be asking for attention that cannot be spent. The test pins this alongside the two
changes precisely so a later reader does not "correct" the inconsistency — the inconsistency is the
point, and it is legible from the CTA structure.

### What it looks like

The banner reaches the bright-yellow-on-deep-field treatment DS.3 predicted — but by correcting a
misclassification, not by hard-coding a colour a second time. And it now carries **two** tones,
which is what having a tone was for: [D-234]'s stated goal was that "a degradation banner stops
looking identical to a warning banner", and until this the banner had exactly one appearance.

### The general lesson, shared with [D-236]

Twice in one increment, a surface turned out to disagree with its own taxonomy — once because a call
site overrode it, once because the taxonomy had no opinion and a hard-coded colour filled the gap.
Both were invisible until the surface was made to read the model. **A presentation value that is not
derived is a value nobody audits**, and consolidating is what forces each surface to name where its
appearance comes from.

## D-236: Sustained silence is fatal; the toast vocabulary gains `fatal` (DS.3a)

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Increment:** DS.3a · **Status:** Accepted (Matt's call, at the DS.3 M7 hard stop)

### How this was found

[D-235] mapped `degradation` to the warning tone, which turned the *"No audio detected."* toast from
red to yellow. Matt rejected that on sight: *"No audio detected is a fatal error, though... Uzume
ceases to function without audio."*

Checking the premise before acting on it turned up something neither the prompt nor the review had
looked at. **The toast's red never came from a severity classification at all.**

```swift
// PlaybackErrorBridge.showSilenceExtendedToast(), before DS.3a
toastManager.enqueue(toast(for: error, severity: .degradation, source: .signalState))
```

The severity was a literal at the call site. Meanwhile the engine's taxonomy said:

```swift
case .silenceExtended, .frameBudgetExceeded, .displayDisconnectedMidSession:
    return .warning
```

`warning` — **milder than a dropped stem**, which is `degradation`. So for months the loudest thing
on the playback screen was rated by the model as one of the mildest errors in the app, and nothing
caught it because no surface read that rating. DS.3 making the surfaces read their model is what
exposed it. That is the increment working, not failing.

### The decision

**Silence is fatal.** Uzume's visuals are audio-driven; with no audio the product is not delivering,
whatever the render loop is doing. `ErrorSeverity.fatal` is documented as "session cannot continue
without user action", and silence fits the spirit if not the letter — the session cannot *usefully*
continue, and the user is the only one who can fix a routing or playback problem.

It remains **condition-bound**: `isConditionBound == true`, and the toast still dismisses itself when
audio returns. `fatal` describes what the user is getting, not whether the process can proceed. That
is a deliberate widening of what the case means, recorded here so the next reader does not "fix" it.

### Why this could not be done inside DS.3

`UzumeToast.Severity` had **no `fatal` case**, and the bridge collapsed the distinction:

```swift
case .degradation, .fatal:  toastSeverity = .degradation   // before
```

Fatal-ness died in the narrower enum *before any view saw it*, so no amount of tone mapping in
`StatusTone` could recover it — [D-234] mapped faithfully from a vocabulary that had already thrown
the information away. Making the silence toast red therefore required changing `ErrorSeverity`,
`UzumeToast.Severity`, and an error's assigned severity: three things DS.3 explicitly forbade,
because each has engine reach. Matt approved crossing that boundary as a follow-on increment on the
same branch rather than deferring it.

### What changed

| Change | File |
|---|---|
| `silenceExtended` → `.fatal` | `UzumeEngine/Sources/Shared/UserFacingError+Presentation.swift` |
| `Severity` gains `fatal`; `init(_: ErrorSeverity)` added | `UzumeApp/Models/UzumeToast.swift` |
| Fold removed; call site stops hard-coding | `UzumeApp/Services/PlaybackErrorBridge.swift` |
| `fatal → danger` | `UzumeApp/Views/Components/StatusTone.swift` |
| Never-drop rule covers `fatal` | `UzumeApp/ViewModels/ToastManager.swift` |
| *"Critical"* alongside *"Alert"* | `AccessibilityLabels.swift` + `Localizable.strings` |

**The mapping moved onto the model.** `UzumeToast.Severity.init(_ severity: ErrorSeverity)` is now
the only place an engine severity becomes a toast severity — no call site picks one by hand again.
That is the same discipline [D-234] applied to colour, applied one layer up, and it is what made the
original defect possible: a presentation value chosen at a call site is a value nobody audits.

**VoiceOver improved as a side effect.** The silence toast announces as *"Critical: No audio
detected."* rather than *"Alert: …"*. A blind Curator now hears the severity distinction the sighted
one gets from the accent bar.

### The general lesson

A hard-coded presentation value at a call site is invisible to every audit that reads the model. The
three-maps-into-one work found this only because consolidating forced each surface to name where its
tone came from. **When a surface disagrees with its own taxonomy, suspect the call site before the
taxonomy** — and check which one the user has actually been looking at.

**References.** [D-234] (the vocabulary); [D-235] (the degradation reading this refines);

## D-234: One severity vocabulary — `StatusTone` (DS.3)

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Increment:** DS.3 · **Status:** Accepted

### The problem

The app had four status placements, two severity enums, and **three independent
severity-to-colour maps** that disagreed with each other. Read from source at the DS.3
branch point:

| Severity | Full-screen | Toast | Banner | Inline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `info` | `textPrimary` | `#64D2FF` | *severity ignored* | *severity not modelled* |
| `warning` | system `.orange` | `#FFD60A` | *severity ignored* | *severity not modelled* |
| `degradation` | system `.yellow` | `#FF8A75` | *severity ignored* | *severity not modelled* |
| `fatal` | system `.red` | *no such case* | *severity ignored* | *severity not modelled* |

Two conflicts. **`degradation` was yellow on the full-screen surfaces and red in
toasts** — settled by [D-235]. **The banner ignored severity entirely**: it took an
`error: UserFacingError` and never read `.severity`, rendering a hard-coded amber fill
with near-black text whatever went wrong.

### The decision

`UzumeApp/Views/Components/StatusTone.swift` is the single place a severity becomes a
presentation. Four tones matching the roles `tokens.css` publishes — `info`, `success`,
`warning`, `danger` — each resolving to a `--color-status-*` foreground/background/border
triple plus one SF Symbol. Dark block only, no appearance branch ([D-232]).

Exactly two mapping functions, one per source vocabulary. No view switches on a severity
again.

**Neither source enum changes.** `ErrorSeverity` is engine-owned in `Shared`;
`UzumeToast.Severity` is app-owned and narrower (no `fatal`). `StatusTone` maps *from*
both rather than replacing either — unifying them reaches into the engine and belongs to
its own increment. The consequence is recorded rather than papered over: `PlaybackErrorBridge`
folds `fatal` into `degradation` before a toast is built, so that distinction is lost
upstream of presentation and no amount of tone work recovers it.

**Every tone carries a symbol**, because `COMPONENTS.md` § Trust explanation requires that
status colour may support but never replace text or icon.

`success` has no producer — both source vocabularies describe things going wrong. It is
carried because the published role set is four, so the first non-error status surface finds
it existing rather than inventing it.

### Four placements, not one

`COMPONENTS.md` § Status placements is explicit, and DS.3 followed it: a banner that
persists, an inline notice that clears itself after six seconds, a toast that queues three
deep and announces itself, and a screen that blocks are four different products. They share
tone and icon rules and nothing else.

| Component | Interruption | Lifetime | Triple used |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RecoveryScreen` | blocks the view behind it | until an action is taken | foreground (icon) |
| `NoticeBanner` | strip above the list | until the view model changes state | all three |
| `InlineNotice` | inside an existing pane | 6 s auto-clear, or tap | foreground (pip) |
| `PerformanceToast` | during a performance | queued, auto-dismiss | foreground (accent bar) |

The two quiet placements take only the foreground and set it against the app canvas rather
than the tone's own background — a pairing the published triple does not describe. Measured
at 8.51:1 (`danger`) and 13.85:1 (`warning`); reported upstream, since it holds by luck of a
dark canvas rather than by anything the tokens guarantee.

### `RecoveryScreen` absorbed a view that had never shipped

`FullScreenErrorView` and `PreparationFailureView` were near-verbatim duplicates — same
`body`, `icon`, `textBlock`, `actions`, `headline`, and byte-identical severity switches.
**`FullScreenErrorView` had zero construction sites** and had never appeared in a shipped
build; its only non-doc reference outside itself was its *path*, as a string in the
fixed-font ratchet, which meant it was being maintained for a screen no user could reach.
Recorded as **DEAD-003**. So the merge was in truth a deletion plus a rename, and the
surviving layout is `PreparationFailureView`'s, reached through the same
`PreparationProgressView` `.fullScreen` branch.

The census (`PHOSPHENE-COMPONENT-CENSUS.md` § Migration order step 3) and the app's own
`APP_VIEWS.md:440` both describe it as active. Both are wrong; reported upstream.

### Identifiers are contracts

All five keep their `preparation.*` spelling even though neither carrying component is named
for preparation any more:

```
uzume.preparation.topBanner            uzume.view.preparationFailure
uzume.preparation.topBanner.dismiss    uzume.preparationFailure.pickPlaylist
                                       uzume.preparationFailure.startReactive
```

An identifier is a contract with whatever drives the UI, not a description of the type that
carries it. Pinned by `StatusPlacementIdentifierTests`; the captured accessibility rows are
byte-identical before and after (`diff docs/reviews/DS.3/{before,after}/a11y.txt` empty).

## D-235: Degraded operation reads as caution, not alarm (DS.3)

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Increment:** DS.3 · **Status:** Accepted — Matt chose A explicitly in session, 2026-09-01 (*"I agree with your recommendations regarding degradation toasts"*), not carried on the no-reply default.

### The question

Uzume has one severity called `degradation` — it still works, but something is compromised:
stem separation failed, a preview is missing, audio has gone undetected. It rendered two
ways. Full-screen it was yellow, the middle step between amber warning and red fatal. In a
toast during a performance it was red, the loudest thing on screen. Same word, opposite
readings. `StatusTone` forces one answer.

### The decision

`degradation` → `warning`. Amber-family everywhere; `danger` is reserved for `fatal`.

The reasoning is the severity's own definition in `UserFacingError+Presentation.swift`:
*"Uzume is operating in degraded mode"* — which is explicitly not *"the session cannot
continue without user action"*, the definition of `fatal` sitting three lines below it. A
dropped stem or a missing preview is Uzume saying it is coping, and the performance is still
running.

**Keeping red meaningful is the real argument.** A red toast that appears while the visuals
are still playing teaches people that red does not mean stop. Spending `danger` on states
that do not require action devalues it for the two that do — network gone, every track failed.

**The cost, stated honestly:** the *"No audio detected."* toast becomes less alarming. If
silence should shout, that argues for reclassifying `silenceExtended` as `fatal` — a change
to which severity an error *has* — not for making every degradation red.

### Rejected: a fifth tone

Honest to the distinction, but the design system publishes four status roles and the app
would be inventing palette — exactly what [D-232]'s vendored-token discipline exists to
prevent. A fifth colour is a design-system change that starts in `uzume-site`, not a colour
the app mixes for itself.

### Found while implementing, and deliberately not settled here

Giving the banner a real tone exposed something the increment did not predict. The three
errors routed to the banner — `previewRateLimited`, `preparationSlowOnFirstTrack`,
`preparationTotalTimeout` — are named in `presentationMode` but in **no arm of `severity`**,
so all three fall through to its `default: return .info`. **Every banner a user can reach is
now info blue, not warning yellow.** The old banner concealed this by being hard-coded amber.

This is correct behaviour under this increment's constraints: DS.3 was barred from changing
which severity an error has. Whether "preparing more slowly than usual" should read as
caution rather than information is a change to `ErrorSeverity` in the engine, with its own
increment and Matt's call. Shown at the DS.3 M7 hard stop rather than absorbed silently.

## D-230: On-disk output paths renamed; code and data moved together (RN.5)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-08-31 · Closes the second of [D-227]'s four deferred surfaces.

**Why it was deferred, and what changed.** RN.2 left these alone because they are
**user-visible** — `~/Documents/phosphene_sessions/` is where Matt's captures live — and
that made it a product call rather than an engineering one. Matt gave the go at RN.4's
close. Nothing about the technical picture changed; the ownership question was the blocker.

**The coupling is the decision.** These paths are string literals in `SessionRecorder`,
`BeatBench`, `SoakTestHarness`, the diagnostic CLIs and a dozen `Scripts/`. Renaming the
code without moving the directories orphans 5.7 GB of captures from every tool that reads
them; moving the directories without the code sweep breaks the tools immediately. They are
one operation, and the increment is scoped that way deliberately.

**What moved:** `phosphene_sessions` → `uzume_sessions` (5.7 GB / 16 captures),
`phosphene_beatbench_fixtures` → `uzume_beatbench_fixtures` (946 MB / 21 fixtures),
`phosphene_soak`, `phosphene_features.csv`, `phosphene_diag.log`, `/tmp/phosphene_visual`,
and the ephemeral test-temp prefixes (`phosphene_recorder_tests_`, `phosphene_hang_`,
`phosphene_hooks`, `phosphene_replay`, `phosphene_census`). Post-move inventory verified
entry-for-entry at the new paths.

**What did not, and why each is principled rather than lazy:**

- **`phosphene_grid_bpm`** — not a path at all. It is a **key inside recorded BeatBench
  ground-truth JSON**. Renaming it edits recorded evidence, which is the one thing the
  fixture corpus exists to prevent. It stays, and the reader who wonders why finds this.
- **`~/phosphene-ml-env`** — Matt's Python virtualenv. Renaming the *reference* without
  renaming his venv breaks the documented command; renaming his venv is not this repo's call.
- **`/Volumes/Extreme SSD/phosphene_corpus_manifest.csv`**, **`~/phosphene_section_lab/`**,
  **`~/phosphene_session_mining/`** — external artifacts, two of them from removed or
  deliberately-uncommitted work, cited only in historical rationale.

**~250 references in `docs/diagnostics/` and `docs/prompts/` keep the old paths.** They are
frozen records of past sessions — the same trade [D-227] made for the rest of the rename.
A reader following a 2026-07 diagnostic will find the path moved; the date on the document
is the signal, and the captures themselves survived under the new name.

## D-231: Runtime string identity completes the rename (RN.6)

**Status:** Accepted · 2026-09-01 · Closes the last two of [D-227]'s four deferred surfaces.
Phase RN ends here.

### 1. Persisted `UserDefaults` keys — the rename and the migration are one commit

RN.2 deferred these with a specific reason: *"renaming silently resets every user's
settings."* That is still true, so the rename ships **with** the migration, never before it.
Eleven keys move to `uzume.*` and eleven `SettingsMigrator` entries carry the values across:
the eight `phosphene.settings.*` keys, `phosphene.lf.recents`,
`phosphene.onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`, and
`phosphene.cache.localFile.maxBytes` — the last read by the **engine**
(`PersistentStemCache`) but migrated by the app, which is correct: same defaults domain,
and the app is the only process that runs a migration.

**No entry depends on another.** The pre-scheme U.6 key
(`phosphene.showLiveAdaptationToasts`) is retargeted to point straight at
`uzume.settings.visuals.showLiveAdaptationToasts` rather than chaining through the
intermediate name, so an install that never launched between U.6 and RN.6 lands correctly
in a single pass. Ordering is not load-bearing, and the code says so rather than relying on
array order nobody would notice breaking.

**The test asserts the whole set, and it was proven able to fail.** A key added to
`SettingsStore` but forgotten in the migration map now fails
`rn6_everyPersistedKeyMigratesToUzumeNamespace` rather than silently resetting that setting
on a user's next launch. Negative control run: deleting one migration entry turns the suite
red with `phosphene.lf.recents did not reach uzume.lf.recents — the setting would silently
reset`. A migration test that cannot fail is worse than none, because it certifies nothing
while looking like coverage.

### 2. Shader comments and preset sidecars — prose only, proven

22 comment hits across 11 `.metal` files and 5 `.json` `description`/`author` fields.
RN.2's "do not edit shaders or presets" constraint was scoped to *that* increment; this one
opens under the `preset-session` skill as CLAUDE.md requires.

**Two independent checks establish that nothing visual moved**, rather than asserting it:
every changed `.metal` line was matched against a comment-marker pattern (zero code lines
changed), and the **preset golden-hash regression suite passes unchanged** — those hashes
are byte-level renders, so any shader behaviour change would break them. The
`PresetLoader` / `FidelityRubric` / `RouteCoverage` sidecar-schema gates also pass, which
covers the `.json` edits.

The full `preset-session` protocol — contact sheets, per-trait verdict tables, M7 — exists
for **tuning** increments where the visual result is the deliverable. Applying it to a
comment sweep would be ceremony; the golden hashes are the honest gate here, and they are
strictly stronger than a human looking at a still.

## D-243: Bar position is recorded per window, and a declined window emits no bars

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Increment:** PR.17 · **Status:** Accepted as a mechanism; **default REVERTED to OFF on 2026-09-07** — see §Amendment. Opt in with `UZUME_BARLINE_LOCAL=1`

### The decision

`BeatGrid.downbeats` is populated by scoring bar position once per ~80 beats (~40 s) rather than
once per track, and **a window that declines contributes nothing**. Where the evidence does not
carry a bar, a preset gets no bar-driven motion — it never gets an accent on a guessed beat.

Matt was asked to choose between two shapes and chose the first:

- **Sparse and correct** — bars only where the structure is real; nothing ever fires on a wrong beat, and some sections of a song have no bar-driven motion.
- **Dense with fallback** — keep the model's downbeats where the estimator declines; bar events fire throughout, and some are on the wrong beat.

His answer: *"Sparse and correct."*

### Why the shape, not just the threshold, was the problem

Tempo taught this first. `BeatGrid` recorded `bpm` as one whole-track average, and past the end of
`beats` every consumer ran on it; against music whose tempo moves, that is a linear phase error
(BUG-065). Matt's correction — *"you should not be averaging BPM / tempo, you should be recording it
over the duration of the track"* — applies to the bar identically. A single meter-and-phase per track
has to describe an intro, a chorus and an outro at once, and PR.15 measured that it does that worse
than the old 30 s clip did.

`downbeats: [Double]` was already the right structure for a per-section record, and
`beatsSinceDownbeat` already counts from the nearest preceding entry. Only the population was wrong.

### Why this does not re-litigate the FT.2 rejection

FT.2's wiring was rejected on 2026-09-04 (*"B is not a viable option"*) because the estimator
declined on 7 of 9 tracks and a decline meant no bars anywhere on that track — taking the downbeat
push away from Nacre and Glaze on most music, which [D-205] makes a hard gate. The revisit condition
recorded was a materially lower decline rate.

Both premises moved. The decline rate was an artifact of feeding a whole-track estimator a 30 s
clamped grid (~40–60 beats where it was designed for 300–700); PR.12 removed the clamp. And the
all-or-nothing granularity is gone: a track can now carry bars through the sections that have them.

### What it costs, stated

On *Low*, bar coverage drops from 10 of 11 tracks to 6, and one of the losses — Be My Wife — has a
correct meter and the tightest phase on the record today. That cost is the direct consequence of the
shape Matt chose; it was put to him with those numbers and he turned it on anyway.

It also costs **0.89 s/track** of preparation against [D-242]'s 7.5 s/track budget for all stages.

**It shipped without a live M7.** Whether bars going quiet mid-song reads as responsive or as
flickering is a felt question, and nothing has played this yet. `UZUME_BARLINE_LOCAL=0` is the
revert if it reads wrong.

**References.** [D-205] (meter/downbeat is a hard gate); [D-207] (decline is part of the output
contract); [D-210]; PR.12/PR.15/PR.16;
`docs/diagnostics/PR17_LOCAL_BARS_2026-09-05.md`;
`UzumeEngine/Sources/DSP/BarLineEstimator+Windowed.swift`.

### Amendment — the default is reverted (2026-09-07)

Default-ON lasted one session. Matt, after it: *"Ferrofluid Ocean … the beat sync is worse not
better. Fractal Tree is too animated. Witchlight has no pulse. The pulse of Aurora Veil is no longer
in sync with music. Everything is worse."*

**The estimator was not the problem; the decline path was.** A declined track reports
`beatsPerBar = 1` with empty `downbeats`, and `beatsSinceDownbeat` falls back to
`idx % max(beatsPerBar, 1)` — zero for every beat. "No bar information" was encoded as "every beat
is bar one", which is the opposite of declining, and every bar-locked preset fired four times too
often. Session `2026-09-06T00-17-00Z`: `beatsPerBar == 1` on 91 % of frames.

The windowed measurement stands — take_five decodes 5/4 and money 7/4, 20 correct and 0 incorrect
across 68 windows. What changed is which path is common: the model's downbeat head almost always
answered, so the decline encoding was rarely exercised; the estimator declines about two thirds of
the time, so it became the norm.

**What was actually wrong with the decision.** The choice put to Matt was sparse-versus-dense bars,
and he was told the cost was *"bar-locked events fire correctly in some sections and go quiet in
others."* That was not what sparse did. It made them fire on every beat. The option he accepted was
never the option that shipped, so his answer cannot carry the weight of this outcome.

Tracked as BUG-117. Do not re-enable the default until a declined track reports no bars in a way
consumers can read as no bars.

## D-244: Root Choir keeps harmonic geometry on a compact stateful direct path (ROOTCHOIR.1)

**Status:** Accepted for uncertified review · 2026-09-09

Root Choir is a direct eight-iteration Newton fractal over five ordered roots. Fifths rotates the
whole constellation; thirds skews alternating petals; tension changes root radii and the centre
aperture; consonance changes saturation and seam clarity; bass adds only a bounded 0.94…1.06
whole-field breath. Root index, not nearest screen sector or current angle, owns colour identity.
That makes harmony change the polynomial geometry without allowing a morph to exchange colours.

The two wrapped tonal phases do not travel through `FeatureVector` scalar filtering. A dedicated
`RootChoirState` applies the existing `CircularPhaseSmoother` to unit vectors at τ 1.4 s, then
writes a 32-byte block to direct fragment buffer(6) using the renderer's existing preset tick and
buffer hooks. This is intentionally preset-local: the global `FeatureVector` ABI does not change,
and no generic renderer mechanism is added. At low tonal confidence the shader circularly blends
to a slowly rotating canonical five-root constellation, preserving a dim non-black silence state.

The first render was structurally right but materially too pastel. The retained correction lowered
linear-light palette values, preserved more chroma at low consonance, and let cream/gold dominate
the selected recursive seams; the Newton geometry and audio mappings did not move. Offline review
now supports the concept, but does not certify it: the real-music contact sheet and temporal gate
are evidence for a live M7, after which the next call is tune, redesign, or retire.

**ROOTCHOIR.2 amendment after the first M7 rejection (2026-09-09).** The decision to map fifths
as an unconstrained whole-constellation angle did not survive contact with real tonal data: phase
steps were large enough that the musical route read chiefly as disorienting spin. Fifths still
orients the complete root system, but through `0.34*sin(phi5)`; thirds supplies chirality and a
bounded-angle complex-domain fold; tension controls fold depth and the aperture after calibration
to the supplied capture. The canonical rest state now drifts pendularly instead of completing
turns. The radial orbit trap and cream/white seam path were also rejected because together they
authored the reported circular particle ring. These are preset-local mapping changes; the compact
slot-6 architecture and stable root identities remain the accepted part of D-244.
