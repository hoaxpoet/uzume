// PresetSidecarKeyGateTests — an unrecognised sidecar key is a failure, not a silent no-op.
//
// `PresetDescriptor` is `Codable`, and synthesized `Codable` **ignores keys it does not
// know**. A sidecar can therefore carry a field that looks authoritative, reads as live to
// anyone opening the file, and is never decoded by anything.
//
// This is not hypothetical. D-120 added `concept_tags` + `motion_paradigm` to the sidecar
// schema; D-123 reverted them the next day and the revert was clean — the CA.4 audit's
// 2026-05-20 grep correctly reported zero residue. Both fields nonetheless reappeared in
// two sidecars created *months later* (CymaticResonance.json 2026-07-22, Meniscus.json
// 2026-08-03), because the design docs those presets were authored from still prescribed
// them. Nothing rejected the keys, so nothing noticed until MD.0 went looking. A clean
// grep is a statement about a moment; this gate is a statement about every commit.
//
// The same shape bit the provenance block one level down: `Witchlight.json` carried a
// bespoke `sha256_subject` key that no schema mentioned and no reader consumed.
//
// The gate does not decide what an unknown key *should* be — it forces the decision to be
// explicit. Decode it, allow-list it here with a reason, or delete it.
