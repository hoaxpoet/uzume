// StemModel+Graph — MPSGraph construction for Open-Unmix HQ inference.
//
// Builds a single MPSGraph containing all 4 stems. Each stem is an
// independent subgraph sharing the same input placeholder. The graph is
// compiled once at init and reused for every predict() call.
//
// Architecture per stem (corrected per 3.7b weight extraction):
//   Input [431, 2, 1487] → InputNorm → Reshape [431, 2974]
//   → FC1(2974→512) + BN1 + Tanh
//   → LSTM(3 layers, bidirectional, hidden=256, output=512)
//   → concat(fc1_out, lstm_out) → [431, 1024]
//   → FC2(1024→512) + BN2 + ReLU
//   → FC3(512→4098) + BN3 + OutputDenorm
//   → Reshape [431, 2, 2049] → ReLU(mask) × input → Output [431, 2, 2049]
