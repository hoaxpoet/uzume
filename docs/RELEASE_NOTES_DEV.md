# Uzume — Developer Release Notes

Internal release notes for the `main` branch. Audience: Matt and Claude Code. Each entry covers one session or a logical batch of increments. These notes complement `docs/ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` (authoritative for what's planned) and `docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (authoritative for open defects).

User-visible release notes are not yet in scope (no public build).

Older entries: `RELEASE_NOTES_DEV_YYYY-MM.md` (one file per month).

**Entry ids are `[dev-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS]`** (UTC time-of-day the entry is written — e.g. `date -u +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S`). They are unique by construction, so **never hand-assign sequential `-a`/`-b`/`-c` letters** — parallel sessions independently picking the next letter was a recurring merge-renumbering tax (DOC.8). Older `-a/-b/-c` entries are grandfathered; `rotate_docs.sh` / `DocIntegrityTests` key only on the `YYYY-MM-DD` date, so the suffix format is free. This file is also **`merge=union`** (`.gitattributes`): concurrent appends from two sessions auto-combine instead of conflicting — so keep it **prepend-only prose**, never edit an existing entry in place (union would duplicate it).

### [dev-2026-09-09-205204] ROOTCHOIR.2 / BUG-125 — remove the particle ring and make harmony reshape instead of spin

Matt's first live review rejected Root Choir: *“There is still white particles in a circular ring pattern,” “the center … looks like a muddle,” “not understanding the connection to the music,”* and *“the spin is odd and somewhat disorienting.”* The attached “Combat Baby” capture is clean and all five declared inputs fire, so this was the preset—not the audio or renderer.

The causes were authored and measurable. A radial orbit trap (`abs(length(z) - radius)`) was promoted into near-white highlights, directly drawing the ring. Live `tonal_tension` topped out at 0.091 while the aperture expected 0…1, leaving the centre nearly closed. Fifths/thirds changed by about 0.86/0.89 rad per analysis update, yet fifths was mapped directly to the whole organism's angle, making rotation the dominant response.

ROOTCHOIR.2 deletes the radial trap and white seam colour, uses dark leadwork with sparse amber light, maps the real tension/consonance ranges across their visual spans, grows a clean five-sided aperture, and bounds fifths orientation to ±0.34 rad. Thirds and tension now rotate/deepen a complex quadratic/cubic fold of the Newton starting domain, so harmony reorganizes basin topology rather than turning the frame. The preset remains uncertified and BUG-125 remains pending M7.

Evidence: clean session `2026-09-09T20-25-49Z`; route replay at `/private/tmp/root-choir-session-review/replay_report.md`; before sheet `/tmp/uzume_visual/20260909T203906/root_choir_compare.png`; after frames `/tmp/uzume_visual/20260909T204953/`; motion sequence `/tmp/uzume_visual/20260909T205058/` (430 frames). Focused tests, performance, lint, and app build are recorded in the closeout.
## [dev-2026-09-09-160000] Arachne removed from the roster (D-246)

Matt's call under PR.9's certify-or-remove gate. The orb-weaver preset rendered broken with zero audio
coupling and no reference images after eight design iterations, so certifying it would have meant
authoring it again rather than repairing it. ~6,100 lines deleted: shader, sidecar, the `Arachnid/`
state machine, its orchestrator signalling conformance, five test suites, both design docs and the
visual-reference directory. Roster 30 → 29 production presets.

The segmented-session machinery Arachne motivated is generic and stays — `PresetMaxDuration`,
`PlannedPresetSegment`, `PresetSignaling`. Arachne was the only conformer to the completion-signalling
protocol, so every track now plans as a single segment, which is what non-signalling presets already
did. Two sidecar keys are zero-adopter by design and declared as such.

Consequence worth tracking: the `staged` paradigm now has **no production preset**, only the two
diagnostic sandboxes. Its reference template was retargeted from Arachne to Staged Sandbox.

### [dev-2026-09-08-192543] BUG-065 measured for the first time — the premise does not reproduce (kept OPEN)

544 seconds, one continuous track (LCD Soundsystem, *Dance Yrself Clean*), whole-track grid, meter 4. The best evidence this defect has had, and it says the defect as written is not there.

**The error that reaches the viewer** — `onset_residual_ms`, recorded for the first time this afternoon: p50 **14.9 ms**, p90 26.7, max 29.8, signed mean **−0.1 ms**, **100 % inside the ~60 ms perceptual window**, flat across all nine minutes.

**The correction** — `drift_ms` — goes 0 → **−153 ms** at five and a half minutes → **+3 ms at the end**. It reverses. Only 26 of 54 buckets move away from zero, where a genuine clock mismatch moves essentially all of them. That is a bounded offset excursion the tracker absorbs, most likely following which percussive element dominates as the arrangement changes, not drift.

**The original evidence was the compensation.** This entry has always cited `drift_ms` growing 0 → 119 ms as the defect. `drift_ms` is what the tracker APPLIES (`displayTime = pt + drift + shift`); the error is what survives it, and nothing recorded that until today.

**Two false starts on the way, both mine, both corrected by measurement.** A 0.81 ms/s "clock mismatch" fitted to four buckets, two of which were the EMA still converging from zero — after convergence the slope is +0.37 ms/s, the opposite sign. And a resampler hypothesis derived from that bad fit: the probe was still worth running (it clears the grid's time base to −3 ppm over two minutes) but it was built to test a number that was an artifact.

**Kept OPEN at Matt's call.** One sequenced-electronic track with machine-steady timing is not proof for live-played material with real rubato. The remaining ±15 ms residual floor is a separate question — plausibly the gap between the app's assumed 50 ms output latency and the Duet 3's measured 11.2 ms, which a tap-side residual is structurally blind to.

---

### [dev-2026-09-08-181826] BUG-065 — the drift evidence has always measured the correction, not the error

Matt: *"Work on drift first."* The first thing to look at was what `drift_ms` actually is, and it is not what every diagnosis of this defect has assumed.

**`drift_ms` is the CORRECTION, not the error.** `LiveBeatDriftTracker` applies it: `displayTime = pt + drift + displayShift`, and that is the time the phase presets consume is computed at. So a large `drift_ms` says the tracker is working hard, not that the visuals are late. The snapshot field's own doc comment says so — *"Drift-tracker correction in milliseconds"* — and it was still read as error, by BUG-065's original diagnosis (*"0 → 119 ms across a track"*) and by me two days ago (*"34 ms mean, 77 ms p90, outside the perceptual window"*).

**The actual error was computed and thrown away.** `processOnsetLocked` derives `signedDeviation = instantDrift - drift` — how far a matched onset fell from the CORRECTED grid position — uses it for the variance-adaptive tight gate, and discards it. In a defect whose entire subject is timing accuracy, the quantity that measures timing accuracy has never been recorded.

**Instrumented, not fixed.** `onset_residual_ms` now sits beside `drift_ms` in features.csv, carried on `BeatSyncSnapshot`. Two tests encode the distinction so it cannot be confused again: against a steadily offset track the correction absorbs the offset while the residual settles near zero, and with no grid the residual is absent rather than a confident zero.

**No fix is proposed.** D-206 parked this pending a changed GRID premise; whole-track grids supply that (coverage 18 % → 98 %). But the premise change is not evidence, and there is still no measurement of the real error. The next session Matt records will produce the first one.

### [dev-2026-09-08-173808] BUG-121 — one quiet window condemned the session and nudged the listener

Matt: *"in the last few sessions, I was seeing notifications that the signal source was low… this has been a problem historically, and I would like to resolve it once and for all."*

**It fired on a single 5-second window.** Across every session on disk, each "degraded" verdict is exactly one: 1 of 68, 1 of 20, 1 of 34. `band=low` has **never** fired in his history — the trigger was always a lone `band=critical` at −18.6 to −24.5 dBFS, landing mid-session (sample 59 of 68, 10 of 20, 21 of 34). Those are fades, gaps between tracks, soft passages. Music has them; every session has one.

**Why the previous fix did not hold.** D-197's follow-up already addressed this once as "degraded only after loud" — a quiet window counts only if a healthy one preceded it. That removes the quiet OPENING and nothing else, so the false positive moved into the middle of the song, where every track has one. Patching the symptom's location rather than its shape is why it came back.

**Fix.** The live toast and the offline verdict both require **3 consecutive** low/critical windows, from one shared constant so what the listener sees and what a closeout cites cannot disagree. At the ~5 s cadence that is ~15 s during which the peak never once crossed −15 dBFS: music does not do that while playing, a misrouted chain does it permanently. A healthy window resets the run, so two dips in one song stay two dips.

**Verified in both directions on his real data.** Re-grading his actual sessions flips every false positive to `clean` while the already-clean ones stay clean; the negative control — a chain quiet in *every* window — still grades `degraded`; and the boundary is asserted (a run of 2 does not flag, 3 does) so the threshold cannot drift quietly.

**Also filed: BUG-120**, the Witchlight defect fixed earlier today and live-confirmed, which had no KNOWN_ISSUES entry until the doc gate caught the gap in the numbering.

### [dev-2026-09-08-135334] BUG-119 — the beat pulse held one average BPM for a whole track; that was Ferrofluid Ocean's grain

Matt, 2026-09-07: *"Ferrofluid Ocean is pixelated / grainy - doesn't look like it used to look."* Then, after the reverts: *"Yes, FFO's grain is back to normal."* That second message is what identified it — only the beat-grid changes could reach FFO, so the grain had to come from one of them.

**Cause.** `MIRPipeline.setBeatGrid` called `beatPulseClock.setTempo(bpm: grid?.bpm)` once per track. The pulse period is `(60 / bpm) x 4` and nothing revisited it for the rest of the song, so a single median BPM governed the pulse for an entire track. PR.12 changed which median got computed — bleed 115.0 → 123.6, money 116.2 → 129.3, bohemian 78.2 → 94.2 — and a pulse running 7–20 % off drifts against the music. Ferrofluid Ocean's `spike_punch_region` accents then fire off the beat, which reads as spatial incoherence rather than a pulse: the grain.

**This was Matt's own instruction, still unimplemented.** 2026-09-04: *"you should not be averaging BPM / tempo, you should be recording it over the duration of the track so that visuals are better synced."* PR.12 widened the analysis window and then collapsed the result back into one number at track change, so the averaging survived the change meant to remove it. Widening the window was never the point; not averaging was.

**Fix.** `BeatPulseClock.trackLocalBeatPeriod(_:at:)` follows the grid's LOCAL seconds-per-beat from `BeatGrid.localTiming`, published each frame by `LiveBeatDriftTracker.lastLocalBeatPeriod` — read from the tracker rather than the grid because the tracker owns the mapping from the live clock onto track time. Two properties, both tested: it must not JUMP the phase (phase is `(time − anchor) / period`, so the anchor is rewritten to preserve elapsed BEATS through a rate change), and it must not WOBBLE (smoothed at α = 0.02/frame, anchor only rewritten past a 0.5 % change — one stray beat does not move the pulse, a sustained change is followed).

**What this unblocks.** BUG-118's whole-track default stays off until Matt confirms live, but the reason it hurt is now removed: a better grid no longer means a worse pulse. The remaining blocker for re-enabling it is the downbeat side — billie_jean's beats are flat at 8–9 ms error across a whole track while its downbeat F falls 0.90 → 0.37 over the same span. Beats extend; the model's downbeat head does not.

1919 engine tests green, swiftlint 0. **Outstanding: Matt's live confirmation on a local file.**

### [dev-2026-09-07-153851] REVERT — the tiled whole-track grid and the Dragon Bloom tint; everything I broke, back off

Matt, after the BUG-117 revert did not restore the presets: *"There are still issues with FFO due to changes you introduced. You haven't reverted enough if presets are still broken."* Correct. Then, on scope: *"we need whole-track grids and counted meters. But perhaps they were not implemented correctly."* Also correct — and the distinction matters, because the capability is not the defect.

**BUG-118 — the tiled whole-track grid is worse than the 30 s clamp it replaced.** Five-suite BeatBench, finally run on the shipping configuration. The BPM column is span-independent, so no scoring artifact excuses it: bleed truth 114.67, clamped **115.00**, tiled **123.62**; money 121.06 / **116.19** / 129.32; pyramid_song 66.60 / **65.08** / 82.47; yyz 272.27 / **233.61** / 145.85. Beat F regresses on 5 of 9 (bleed 0.99 → 0.76, money 0.44 → 0.24), continuity with it (bleed CMLt 1.00 → 0.56), and billie_jean's downbeat F falls 0.90 → 0.37. Default reverted to the clamped grid; `UZUME_WHOLETRACK_GRID=1` opts back in.

**How it shipped.** PR.12's closeout claimed "beat F equal or better on 8 of 9". That measurement trimmed both arms to a common span — correct as far as it went — and was then treated as sufficient. The program requires a five-suite BeatBench table for any behavioural change to a beat signal. It was never produced for the shipping configuration, through PR.12, PR.17 and two closeouts that quoted beat numbers. Running it took fifteen minutes and would have stopped all of this before Matt ever saw it.

**PR.5 reverted — the Dragon Bloom invert tint.** Matt: *"you did not fix the issue - you just chose a different color."* True. The defect is that the feedback field never fills, and tinting the empty part is a change of colour standing in for a fix. `bInvert` is back to Milkdrop's literal `1 - c`.

**Not reverted, deliberately.** `computeMeter` counting beats stays: it reports the mode of beats-between-downbeats faithfully, and the `meter = 1` that did the damage comes from the model's over-firing downbeat head, which predates all of this. BUG-116's stem fix stays: it repaired a defect with a measured before/after (48 kHz local files reading silence 15 % of the time) and is not part of Phase PR.

**Still unexplained and still open:** Ferrofluid Ocean's grainy appearance, Dragon Bloom's unfilled field (BUG-118 is not its cause — eleven hypotheses tested against a live butterchurn oracle, all dead), and why `treble` reaches presets as 0.003 on material whose source file measures the same as the tap.

### [dev-2026-09-07-142316] REVERT — the windowed bar line is OFF again; a declined track was calling every beat a downbeat

Matt, after one session on the 2026-09-05 build: *"Ferrofluid Ocean … the beat sync is worse not better. Fractal Tree is too animated. Witchlight has no pulse. The pulse of Aurora Veil is no longer in sync with music. Everything is worse."*

**Cause: the decline path, not the estimator.** `applyWindowedBarLine` returns `beatsPerBar = 1` with empty `downbeats` when every window declines, and `BeatGrid.beatsSinceDownbeat` falls back to `idx % max(beatsPerBar, 1)` — **zero for every beat**. So "no bar information" was encoded as "every beat is bar one": bar-locked events fired four times too often and bar-phase readers got a constant. Session `2026-09-06T00-17-00Z`: **`beatsPerBar == 1` on 18,040 of 19,833 frames (91 %)**, `is_downbeat == 1` on 94 %.

**The default is reverted to OFF.** The mechanism stays behind `UZUME_BARLINE_LOCAL=1` and its measurement stands — take_five decodes 5/4 across 11 of 11 windows and money 7/4, 20 correct and 0 incorrect over 68 labelled windows. What changed is which path is common: the model's downbeat head almost always answered, so the decline encoding was rarely exercised; the windowed estimator declines about two thirds of the time, so it became the norm. Filed as **BUG-117**; the encoding predates PR.17 (FT.4 wrote it) and needs its own increment, because fixing it means deciding what "no bars" looks like on the wire and touching every consumer.

**Two process failures, both mine.** `beatsPerBar = 1` was sitting in the 18:17 session during the BUG-116 investigation, was noted, and was not followed up. And the PR.17 commit asserts a declined track is *"the same shape a track with no detected bars already produces, so consumers need no new case"* — a claim about a specific function, never checked against that function, and false.

**The option Matt accepted was not the option that shipped.** He was asked to choose sparse-versus-dense bars and told sparse meant *"bar-locked events fire correctly in some sections and go quiet in others."* Sparse did not go quiet; it fired on every beat. His answer cannot carry the weight of that outcome.

Dragon Bloom's warm tint and the BUG-116 stem fix are untouched — the first is a look change he has an opinion about rather than a regression, the second is unambiguous.

### [dev-2026-09-05-232010] BUG-116 — the stem series was dead 0.4 s in every 2 s on any non-44.1 kHz local file

Matt, mid-test: *"Now there are issues with Ferrofluid Ocean - screen goes dark every few seconds."* All four stems decayed to exactly 0.000 and snapped back, 68 times in one session, 2.00 s apart, ~0.37 s each. Any stem-driven preset went dark on that rhythm; Ferrofluid Ocean was just the one on screen.

**Root cause — a time base, not a renderer.** `StemSeparator.separate` resamples any input to its own 44.1 kHz and pads to a fixed 440,320 samples, so its output is ALWAYS in the model's time base. `SessionPreparer.analyzeStemSeries` sliced that output at offsets computed in the INPUT's rate. At 48 kHz a 440,320-sample window holds 9.17 s of audio, which resamples to 404,544 samples — and the remaining **35,776 are zero padding**. The function places each kept 2 s span at the window's tail by design, so every read landed squarely in the padding. `DRAWABLE_LIFECYCLE` showed zero failures and zero unpresented frames throughout: the renderer was drawing exactly what it was given.

**Matt's follow-up — "it was not always like this, so something broke" — has two answers.** The code broke at **LFSTEM.1a (2026-08-26)**, which switched local files from live separation, whose slicing is correct, to the pre-analysed series. It became *visible* on 2026-09-05 because of the album: *Low* is 44,100 Hz — the one rate at which input and model rate agree and the defect cannot occur — and Broken Social Scene is 48,000 Hz on all thirteen tracks. Ten days broken, first 48 kHz album played tonight.

**The sibling path had it right all along.** `runPerFrameStemAnalysis` slices the live separator's output with `StemSeparator.modelSampleRate` under a comment citing D-079: *"Stem waveforms are at the model rate, not the tap rate — the separator resamples internally before iSTFT."* The rule was written down one function away.

**Fix.** `StemSeparating` gained `outputSampleRate: Float?` — `nil` means "my output is in the caller's time base", which is what every test double returns; the production separator declares its model rate. `analyzeStemSeries` resamples the input once up front when they differ, which makes the separator's internal resample a no-op and every offset exact. Rate-agnostic, so 88.2 and 96 kHz are covered as well.

| input rate | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| 44,100 | 0 of 1722 near-zero | 0 of 1722 (bit-identical — the branch does not fire) |
| 48,000 | **279 of 1875** | **0 of 1722** |

**Cache invalidated, schema v10 → v11.** The holes are DATA, baked into `stem_series.bin`, so a code fix alone would replay them forever on every already-analysed track. The cost is one re-analysis pass over the cached library.

**Regression parameterised over 44.1 / 48 / 96 kHz**, plus a gate that the frame grid does not depend on the input rate. **Both were run against the un-fixed code and fail there** (48 kHz arm reads silence; grid 258 vs 281 frames) — the adversarial check, not just a green tick. The existing `FixedWindowSeparator` double pads to a fixed window but does not RESAMPLE, so it could never see this; a new `ResamplingWindowSeparator` reproduces the property that matters. Every fixture in the repo is 44.1 kHz, the one rate that proves nothing here.

1915 engine tests green, swiftlint 0. **Outstanding: Matt's live confirmation on a 48 kHz album.** Evidence: `docs/diagnostics/BUG116_STEM_SERIES_HOLES_2026-09-05.md`.

### [dev-2026-09-05-151248] PR.5 — Dragon Bloom's white-out is inverted emptiness, not a missing tone-map

Matt's roster note was *"washed out, extreme brightness… reds look gorgeous, would like the same saturated colour across the visible spectrum."* The scoping hypothesis was a missing tone-map; PR.5's diagnosis increment falsified that (the accumulator is dark and saturated, with no HDR to compress). This increment measured the two levers it left open — **on Matt's own album, through the real `direct + mv_warp` dispatch**.

**Two small instruments first, because no measurement of his material existed.** `FixtureSessionCaptureGenerator` gained `UZUME_GEN_SESSION_AUDIO` so it captures ANY audio file through the production analysis chain rather than only the three vendored tempo fixtures, and `SessionDrivenMultiPassReplay` gained the `REPLAY_OUT` frame dump its own PR.10 usage block had documented and never implemented (plus `REPLAY_W`/`REPLAY_H`). Two *Low* tracks are now real 1290-frame captures, closing PR.5 §4's stated FA #27 bound. Three numbers are not a perception check; the frames are.

**Baseline, confirmed and flat:** 83.6 % of pixels clipped, mean luma 0.909, and clipped never leaves 0.76–0.89 across all 30 s. That is not a fill still developing — `DRAGON_BLOOM_PLAN.md` gives the fill ~20 s — it is a field that reaches a blown-out steady state in about three seconds. The plan named this outcome on 2026-06-01: *"invert-before-fill whited-out."*

**A hypothesis that was open-and-shut on paper and wrong in the render.** The bass breathing is an absolute threshold on AGC-normalised `f.bass` — the exact FA #31 / D-026 pattern — sitting at 1.024 median / 1.070 p90 against a 0.99951 baseline whose own comment says it prevents *"the field draining off-edge / white-collapse."* Routing it to the signed deviation primitive `bass_rel` made things **worse** (clipped 0.836 → 0.868, saturation 0.265 → 0.099): the outward push is the CONVEYOR carrying strand colour out from the centre before the warp transfer's B-fade extinguishes it. Reverted and filed as **BUG-115** rather than fixed — correctness on paper does not outrank what the frame looks like.

**The fix: invert about a warm tint instead of pure white.** `bInvert` is literally `1 - c`, so empty accumulator displays as WHITE, and the frame is mostly empty accumulator — that is the whole report. A first attempt to SUBTRACT from a deep ember gave perfect numbers (clipped 0.000, saturation 0.942, luma 0.487) and a render that flattened the feathering into blocks of flat colour and punched a black lozenge through the middle — FA #48 clipart symmetry, this preset's own named anti-reference. **A metric win, not a product win; rejected on the image, not the table.** Shipping `tint * (1 - c)` instead, monotonic everywhere so the texture survives intact: **clipped 0.836 → 0.361, saturation 0.265 → 0.677, mean luma 0.909 → 0.714**. `UZUME_MVWARP_INVERT_TINT="1,1,1"` reproduces the shipping arm exactly, so the flag is a true no-op at that value, and only presets with `invert > 0` are reachable — Dragon Bloom alone (1911 engine tests green, `PresetRegression` goldens unmoved).

**Not fixed, and said rather than skipped:** the bloom's core is still magenta/teal rather than warm; the bottom two-thirds of the frame carries no feedback texture (a fill-dynamics question, as the falsified arm shows, not a constant to nudge); BUG-115 stays open; and **this preset's reference IMAGES are absent from the repo**, so the trait verdicts are against the README's written traits rather than a side-by-side — weaker than D-181 asks for.

**Dragon Bloom is CERTIFIED and this changes its look, so its certification does not mean anything again until Matt watches it.** He also picks the depth: the shipped `0.95, 0.50, 0.16`, or the deeper `0.80, 0.34, 0.10` (0 % clipped, luma 0.616).

### [dev-2026-09-05-132958] PR.17 — bar position is recorded per window, and local files get it by default

Uzume asked one question per song — *what meter is this, and which beat is the bar line* — and applied the answer to the whole track. It now asks once per ~40 seconds, and **lays bars only where the answer is solid**. Where it isn't, nothing fires: a declined stretch is never backfilled from the model's downbeat head, which over-fires on 78 % of Money's beats. Matt's call between sparse-and-correct and dense-with-fallback (2026-09-05) was **sparse**, and he turned it on the same day after seeing what it does to his own album.

**This reverses FT.2's wiring rejection of 2026-09-04** (*"B is not a viable option"*), whose recorded revisit condition was a materially lower decline rate. Two premises moved. The decline rate was an artifact of the input — every earlier bar measurement (FT.3's calibration, FT.4's A/B, FT.4.1's split, PR.3d's adoption, D-210's decline rate) fed a whole-track estimator ~40–60 beats from a 30 s clamped grid when its own documentation specifies 300–700, and PR.12 removed that clamp. And the granularity changed: a track is no longer all-or-nothing.

**Two meters decode for the first time.** Take Five reads 5/4 across 11 of 11 windows; **Money reads 7/4** — the case four separate levers failed on (TRK.2, DBN.2, MDL.1, FT.1) and the reason BUG-001 and BUG-013 have stayed open. Across 68 labelled windows: **20 correct, 0 incorrect, 44 declined.** Clair de Lune and Pyramid Song stay silent, which is suite 5's stated target rather than a shortfall.

**Five suites, both arms full-track so the spans match** (the scoring artifact PR.12 exposed). Beat F, Cemgil, CMLt and AMLt are **identical on every track** — only `downbeats`/`beatsPerBar`/`barConfidence` move, so suite-1 no-regression holds by construction, not by luck. Downbeat F improves on all five tracks that keep bars: take_five 0.34 → 0.89, money 0.08 → 0.53, bohemian_rhapsody 0.29 → 0.47, billie_jean 0.37 → 0.43, yyz 0.14 → 0.15; mean over the eight scoreable tracks 0.18 → 0.31. **Reported per the claim rules:** solsbury_hill (0.15), bleed (0.09) and clair_de_lune (0.00) lose their downbeats entirely, and solsbury_hill is a genuine 7/4 miss.

**On Bowie's *Low*, measured before recommending** (PR.3d's standing rule, which exists because that increment recommended adoption off nine benchmark fixtures without testing Matt's album): head 5 correct / 5 wrong / 1 collapsed → **5 correct / 0 wrong / 1 unresolved / 5 silent**. It fixes What In The World and removes every wrong bar on the record. **It loses Be My Wife**, which PR.3d identified as the clean counterexample — correct meter and the tightest phase on the album. Art Decade now answers 4/4 on an ambient piece and is recorded as unresolved rather than claimed.

**Costs 0.89 s/track** against D-242's 7.5 s/track budget for all of preparation — ~12 % of the budget for one net-new stage, nearly all of it the front-end (whole-file resample + a per-beat STFT) rather than the windowing. Streaming is untouched: the branch is gated on a whole-track grid, and a 30 s preview is one short window that would only decline.

**Shipped without a live M7.** Every number is offline. Whether bars going quiet mid-song reads as *responsive* or as *flickering* is a felt question nothing has answered yet — `UZUME_BARLINE_LOCAL=0` restores the previous behaviour in one line. Decision: [D-243]. Evidence: `docs/diagnostics/PR17_LOCAL_BARS_2026-09-05.md`.

### [dev-2026-09-03-184358] DS.6 — the playback chrome, retokenized in place (M7 passed)

**Same chrome, made right.** The track card, controls cluster, listening badge, progress dots,
local transport and toasts are the composition they were, drawn from the design system only:
no colour outside the tokens, the Phosphene dashboard palette confined to the diagnostic
dashboard, no `.teal` / `.green` / `.orange`, the transport bar's purple glow replaced by the one
shadow the system publishes. No second control tree.

**Gone after a brief inactivity, back on any input — Matt's call.** After 3 s the chrome
disappears completely so the listener can focus on the visuals. Mouse movement, a tap on the
screen, any key press and a track change bring it all back — the spec promised key and track
change; only the mouse had ever been wired. Space still toggles. The first 3 s now start when the
arrival has faded. State changes take the design system's 240 ms ease-out (was 500 ms); reduced
motion crossfades. A deliberate deviation from the design system's "cannot become undiscoverable",
recorded upstream.

**Show / Hide track info.** A new control in the cluster, the same words the preparation screen
uses, backed by `uzume.settings.visuals.showTrackInformation` (default shown, persisted, also in
Settings beside the preparation-view preference). Hidden means the card, its artwork and the
track-change announcement are gone. The card's "Planned / Reactive" pill is removed (D-241): it
described the session's structure, which the surprise model keeps from the listener.

**Also.** "Still preparing" is now a status placement (info tone). Every chrome control declares a
VoiceOver label and a hint. `Localizable.strings` used lowercase `\uXXXX` escapes, which `.strings`
does not support — the still-preparing tooltip read "weu2019ll"; all fourteen are literal characters now.
**BUG-113** — every toast rendered as a full-window panel inside the chrome (a `Color` accent bar
accepting the whole proposed height); one `.fixedSize` and a layout test.

Review page: `docs/reviews/DS.6/CAPTURES.md` (harness before/after pairs + live window captures).
Findings for the site repo: `docs/reviews/DS.6/UPSTREAM-FINDINGS.md`. Decision: D-241.

### [dev-2026-09-03-152625] DS.5 — Ready becomes the arrival (M7 passed)

**Ready is the payoff of the cave, not a room to wait in.** The aperture the listener watched
widen through preparation is fully open behind the ready screen, and starting the show is the
camera moving into it: the real aperture under a burst of streaks racing outward from the opening,
the screen filling with light, a brief hold, then the first preset already running underneath.
Same push for every source; only the trigger differs.

**Two ready screens.** Streaming keeps a real waiting room — "Ready. Press play in Spotify / Apple
Music.", first-audio detection and the 90 s timeout unchanged — and gains **Begin now**, a bordered
button next to End session that starts without waiting. Local files get no waiting room: a
**3-2-1 count** over the open cave, no app named, no timeout, and the music starts at zero — until
now local audio started in the same instant as `.ready`, and `ContentView` sent local sessions
straight to playback (the ready view it would have shown asked for "your music app").

**The plan preview is gone** — the sheet, the `P` shortcut, "Preview the plan" on the ready screen
and its strings. DS.4's surprise model already ruled it out; this is the increment that executes
that. The pulsing border goes with it.

**Measured.** Flash safety across the whole push in the Mitosis idiom: maxΔ/frame **0.0174**
against the 0.05 gate. Live capture of the built app: `docs/reviews/DS.5/after/`.

**From Matt's first M7 pass (same day).** Ready self-advanced with no audio: the system-audio tap
had only ever been installed after playback began, so the "first audio" detector had always
watched a default value and Ready had always self-advanced a quarter-second in — nobody had
looked at the screen long enough to notice (BUG-112). The tap now comes up at Ready and only what
it actually hears counts. And the copy over the cave now sits on a scrim, not a shadow.

**Design pass + prototype:** `docs/reviews/DS.5/DESIGN.md`. Two prototype rounds were rejected
before the build — a redrawn aperture, then a uniform zoom that read as the light coming out rather
than the viewer going in. Decision: D-240.

### [dev-2026-09-02-160000] DS.4 — the preparation screen becomes the overture (M7 pending)

**The wait is something you watch, and the listener chooses how.** `PreparationProgressView` is
rebuilt in place around two views behind a new preference (`uzume.settings.visuals.preparationView`,
default **mysterious**). The header and the progress bar are gone from both.

**Mysterious — the cave.** A dark frame whose opening is shut until the first track is heard, cracks
to a pinprick, and widens through the engine's four readiness stops. The identity's full prism spills
out of it in every direction, more vibrant as it opens; the playlist changes how the light *behaves*
(churn, rate, edge, ribbing versus wash, waver — from the profiles of tracks already heard), never
its colour. It never names a track. Failures surface as a count line that opens the detailed view.

**Detailed — the list.** Each row reports its stage until the track is heard, then what Uzume
heard — tempo, key, mood, and a four-stem balance mark. Per-row failures stay inline.

**The prerequisite.** `SessionPreparer` now publishes `trackProfiles` beside `trackStatuses`,
written the moment a track becomes `.ready` on every path. Publishing only; analysis order and the
prefetch window are untouched.

**Measured, not asserted.** Flash safety (D-157) in the Mitosis idiom across a scripted 40-track
preparation with a four-track burst: maxΔ/frame **0.0100**, mean luma 0.066–0.511, gate < 0.05.
Preparation wall time on a real 40-track Spotify playlist, cold cache, unmodified build versus each
view: `docs/reviews/DS.4/TIMING.md` — baseline 207.1 s end to end, mysterious 205.7 s, detailed 206.2 s; per-track landing median 3.06 / 3.09 / 3.11 s; every delta inside the noise of the no-preview stalls — no measurable regression in either view.

**DEAD-002 decided.** The banner's never-rendered dismiss button is deleted, not wired: every banner
error either resolves itself or is the only place a still-true condition and its escape are stated.

**Accessibility.** Under reduced motion the cave renders and still widens; it stops animating between
states. To VoiceOver the cave is one element — *"Preparing. N of M tracks heard."* / *"You can start
now"*. No existing identifier changed.

**Evidence for the M7:** `docs/reviews/DS.4/index.html` — before / mysterious / detailed per
reachable state, the live captures, the timing table, the flash numbers, the VoiceOver rows, and a
recording of a full preparation in the mysterious view. Decision: D-238.

### [dev-2026-09-01-195141] DS.2 + COPY-001 — one source tile, and a footer that stopped over-claiming

**DS.2 — `SourceChoice`.** `ConnectorTileView` and the private `LocalSourceActionTile` were two
copies of one tile: same layout, same "Title. Subtitle." accessible label, differing only in hover
behaviour and trailing content. They are now one component carrying four affordances — navigation,
immediate action, unavailable with a reason, unavailable with a recovery action. 118 lines out,
207 in.

**The component owns no state and never constructs a `NavigationLink`.** The `.navigation`
affordance draws the chevron; the consumer wraps it. That is what keeps `connectorPath` on
`ConnectorPickerViewModel` and leaves `AppleMusicConnectionWrapper` /
`OAuthSpotifyConnectionWrapper` holding their view models for their full lifetimes — CA.6-FU-3
exists because rebuilding those orphans in-flight OAuth and auto-retry Tasks. Proven by
`git diff` on the view model returning empty.

**Two behaviour changes, both approved by Matt at the M7.** The connector tiles gained the hover
treatment only the local tiles had; the local tiles gained the VoiceOver hint only the connector
tiles had ("Opens a file chooser"). A Curator using VoiceOver previously got guidance on the first
source screen and silence on the second.

**The M7 measured rather than asserted.** Thirteen matched before/after pairs. Default states are
pixel-identical inside the tile bands; hover changes only the hovered tile's band at maxΔ 14/255 —
exactly `--color-surface-selected` minus `--color-surface-raised`. On `main` the connector tiles
are byte-identical hovered and unhovered. The VoiceOver table was read from the live accessibility
tree of both builds, not derived.

**A prompt gate was wrong and `main` proved it.** Greping `UzumeApp` for the six tile identifier
literals reports three MISSING — identically on unmodified `main`, because the connector three are
interpolated from a prefix and `ConnectorType.rawValue` and have never existed as literals.

**COPY-001 — the picker footer.** Matt caught it on the review page: the footer read *"Uzume reads
what's playing. It doesn't control playback."* directly above a **Local files** tile where Uzume
decodes the audio itself and ships a full transport (stop / previous / play-pause / next). True for
two of three sources, false for the third. Now:

> With Apple Music or Spotify, you press play and Uzume listens. Local files it plays for you.

**The regression test was proven able to fail** before being trusted — restoring the old string
turns all three of `ConnectorPickerFooterTests` red with the actual sentence quoted in the failure.
It guards the unqualified claim returning, not the exact wording.

**Also recorded, not fixed:** **DEAD-001** (`localFolderEnabled` is dead and its comment claims a
v1 gate the shipped build does not have) and **A11Y-001** (the three local tiles announce the
parent view's accessibility identifier rather than their own — pre-existing, identical before and
after).

### [dev-2026-09-01-150000] RN.6 — runtime string identity; Phase RN closes

The last two surfaces RN.2 deliberately refused to touch.

**Persisted `UserDefaults` keys — renamed *with* their migration, in one commit.** RN.2's
stated reason for deferring was exact: renaming these silently resets every user's settings
on the first post-rename launch. That reason is answered rather than ignored. Eleven keys
move to `uzume.*` — the eight `phosphene.settings.*`, plus `lf.recents`,
`onboarding.photosensitivityAcknowledged`, and `cache.localFile.maxBytes` (read by the
engine, migrated by the app: same defaults domain, and the app is the only process that
runs a migration) — each with a matching `SettingsMigrator` entry.

The pre-scheme U.6 key now points **straight** at its `uzume.*` destination instead of
chaining through the intermediate name, so an install that never launched between U.6 and
RN.6 lands correctly in a single pass. No entry depends on another running first, and the
comment says so rather than leaving a silent dependency on array order.

**The migration test was proven able to fail before it was trusted.** Deleting one entry
turns the suite red with `phosphene.lf.recents did not reach uzume.lf.recents — the setting
would silently reset`. A migration test that cannot fail is worse than no test: it certifies
nothing while looking like coverage. App suite 426 → 429.

**Shader comments and preset sidecars — 22 `.metal` comment hits, 5 `.json` fields.** RN.2's
"do not edit shaders or presets" constraint was scoped to that increment; this one opens
under the `preset-session` skill, as CLAUDE.md requires.

**Nothing visual moved, and that is demonstrated rather than claimed.** Two independent
checks: every changed `.metal` line was matched against a comment-marker pattern (zero code
lines changed), and the **preset golden-hash regression suite passes unchanged** — those are
byte-level renders, so any shader behaviour change breaks them. The `PresetLoader` /
`FidelityRubric` / `RouteCoverage` sidecar-schema gates cover the `.json` edits.

Worth naming: the full `preset-session` protocol — contact sheets, per-trait verdict tables,
M7 sign-off — exists for **tuning** increments, where the visual result is the deliverable.
Running it against a comment sweep would have been ceremony. The golden hashes are the
honest gate here and are strictly stronger than a human comparing stills.

**Phase RN is complete.** Repository, tree, targets, packages, module, bundle, metadata,
on-disk data, persisted state, and now shader prose all say Uzume. What remains carrying the
old name is what should: frozen diagnostics and prompts, recorded fixture data, external
artifacts this repo does not own, and the `IdentityMigrator` constants that *are* the
migration.

---

### [dev-2026-08-31-210000] RN.3 — the app repo and uzume-site stop contradicting each other

Two repositories were both describing Uzume and neither said which one was
authoritative. Each had drifted into asserting things the other could disprove.
RN.3 draws the boundary on **verifiability**: `uzume-site` owns brand story,
voice, palette, the First Opening design system, identity assets, naming
research and public copy; this repo owns product behaviour, engineering
decisions, contributor commands, and **whether a claim is true of the shipped
build**. Written into both READMEs. `docs/planning/` here is now a frozen RN.0
snapshot with a header naming the site's copies as live.

**The icon is provably the approved one.** All ten PNGs in
`UzumeApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` are byte-identical (SHA-256) to
`uzume-site`'s `brand/icon/Uzume.iconset/` — no re-export between the approved
First Opening master and the shipped bundle. It just was not written down
anywhere. Now in `docs/CREDITS.md` §App icon with the re-verification command,
and in the site's `ARTIFACTS.md` with the digests.

**Five claims were false; three were the site's, two were ours.**

Site-ward: its planning docs still carried the **pre-2026-08-12 domain call** —
uzume.app "available and canonical", and a bundle ID of `app.uzume.mac` —
against registrar ground truth (uzume.app registered and parked, **uzume.io**
canonical, shipped `io.uzume.mac`). "Certified presets are measured at **0
flashes per second**" has no basis in this repo at all; the real gate is D-157
steady luminance, a bounded max per-frame brightness change, and the figure had
reached four separate published surfaces. And "free, open-source **public
beta**" describes a repository that is not public, with no signed or notarized
build (CLEAN.2.5b is blocked on a paid Apple Developer membership).

App-ward, and the more interesting half: **the README explained the wrong
word.** Its second paragraph read "The name references the phenomenon of
perceiving light and patterns without external visual stimulus" — a correct
gloss of *phosphene*, left attached to the name *Uzume* by RN.2's sweep. This is
a **new variant** of D-227's dictionary-word hazard: the sentence contains no
`Phosphene` token, so no lexical residual scan could ever find it. Only reading
the prose for meaning catches a **semantic orphan** — a sentence whose subject
was renamed out from under it. Replaced with the Ame-no-Uzume story as `BRAND.md`
tells it. Second: the **"AI orchestrator"** framing, which the site retired as a
product claim, survived in README and CLAUDE.md — the session planner is
deterministic and rules-based (D-034); ML does stem separation, beat tracking and
mood classification, none of which plan anything.

**Two stale contributor instructions, both first-contact.** The README told new
contributors to install `git-lfs` *before cloning* or receive stub files —
untrue since D-211 (`git lfs ls-files` returns zero). `PUBLISHING.md` still said
"LFS keeps reference media only."

**Divergence, not staleness.** The duplicated planning docs had drifted in
*opposite* directions: this repo held the corrected domain facts, the site held
the newer retirement of the AI framing. Neither copy was wholly authoritative, so
RN.3 merged them and then designated a single owner — rather than declaring a
winner and losing half the corrections.

**Not done, deliberately:** no website architecture was invented. There is no
Astro app, no marketing pages, no OG/manifest surface, so none was created. The
design system's "Download the beta" specimens stay — they are component
placeholders, and `catalogue.js` already models the honest unavailable state ("A
signed and notarized build has not been published yet"). Public wording for an
unreleased app is Matt's call; the closeout lists the pending picks.

**Evidence:** this repo — `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` ALL GREEN. `uzume-site`
@ `03d5478` — JS syntax checks, catalogue-reference gate (7 pages), contrast gate
(60 pairings), and the SwiftUI package suite all pass. Both branches are local
and unpushed.

---

### [dev-2026-08-31-180000] RN.2 — the internal tree becomes Uzume

RN.1 renamed what the user sees; RN.2 renames what a contributor sees. Directories, Xcode
targets and scheme, Swift packages and products, the app's Swift module, the test host and
bundle, env vars, scripts, CI, hooks, skills and every living doc now say Uzume.
`PhospheneApp/`→`UzumeApp/`, `PhospheneEngine/`→`UzumeEngine/`, `PhospheneTools/`→`UzumeTools/`,
`PhospheneAppTests/`→`UzumeAppTests/`, `PhospheneApp.xcodeproj`→`UzumeApp.xcodeproj`,
`Phosphene.xcconfig`→`Uzume.xcconfig`, `PhospheneToast`→`UzumeToast`, `PHOSPHENE_*`→`UZUME_*`,
`phosphene.view.*`→`uzume.*`. The generic modules (`Audio`, `DSP`, `ML`, `Renderer`, `Presets`,
`Orchestrator`, `Session`, `Shared`, `Diagnostics`) were never branded and did not move.

**`PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME` was repointed, not unpinned.** D-225 pinned it to `PhospheneApp` so RN.1
could ship the visible rename alone. Deleting the pin would let the module follow `PRODUCT_NAME`,
which is `Uzume` — giving a module named `Uzume` inside a target named `UzumeApp`. Setting it to
`UzumeApp` keeps module, target and directory one name and leaves `PRODUCT_NAME = Uzume` and the
shipped bundle untouched. Built products verified: `Uzume.app`, executable `Uzume`,
`UzumeAppTests.xctest`, `UzumeApp.swiftmodule`.

**Two user-visible strings RN.1 missed** turned up here and are fixed: the About-box version line
read `Phosphene <version>`, and the multi-display toast offered to "Move Phosphene there".

**Four surfaces deliberately still say `phosphene`,** each for a reason, not by oversight:
persisted `UserDefaults` keys (renaming resets every user's settings — that is a `SettingsMigrator`
job, not a structural rename); the on-disk output paths `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/` and
friends (renaming orphans every captured session and every documented diagnostic command against
them — and it is user-visible, so it is Matt's call); `IdentityMigrator`'s legacy `com.phosphene.*`
constants (they *are* the RN.1 migration); and `.metal` comments plus preset `.json` descriptions
(excluded by RN.2's own "do not edit shaders or presets" constraint). All four are RN.3's named
scope. Full reasoning in D-227.

**The sweep introduced three defects; the suite caught one, a manual audit caught two — worth
recording because each is reusable.** (1) The test-side persisted-key literals were renamed while
production kept them, and three app tests went red. The *same* defect landed silently in the
RUNBOOK as a `defaults write io.uzume.mac uzume.cache.localFile.maxBytes` that would have quietly
done nothing — no test covers a documented shell command. (2) A blanket prose replace falsified
history in three places: `docs/planning/` (RN.0's preserved naming evidence) became "the Uzume →
Uzume rename", "another open-source macOS app named Uzume", "uzumes are all entoptic phenomena",
and a rewritten **third-party** URL; five verbatim quotations were rewritten, two attributed to
Matt by name; and D-225's own record of RN.1 stopped describing RN.1. (3) A RUNBOOK warning about
stale pre-rename incantations **inverted its meaning** — the sweep renamed the very names it warns
are dead. All reverted. The rule that falls out: a brand sweep may rewrite paths, commands and
identifiers anywhere, but never the inside of a quotation, a third-party proper noun, or a sentence
that narrates the rename — and "phosphene" is a dictionary word, so a scan for the common-noun
sense is mandatory before trusting the result.

**Evidence** (`Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` @ `8c35740c`): engine 1873 tests / 291 suites, app 426
tests / 74 suites, SwiftLint 0 violations in 518 files, doc gates 13/13, `check_user_strings.sh` and
`check_sample_rate_literals.sh` pass — ALL GREEN. Separately, a clean `git archive` export of the
tracked tree resolves both packages, builds both, and lists targets `UzumeApp`/`UzumeAppTests` with
schemes `UzumeApp`/`UzumeEngine`; every `PBXFileReference` path resolves.

**One-time cost on every existing checkout:** `UzumeEngine/.build` and `UzumeTools/.build` carry
absolute paths from the old directory name and must be deleted; DerivedData re-hashes to a new
`UzumeApp-*` directory; and `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` cannot serve a worktree until `main` itself
carries the rename. RUNBOOK §After the Uzume rename (RN.2) has the steps.

### [dev-2026-08-31-142005] BUG111.1 — the first-run permission card was a dead end

**The Screen Recording onboarding card could not lead to a grant on any machine that had never
granted capture.** macOS adds an app to Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording only
after the app calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`. The single call site was `startAudio()`
(`VisualizerEngine+PublicAPI.swift:56`), and `ContentView`'s permission gate sits above the
session-state switch — so the card's "Open System Settings" deep link opened a pane the app was
absent from, and the code path that would have registered it was behind the card. Closed loop.
Fresh install, `tccutil reset ScreenCapture`, or the RN.1 bundle-ID change (`com.phosphene.app` →
`io.uzume.mac`, which orphaned the old grant) all land in it. Matt hit the third on 2026-08-31.

**U.2's "never prompt" rule was right for the case it was written for and wrong for this one.**
`63908e94` (2026-04-22) chose preflight + URL scheme because "the request API's system dialog
doesn't compose with 'Open System Settings and return'" — which assumes the app is already listed.
It is not, on first run. (The rationale dates from U.2, not U.11; verified against the introducing
commit rather than the comment's own claim.)

**Fix:** the card's primary CTA is now **"Allow Access"** and calls `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`,
which registers the app and shows the OS dialog. The deep link survives as a secondary link
("Already allowed it? Open System Settings") for the already-denied case, where macOS suppresses the
dialog but the app *is* listed. Deliberately stateless — no "have we asked yet" flag, no branch —
so the card is actionable in every TCC state and there is nothing to go stale.
`SystemScreenCapturePermissionProvider` is unchanged and still never prompts; it is the passive
probe `PermissionMonitor` polls, and its header now says that instead of restating the retired
rationale.

**Files:** `PhospheneApp/Views/Onboarding/PermissionOnboardingView.swift`,
`PhospheneApp/Permissions/ScreenCapturePermissionProvider.swift` (comment),
`PhospheneApp/en.lproj/Localizable.strings` (+`onboarding.permission.grant`, reworded
`open_settings`), `PhospheneAppTests/PermissionOnboardingViewTests.swift`.

**Evidence:** app build green; app suite **421/421** in 73 suites; `swiftlint --strict` 0 violations
in 516 files; `Scripts/check_user_strings.sh` PASS.

**Not resolved yet.** This is a UX-flow change, so the defect skill mandates a manual walk:
`tccutil reset ScreenCapture <bundle id>` → relaunch → **Allow Access** → dialog appears → app is
listed → toggling it on auto-advances past the card with no relaunch. Only Matt can run that.
The instrumentation and diagnosis increments were collapsed into the fix (root cause established
from source + his live observation; nothing left to instrument) — **Matt approved the collapse in
chat, 2026-08-31**.

---
### [dev-2026-08-31-133921] RN.1 — the app is Uzume everywhere macOS looks

The external rename landed. Bundle ID `com.phosphene.app` → **`io.uzume.mac`**, product
`PhospheneApp.app` → **`Uzume.app`**, URL scheme `uzume://`, Keychain `io.uzume.spotify`,
loggers `io.uzume.*`, Application Support `Uzume/`, repo `hoaxpoet/uzume`. The app finally has
an icon — there was no asset catalog in the project at all before this. Internal module,
target and scheme names are untouched; that is RN.2. Full mapping and rationale in D-225.

**The menu bar needed the product rename, not just a plist key.** `CFBundleName` drives the
macOS app menu and is injected from `PRODUCT_NAME` — setting it in `Info.plist` or via
`INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleName` was verified to do nothing. `PRODUCT_NAME = Uzume` fixes it and
also renames the Swift module, which broke every `@testable import PhospheneApp`;
`PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME` pins the module so the visible rename lands without dragging the module
rename in early.

**A Keychain migration froze app launch, and cost most of the session.** Adopting the
pre-rename Spotify token looked obviously right — the user should not have to reconnect. But
reading an item written by a different code identity makes securityd raise a modal
`SecurityAgent` prompt, and `SecItemCopyMatching` blocks on it. The store is built from a
stored-property initializer, which runs before `init()`'s body, so the app wedged before doing
anything and `xcodebuild test` failed with "The test runner hung before establishing
connection" — a symptom that looks nothing like its cause. Reverted; the user reconnects once.

The diagnosis is the reusable part. Four theories died first (the state migrator, LaunchServices
registration, stale DerivedData, TCC), each disproved rather than argued: running the base
commit in the same worktree proved the fault was ours, a bundle-ID bisect narrowed it to one
commit, and `sample` on the wedged process named the blocking frame outright. **Sampling the
hung process should have been step one, not step five.**

`IdentityMigrator` carries the settings domain and the Application Support tree across the
identity change — idempotent, existing values win, failures logged and swallowed. Verified on
real data: 263 MB of stem cache relocated correctly.

Also: BUG-072's runbook remedy was itself stale and silently matched nothing after the rename
(`pkill -x PhospheneApp` against a process now named `Uzume`), which wasted a diagnostic round.
Now addressed by bundle id.

### [dev-2026-08-27-153500] PERF.17 — the frame-budget harness was timing the roster at the AGC mean

BUG-110's follow-up asked for "a note or a mechanism for state-gated layers" in the frame-budget
harness. The mechanism already existed for Fractal Tree; the finding was that the defect is not
Skein-shaped.

**The shared drive built every band at exactly `0.5` and left every `Rel`/`Dev` field zero.**
`bassRel = (bass − 0.5) × 2` is zero at 0.5 by construction, and `StemFeatures` derives nothing in
its initialiser — so the whole roster was timed at the one point where **D-026's deviation
primitives, the default primary driver for every preset, are identically zero**.

Skein shows what that costs. Its pour-commit machine never committed a second pour, so the
breakpoint ring held **1** where playback holds 16 and `skein_geometry_fragment` skipped most of
Layer A. Skein read **5.31 ms — the cheapest third of the roster** — against 17.06 ms at one
breakpoint and 55.65 ms at sixteen in `SkeinLineCostTests`.

**Now:** the bands sweep 0.20–0.95 with Rel/Dev derived by the analyzer's own formula (a hand-set
`bassDev` beside a disagreeing `bass` is its own trap), sized against real material's p99 ≈ 0.85
rather than against 1.0; stem dominance rotates on a ~1 s cycle with a decisive leader, because an
argmax route reads fixed dominance as "nothing ever changed"; and `warmSkein` ticks the state to a
full ring before the timed frames, stopping on the ring rather than a frame count so it survives a
`minPourTau` retune.

**Skein 5.31 → 13.19 ms, 4th most expensive preset.** `skeinIsMeasuredMidPainting` gates it with a
COLD control — a fresh state still holds 1 breakpoint after the 24 timed frames — so deleting the
warm-up goes red instead of both halves passing vacuously.

All 21 baselines re-recorded in one isolated run. **Several moved DOWN** (Nebula/Plasma/Waveform
9.5 → 6.3): a band sweeping 0.2–0.95 is not the same work as one pinned at 0.5, and the old figure
was no more correct for being higher. Nothing tripped the ratio gate or the absolute ceiling.

### [dev-2026-08-27-185933] LFSTEM.2 — live separation retired on tracks that have a series

**Complete — and the payoff is not the one this was justified by; see the measurement below.** A track
with a pre-analysed series had no use for
live separation — `runPerFrameStemAnalysis` already stood down for it at LFSTEM.1c — so a 142 ms
MPSGraph job was running every 2 s on the same GPU the renderer draws with, and its output was
computed and discarded. `separationSupersededBySeries()` now skips the dispatch.

**The gate is on the SERIES, never on the source.** "Is this a local file" would strand a cache
miss, a schema mismatch or a failed analysis with no stems at all: those leave the series empty
and keep the live path exactly as it was. The wiring test asserts the condition, not just the
call.

**The three consumers, checked before removing anything** — the spec named them so this would
start from a list rather than a grep:

- **The per-frame analyser** — already standing down since LFSTEM.1c. Replaced.
- **`chain_health.json` / the ASH monitors — clear, with evidence.** `ChainAnalyzer` contains
  **zero** stem references; `SignalHealthMonitor` has six and all are sample-rate comments, over
  raw tap samples rather than stems. Neither can read "no separations happening" as a fault, so
  the BUG-070 shape — a health monitor reporting a deliberately-stopped pipeline as dead — is not
  reachable here.
- **The `stems/` WAV dump is LOST on tracks with a series, and the log says so.** It is written
  from live separation output, and there is no substitute that means the same thing:
  `CachedTrackData.stemWaveforms` holds only the track's first ~10 s, so dumping it would label
  the intro as though it were the passage being played. `STEM_SOURCE: live separation SUPPRESSED
  for this track (LFSTEM.2) — no stems/ WAV dump` now appears at track change. To listen to
  separation quality on a local file: play one whose series is absent, or use the streaming path.

Suppressions are counted into `GPU_PRESSURE` as `stem_suppressed`, so a session shows zero
`STEM_SEPARATION` lines against a rising count — the saving measured rather than asserted.

**The before/after** (`2026-08-27T19-51-09Z` against `2026-08-27T18-17-50Z` — same file, same preset,
same 3840×2160). The suppression itself is exactly as designed: zero `STEM_SEPARATION` lines,
`stem_suppressed` climbing 1 → 56 over 110 s, `ml_last=none`, no `stems/` directory.

⚠ **The frame-time saving did not appear.** `frame_gpu_ms` p50 **12.95 → 13.96 ms**, `frame_cpu_ms` p50
**26.93 → 28.11 ms** — the wrong direction, and within session-to-session variance (p90 15.04 → 15.10 ms).
Removing a 142 ms job every 2 s did not move the median frame, because MPSGraph dispatches on its own
queue and BUG-110 had already left ~3.7 ms of headroom for it to interleave into. That prediction is
recorded as wrong rather than quietly dropped.

**What did move: the GPU working set is flat at 474 MB (3.9 %) where it climbed 549 → 586 MB before** —
the eviction dimension BUG-100 named. Hitches over 33 ms fell 0.17/s → 0.08/s, but that is 15 frames
against 8 and is not enough to claim. The increment stands on the working set, the dead compute, and
removing BUG-086's latency class by mechanism.

### [dev-2026-08-27-182236] M7 PASSED — LFSTEM.1 complete, BUG-110/108/109 closed

**Matt, session `2026-08-27T18-17-50Z`: *"Looks good."*** 106 s of Skein at 3840×2160 — well past
the 70–80 s mark where the round-1 overlap residual appeared — with the series driving
(`STEM_SOURCE: series frames=10815`), sampling at **58.3 Hz**, and `frame_gpu` p50 flat at
**12.08–13.76 ms**.

That sign-off closes three defects and completes the increment they hung off:

- **BUG-108** — the overlap flicker, fixed in two rounds. Round 1: which MARK wins an overlap was
  a coverage argmax. Round 2: the same argmin one level down, inside the line, where the colour
  came from the nearest segment. Matt's round-1 report — *"only after 70–80 s and not as
  prominent"* — located the residual rather than refuting the fix, which is why round 2 took one
  pass.
- **BUG-109** — stem values updated 12.8 times a second because the series was sampled on the
  analysis frame. Now sampled per render frame: 56–58 Hz measured live.
- **BUG-110** — Skein's 4K cost ramp, from a fragment recomputing the painter's whole 41-sample
  tail per pixel. 38 → 250 ms before, flat ~13 ms now.

**LFSTEM.1 is complete.** For a local file, stems are analysed ahead of time, arrive at the
playback second they describe rather than 2.5 s late, and move at the series' own rate rather than
the analysis loop's. It took four corrections after the first "done" — on time (1c), continuous
(1d r1), non-rewinding (1d r2), full-rate (1e) — and every one was found by a session artifact
rather than a test.

**LFSTEM.2 is unblocked** (retire live separation on the local path), which was gated on this M7.

§Open is back to 20 entries; BUG-100/103/104 rotate to history to keep §Resolved inside its 50 KB
budget. ⚠ BUG-103 was moved to history by mistake during that rotation and restored — it is an
OPEN entry (a parallel session's `AVAudioPlayerNode` NSException), not a resolved one, and the
§Open Index gate is what caught it.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-180020] BUG-108 round 2 — the same argmin, one level down, inside the line

**Matt on the round-1 build:** *"Flickering still happens but only after significant time has
passed (70-80 s) and is not as prominent as before. Frame rate is smooth."*

Round 1 fixed which **mark** wins an overlap. Inside the pour line, the colour was still taken
from the **nearest segment** — `if (d < lineSDF) { … lineCol = … }` — the same argmin one level
down. Two segments of DIFFERENT pours that are near-equidistant from a fragment flip the winner on
sub-pixel motion, and the flip is a full colour swap.

**Both halves of the report fall out of that.** *Less prominent*, because the mark-level case was
genuinely fixed and only the line-internal one remained. *Only after 70–80 s*, because such pairs
need differently-coloured segments inside the same 40-frame tail, and colour breakpoints
accumulate over a track — the same ring whose filling drove BUG-110's cost ramp. A report that
locates a residual is worth more than one that just says "still broken", and this one located it.

The line now takes the colour of the **first covering segment in a newest→oldest walk** — the
latest-laid one by construction, no comparison, nothing to jitter. Coverage still comes from the
nearest segment (`lineSDF = min(lineSDF, d)`); fragments no segment covers keep the nearest
colour, because nothing is laid over anything in the anti-aliased fringe. `SkeinCanvasHoldTest`
now gates both levels: no colour selection by coverage at the mark level, and none by distance
inside the line.

**Also confirmed by the same session, both LFSTEM.1e and BUG-110 live:** the series samples at
**~56 Hz** (was 12.8 — LFSTEM.1e), `STEM_SOURCE` reports the series driving, and `frame_gpu` p50
holds **12.55–13.21 ms flat across 90 s** at 4K. Matt: *"Frame rate is smooth."*

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-170716] LFSTEM.1e — the series is sampled per render frame, not per analysis frame

**Matt's call on BUG-109's fix.** Stem motion was capped at the analysis rate — **12.8 Hz measured**
— while the renderer drew at 59.9 Hz and the series' own grid is 43 Hz. Live separation had to
publish on the analysis frame because it had nothing new between them; a pre-analysed series is an
array lookup and has no such bound. `publishStemSeriesFrame` now runs once per RENDER frame from a
dedicated `RenderPipeline.perFrameStemPublish` hook.

Three details decide whether this works rather than merely runs:

- **It publishes BEFORE the frame snapshots its stems.** `renderFrame` reads `latestStemFeatures`
  once and that snapshot serves the particles update, the preset tick and the draw — publishing
  after it would land a frame late, the off-by-one-frame class this whole arc has been about.
  `StemSeriesWiringTests` asserts the ordering in the source, not just the presence of the call.
- **It is a separate hook from `meshPresetTick`.** That slot is owned by whichever preset needs
  per-frame state — Skein sets it for its painter clock — and one closure cannot serve both.
- **The analysis frame no longer samples.** It publishes only the playback clock the render frame
  samples with, so the smoother is touched from one thread instead of two, behind `stemSeriesLock`.
  `applyStemSeriesFrame` is deleted rather than left sitting beside its replacement.

**What is now true end to end for a local file:** stems are analysed ahead of time, arrive at the
playback second they describe rather than 2.5 s late, and move at the series' own 43 Hz instead of
the analysis loop's 13.

⚠ **Still owed: Matt's eye.** Every change in this chain moved what stem-driven presets see, and
none of it is settled by a test. Skein is the instrument.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-165948] BUG-109 answered — the series is read 13 times a second while the renderer draws 60

**The instruments worked; the answer was neither candidate.** Session `2026-08-27T16-53-29Z`:
`STEM_SOURCE: series frames=10815 covers=251.1s hop=23.2ms`, and `stem_series_pos_s` populated on
**100 %** of rows with **0 backward steps** — so the series is installed, driving, and the
smoother is being reached and working. But it takes only **1,398 distinct values over 6,521 rows**:

| | rate |
|---|---|
| `features.csv` rows | 59.9 Hz |
| distinct sampling positions | **12.8 Hz** |
| the series' own grid | 43 Hz |

**Two facts.** `features.csv` has one row per RENDER frame — `SessionRecorder.recordFrame` is
"record one rendered frame", called from the command-buffer completion handler — so the 79 % of
rows where the position repeats is the recorder holding between analysis frames, not a stuck
position. And the series is sampled **once per analysis frame**, at 12.8 Hz, while the renderer
draws at 60. Stem values change ~13 times a second; a preset at 60 fps holds each one for ~4.6
frames.

**The fix is available only because of LFSTEM.1, and has not been spent.** Live separation could
not publish faster than analysis frames — there was nothing new to publish. A pre-analysed series
has no such bound: sampling it is an array lookup. Moving `applyStemSeriesFrame` to the render
frame turns 12.8 Hz into the series' full 43 Hz. Not implemented — it changes what every
stem-driven preset sees.

⚠ **A correction this session forced, to something already published.** BUG110.3 recorded that
"the analysis loop now runs at 59.9 Hz where pre-fix local sessions ran at ~18 Hz, so part of
BUG-087's ceiling was the GPU starving the loop". **That is wrong** — both were RENDER rates
(18 fps pre-fix, consistent with 170–250 ms frames; 60 fps after). The analysis rate was never
measured that way and **BUG-087's ceiling claim is untouched**. Reading a row rate as an analysis
rate is the same class of mistake as reading a metric by its name, which this project has now
made often enough to have a rule about it. Retracted in the BUG-110 entry rather than quietly
edited away.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-163000] BUG-109 instrumented — the session artifact can now answer which source drives the stems

**Instrumentation only. No sampling behaviour changed** — deliberately, because BUG-109's own note
says not to touch it until the artifact says what is happening.

Two additions, together enough for one local-file session to settle it:

- **`stem_series_pos_s`**, the tail column of `features.csv`: the position the stem series was
  sampled at, *after* `PlaybackClockSmoother`. `playback_time_s` carries the RAW clock, so it
  could not distinguish "the series is driving and its position advances" from "the series is
  driving and its position is stuck" — which is why BUG-109 had to be inferred by counting
  distinct stem values rather than read off.
- **`STEM_SOURCE:`** in `session.log` at track change — `series frames=N covers=Xs hop=Yms`, or
  `live separation (no series for this track)`. This existed only in `os.Logger`, so no session
  artifact could answer it. A per-track fact that changes what every stem-driven preset reads
  belongs in the artifact.

The new column is the first OPTIONAL one, which is the single shape that can align when populated
and shift every later field when absent. `SessionRecorderCSVAlignmentTests` checks both forms and
asserts the empty case reads as genuinely empty rather than as a number; dropping the separator
instead of the value fails it (77 fields against 78, and the last field reading `0.00000`).

**What the next session answers.** If `stem_series_pos_s` advances every frame while stem values
hold, the sampling is fine and the values are not coming from where they should. If the position
itself holds, the smoother is not being reached. If the column is empty throughout, no series was
installed and live separation was driving all along — in which case LFSTEM.1's headline claim has
not been exercised live yet at all.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-162253] BUG-110 confirmed live — Skein at 4K is flat at ~12.6 ms, and a new question is filed

**Confirmed.** Session `2026-08-27T16-17-34Z`, Skein at 3840×2160 for 78 s:

| t (s) | 0 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frame_gpu` p50 | 12.59 | 12.62 | 12.48 | 13.10 | 12.23 | 11.55 |

Flat, mildly decreasing, against **38 → 127 → 170–250 ms** in both pre-fix sessions. The ramp is
gone and the plateau is ~14× cheaper. `GPU_PRESSURE` 4.6–4.8 %, `ml_forced=0`, thermal nominal.

**Second-order effect worth recording:** the analysis loop now runs at **59.9 Hz** where the
pre-fix local sessions ran at ~18 Hz. Part of what looked like BUG-087's local-path analysis-rate
ceiling was the GPU starving the loop at 170–250 ms per frame. It does not close BUG-087 — the
audio-arrival ceiling is a separate claim — but any rate measured on a GPU-bound session is
suspect. What remains is not GPU-bound either: `frame_cpu` p50 ~28.5 ms (≈35 fps) against a
12.6 ms GPU, so the rest is in the wall-clock path, not the shader this fixed.

**Filed, not guessed at: BUG-109.** The same session says something about the stem series that
does not add up. Over 4,620 analysis frames: the raw 100 ms clock takes **1,010** distinct values,
the 23.2 ms series offers **~3,360** frames, and `drumsEnergyDev` takes **634**. Stem values change
*less often than the clock ticks* — which rules the smoother out rather than in, since it is
monotone and resyncs on every tick, and replaying this session's own clock through it predicts a
new series index on ~70 % of frames with 0 backward and 0 rewound. So either the smoothed position
is not reaching `StemFeatureSeries.sample`, or `stems.csv` is not carrying what the series
produced. Both are wiring questions; neither is established.

⚠ **The reason it took a session to notice is an instrumentation gap I introduced and had already
flagged once:** the "series installed" line goes to `os.Logger` rather than the session log, and
the smoothed position is not recorded at all. The next move is to put both in the artifact and
run one local-file session — **not** to change sampling behaviour before the artifact says what is
happening.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-160607] BUG-110 fixed — Skein recomputed the painter's whole tail for every pixel

**The hoist.** `skeinLineLookupAt` and `skeinPainterPos` depend only on the painter clock, the seed
phases and the breakpoint ring — **never on fragment position** — and both were being recomputed
for all 41 tail samples of every one of 8.3 M fragments: ~246 transcendentals per fragment from
the painter path alone, ~2 billion per 4K frame, plus a ring scan up to 16 long per sample.
`SkeinState.resolveTail` now produces those 41 samples once per frame into a `SkeinTailGPU` table
and the fragment reads it.

| `breakCount` | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (layer gated off) | 0.75 ms | 0.87 ms |
| 1 | **17.06 ms** | **4.77 ms** — 3.6× |
| 4 | 27.36 ms | 4.58 ms |
| **16** (ring cap) | **55.65 ms** | **3.67 ms** — 15× |

The `breakCount` dependence — the ramp's mechanism — is gone. The curve is now flat and mildly
*decreasing*: more pours mean more skipped bridge segments and so fewer segment-distance
evaluations. What remains is the tail's own 40 SDF evaluations, which genuinely depend on the
fragment.

**Correctness, because speed proves nothing here.** The hoist replaces a per-fragment computation
with a per-frame table, so its failure mode is a table that is mis-offset, mis-strided or stale —
none of which the cost numbers would reveal, since a garbage table costs the same to read.
`hoistedTailDrawsInTheRightPlace` renders the marks at a known painter state and asserts the paint
lands on the painter's own path; an 8-byte offset drift moves the centroid from 0.65 to 0.99 and
the test goes red. It runs unconditionally, not behind the cost harness's env gate.

The harness stopped hand-mirroring GPU struct layouts in the process — it now uses the real
`SkeinHeaderGPU` / `SkeinBreakGPU` / `SkeinTailGPU` and fills the tail through the production
resolver, so a layout change cannot drift the test away from the code silently.

⚠ **Live confirmation is owed.** The marks overlay is one of several passes; the ~170 ms live
figure also carries the base pass, warp, comp/sheen and presentation. A 4K Skein session is what
says how much of the ramp this removed.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-154702] BUG-110 diagnosed — the frame-budget harness has been measuring Skein with its most expensive layer switched off

**Diagnosis, not a fix.** BUG-110 held that Skein costs 15.60 ms at 4K in `PresetFrameBudgetTests`
and ~170 ms live. `SkeinLineCostTests` (`PHOSPHENE_SKEIN_COST=1`) binds a **synthetic
`SkeinUniforms`** — no audio, no `SkeinState`, just bytes — and times the real marks overlay at
3840×2160. That is the seam Skein has never had, and it settles both halves:

| `breakCount` | marks overlay @ 4K |
|---|---|
| **0** | **0.75 ms** ← what the harness binds |
| 1 | **17.06 ms** |
| 4 | 27.36 ms |
| **16** (ring cap) | **55.65 ms** |

**The harness measures the layer switched off.** Skein's whole pour-line layer sits behind
`if (int(st.breakCount) > 0)`, and `PresetFrameBudgetTests` binds a zeroed slot-6 buffer: no
committed pour, no line, no paint. 0.75 ms against 17.06 ms the moment one breakpoint exists. The
"15.60 ms, 0.8× the median preset" that made Skein look like one of the cheapest in the roster was
the base pass and overhead. **This is the harness's blind spot, not Skein's fact** — any preset
whose expensive work is gated on runtime state the harness leaves zeroed reads the same way, and
that is worth a note in the harness itself.

**The ramp is the breakpoint ring filling.** `skeinLineLookupAt` runs once per tail frame
(`kSkeinTailFrames = 40`) per fragment and scans the ring (up to 16). As a track accumulates
dominant-stem switches the scan lengthens: 17.06 → 55.65 ms, then a plateau at the cap. That is
ramp-to-plateau at constant resolution and constant preset — the live shape, reproduced offline.
Worst case is 40 × 16 = **640 scan iterations per fragment**, at 8.3 M fragments.

**The fix is a hoist.** `skeinLineLookupAt(ctau, st)` depends only on the tail's painter-clock
values and the uniform ring — **not on fragment position**. All 40 lookups are fragment-invariant
and are being recomputed 8.3 M times per frame. Resolving them once per frame removes the
per-fragment scan and the `breakCount` dependence outright. Not implemented here.

⚠ **Two corrections worth keeping.** The canvas-coverage theory in the original entry was
**wrong** — the comp pass's wetness blur, gradient and specular are unconditional per-pixel work,
constant regardless of paint. And the first version of this harness timed `skein.pipelineState`
(the base direct pass) rather than the marks overlay, reporting **0.34 ms flat at 4K for every
breakpoint count**; a number that uniform, that fast, at that resolution, says only "this is not
the shader that draws the paint".

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-151310] BUG-108 fixed — at a Skein overlap, the last-laid mark wins

**Matt's call: (a), the lay-order tie-break.**

Skein composites marks opaquely on purpose — the §colour-mud audit rejected averaging two stem
colours — but the rule for WHICH colour was `if (cov > bestCover)`: whichever mark covers this
fragment most. That is a hard argmax with no tie-break, and its decision boundary is the contour
where two marks' coverage is equal. On that contour the winner was decided by whatever was
smallest in the frame — sub-pixel painter motion, the audio-driven per-frame radius, a difference
in the sixth decimal — and because the rule is discrete, every flip was a full colour swap.
Flicker at overlaps was what the rule did by construction.

`skeinClaimMark` replaces it with what paint does: **the mark laid last wins**. Lay time is
`spawnTau` for a burst and the nearest drawn segment's painter clock for the pour line — both
frozen at lay time, in the same clock, neither jittering frame to frame. Coverage still supplies
the alpha (unchanged, a max over marks), and the old argmax survives only as the fringe fallback
where nothing covers a fragment by more than half: two anti-aliased edges have no laid-over
relationship, and those fragments read as canvas anyway. **No blending is introduced**, so the
mud rule is untouched.

⚠ **The perception check is owed, and is not being quietly dropped.** BUG-108's own criterion was
a rendered A/B at a known overlap showing the boundary stable across frames. That cannot be
produced with the seams that exist: `SkeinState` spawns bursts from audio, so two overlapping
bursts of known colour at a known position cannot be staged, and no offline harness renders
Skein's marks. ⚠ **The `PresetRegressionTests` Skein goldens are unchanged, and that is NOT
evidence of anything** — the golden is `0x8080808080808080`, a uniform hash of one frame rendered
with no `SkeinState` bound, so the harness paints no marks for this change to affect. Building
that seam is its own increment; until then the verification is Matt's M7.

What is gated automatically is the property rather than the arithmetic: `SkeinCanvasHoldTest` now
fails if any site selects an overlap colour by a coverage comparison again, if a mark bypasses
`skeinClaimMark`, or if the claim stops deciding on lay time. A frozen quantity cannot jitter, so
a boundary decided by lay time cannot flicker — and if the argmax comes back, the flicker comes
back with it and the gate goes red.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-144324] LFSTEM.1d round 2 — the smoother itself rewound the position

**Matt: *"Improved, but I'm still seeing some flickering in the areas of overlap between two
different-colors lines."* Three findings from session `2026-08-27T14-33-03Z`, one fixed here and
two filed.**

**Fixed: the smoother rewound.** Round 1 treated every tick of the coarse clock as an outright
resync. Dead reckoning legitimately runs tens of milliseconds past a tick before the tick that
confirms it arrives, so snapping back to the raw value moved the playback position **backwards**.
Replayed against the clock recorded in Matt's session: **27 of 1,871 frames went backwards, by up
to 74 ms — 3.2 series frames** — so stem values re-read frames they had already passed, several
times a minute.

The position is now kept inside a band that follows the clock: never behind it, never more than
`maxDeadReckonSeconds` ahead, monotone inside. A tick pulls the band forward and the position
continues within it, so drift is still corrected without a jump backwards. A genuine
discontinuity — seek, track change — is further away than the band is wide and resyncs exactly.
Replayed against the same session, the shipped algorithm produces **0 backward positions and 0
rewound series frames**.

One test had to change its mind: `tick_resyncs` asserted that a tick snaps back to the raw value,
which is exactly the rewind. It is now `tick_correctsWithoutRewinding`, with the reason recorded
in the test, plus a separate case for seeks.

**Filed, not fixed: BUG-108 — Skein's overlap flicker.** `Skein.metal` composites marks opaquely
on purpose (the §colour-mud audit rejected blending two stem colours), via
`if (cov > bestCover) { bestCover = cov; bestCol = col; }` at eight sites. That is a hard
per-fragment argmax with **no tie-break and no hysteresis**, whose decision boundary is the
equal-coverage contour between two marks. On that contour the winner flips on sub-pixel motion or
a sixth-decimal coverage difference, and the flip is a full colour swap. **Flicker at overlaps is
what the rule does by construction.** It predates LFSTEM.1 — nothing in the argmax has changed
since Skein certified — and became visible because on-time stem values move the audio-driven
radius terms more per frame than 2.5 s-late smoothed ones did. Fix options (lay-order tie-break,
narrow blend band, coverage quantisation) are a look decision for Matt, not an engineering one.

**Answered by the same session: BUG-110 is Skein's own.** The cost ramp reproduced with the clock
fixed — 38 ms at t=14 s rising to 127 ms at t=40 s and ~170–250 ms after — essentially identical
to the pre-fix session. The stem staircase was not inflating it, which is what the free A/B was
for.

---

### [dev-2026-08-27-134158] LFSTEM.1d — the stem series was being read on a 100 ms clock

**Matt, on the first Skein session with a pre-analysed series: *"Skein's performance is a little
twitchy at fullscreen."* Two separate findings came out of that session; this note is the one
that is understood and fixed.**

**The staircase.** `MIRPipeline.elapsedSeconds` — the playback clock every position-sampled
consumer reads — advances in **100 ms steps** on the local-file path. Measured on
`2026-08-27T13-24-37Z`: 1,714 steps of exactly 0.100 s, 1,345 of exactly 0.000, i.e. **39 % of
analysis frames do not advance it at all**, while totalling 197.4 s of clock over 197 s of
playback. Right on average, coarse instant to instant.

That was harmless until LFSTEM.1 gave it a fine-grained consumer. `instrumentFamilySeries` reads
it on a 1 s hop, where 100 ms is invisible. The stem series is on a **23 ms** grid, so it came out
as a staircase: stem values held for 2–6 analysis frames, then jumped four or more grid frames at
once onto whatever deviation spike was there — observed frame-to-frame jumps up to **6.0** on
`bassEnergyDev`, with a median frame-to-frame change of exactly **0.0**. The live path it replaced
computed features from a sliding audio window and was continuous by construction.

`PlaybackClockSmoother` dead-reckons by real elapsed time between ticks and resyncs on each one,
capped at 0.25 s so a paused or ended clock settles instead of running away, with `reset()` on
track change. Pure and clock-injected.

**The gate that was missing, and why.** `StemFeatureSeriesTests` proved a change at a known second
lands at that second — and it still does; the series was never misaligned. What no test covered
was the CLOCK the series is read against, so a correct map was read by an unsteady hand and
nothing went red. `PlaybackClockSmootherTests` closes that: its headline case reproduces the
measured 100 ms quantisation at the measured 18 Hz frame rate, and **fails without the smoother**
(16 of 35 frames do not advance), with a control asserting an already-continuous clock passes
through untouched.

**The second finding is filed, not fixed: BUG-110.** Skein measures **15.60 ms at 4K** in the
frame-budget harness and ramps to **~170 ms (≈6 fps)** over 50 s of live playback, then plateaus —
constant resolution, constant preset, GPU memory flat at 5.1 %, `ml_forced=0`, thermal nominal.
A cost that scales with canvas coverage fits the shape and is **not demonstrated**; the harness
renders 30 frames with no audio and can never see it. Whether LFSTEM.1's staircase was inflating
the flick rate and hence the ramp is a hypothesis with a mechanism and no measurement, which is
exactly the shape that cost BUG-100 four reproduction attempts. The A/B is free: the next Skein 4K
session on this build either still ramps or does not.
### [dev-2026-08-27-180955] BUG-102 resolved — both disputed references re-annotated, and they hid opposite truths

BeatBench's references for `money` and `bleed` both carried `status: metrical_review` — the
pipeline's own unresolved-disagreement flag — with both independent backends saying the taps were
an octave off, and Matt saying he would not trust his tapping on them. Everything scored against
those two tracks was uncitable, including the whole of suite 4.

Both have been re-tapped at the quarter note over 90 s spans, which is what every other track in
the set uses (87–99 s). **The two results point in opposite directions, which is the finding.**

- **bleed → `confirmed`.** 114.67 BPM, meter 4 at ratio 3.96, both backends AGREE (librosa 0.919,
  madmom 0.942), extended to the full track by madmom. Re-scored, the grid goes from
  F 0.61 / CMLt **0.03** / AMLt 0.84 to **F 0.99 / CMLt 1.00 / AMLt 1.00**. Phosphene was right all
  along; suite 4 was never a tracking problem. It also resolves a contradiction the repo had been
  carrying, where BUG-076's body called bleed's ~115 correct against three sources while the
  ground truth asserted 226.72.
- **money → `arbitrated_taps`.** 121.06 BPM, meter 7 at ratio 6.95, ratio ×1.01 against both
  backends — so the octave error is gone. What remained was a systematic −45 ms *phase* offset
  against both backends (which agree with each other to 2.4 ms). Not the rig: bleed was tapped in
  the same session on the same calibration at −13.6 / −0.4 ms. Matt's call is that the taps are
  the truth — a visualizer should fire where a listener feels the pulse, not where an onset
  detector does. Re-scored, money goes the OTHER way: AMLt **0.88 → 0.43**. The old half-rate
  reference made the grid's 116.19 look like a clean ×1.91 octave, which AMLt forgives by design;
  against the true 121.06 it is a plain 4 % tempo error. **Filed as BUG-110**, unfixed — the
  `dsp.beat` artifact obligations are deliberately not yet met.

**Tooling.** `reconcile.py` gained the arbitration path BUG-102's own fix note called for and the
repo lacked: decisions live in `Tests/Fixtures/beatbench/arbitrations.json` with their reasoning
and are stamped into the ground truth as `status: arbitrated_<decision>`. It never invents
timings — `decision: taps` keeps exactly what was tapped — so a disagreement no re-tap can settle
is recorded with provenance instead of hand-edited into the truth. Its `PHOSPHENE_GRID` context
dict was also a stale 2026-07-27 preview-clip snapshot listing bleed at 174.6 and money at 123.2
against live readings of 115.00 and 116.19 — a third apparent metrical level embedded in the very
artifacts under dispute; re-measured for the nine ground-truthed tracks.

**Suite 2's ratified baseline must now be quoted as AMLt 1.00 / 1.00 / 0.43 / 0.75 / 0.21.** New
baseline: `docs/diagnostics/BEATBENCH_BASELINE_2026-08-27.md`. Suite 1 holds at F 0.97.

**One thing the fixed references made visible: downbeats.** Only billie_jean has usable downbeat
F (0.90), against bleed 0.08, solsbury_hill 0.13, money 0.21, bohemian_rhapsody 0.25,
take_five 0.26. Consistent with FT.3's `BarLineEstimator` being built and not wired, and it
matters because D-205 makes meter/downbeat a hard gate — Nacre's and Glaze's downbeat pushes are
their connection layer.

### [dev-2026-08-26-225906] LFSTEM.1 — local-file stems arrive on time instead of 2.5 s late

**Code-complete; the Skein M7 is owed before this can be called done.**

Live stem separation is late by construction — a 2 s window plus inference — so every
stem-driven behaviour has been following the music by about a bar. For a local file that was
never necessary: the whole file is decoded during preparation, and the codebase already shipped
the pattern (`instrumentFamilySeries`, sampled by playback position, IFC.4 / D-177). Stems were
cached as a single snapshot of the track's first ten seconds where they could have been a series.

- **1a — the sweep.** `SessionPreparer.analyzeStemSeries` steps the separator across the whole
  file, keeping spans of 2 s and placing each at the END of its ~10 s window: deliberately the
  same relative position the live path reads from, so the series carries the character presets
  were tuned against without the lag. One analyzer instance sweeps in playback order so its AGC
  carries across spans, as it does across live separations. Placing a span flush with the window
  end dropped the frame starting on its last sample — 10 of 1292 over 30 s, invisible within any
  one span — which the drift gate caught on its first run.
- **1b — persistence, schema v10.** A raw `[StemFeatures]` dump in `stem_series.bin` (JSON for
  ~10,000 frames × 55 floats would dominate the entry), safe only because every stored property
  of `StemFeatures` is a `Float`, and guarded by a stored `stemSeriesFeatureStride`. Every read
  failure degrades to `.empty`: the series is an accelerator, and discarding a good cache entry
  over it would mean re-analysing a file that was already analysed.
- **1c — playback.** The local prep path builds the series; the analysis frame samples it at
  `mir.elapsedSeconds`; the live path stands down when one is installed, because both publishing
  every frame is a race, not a feature.

The alignment gate is the one that matters and it is asserted against a signal whose timing is
known by construction: silence then a tone at a known second, with energy required never to
appear EARLY (a start-placed window would surface it up to 8 s early) and only a little slack on
the late side for the analyzer's own EMA.

**Streaming is untouched and cannot have this** — a tap only ever carries audio that has already
played. `analyzePreview` stays free of the sweep for that reason, asserted by a wiring test.

⚠ **Owed before this is done:** the Skein M7. Around ten certified presets have stem routes tuned
against values that arrive 2.5 s late, and this makes them arrive on time — expected better, but
it is a real change in feel across the roster. **LFSTEM.2** (retiring live separation on the
local path, which takes a 142 ms MPSGraph job off the GPU every 2 s) runs after that M7.

### [dev-2026-08-26-224840] BUG-100 closed — the "sustained 4K degradation" was a preset switch inside the measurement window

**CLOSED, not fixed — there was nothing to fix.** BUG-100 held that sustained 4K rendering
degraded the whole app rather than the preset on screen: `frame_cpu` 17.6 → 44.9 ms and
`frame_gpu` 3.6 → 12.9 ms over 70 s, persisting into the next preset. Four 4K sessions have now
been measured with instruments in place, and both pieces of that evidence have an explanation
that needs no mechanism.

Matt ran the one reproduction never tried — **Stave for 101 s, then Witchlight, at 3840×2160**
(`2026-08-26T22-33-09Z`), the exact sequence the entry was filed from. With preset boundaries
taken from the data (a 101-frame rolling median of `frame_gpu_ms`) rather than log timestamps,
so no bucket straddles the switch:

- **Stave's `frame_gpu` p50 is 4.94 ms in every one of seven 15 s buckets across 101 s.** Flat to
  two decimals. Witchlight's is 11.44–11.48.
- `GPU_PRESSURE` holds `alloc_mb=489 used_pct=4.0 ml_forced=0` throughout; thermal `nominal`.

**The "persists into the next preset" evidence** was Witchlight's 24.4 ms compared against
*Stave's own* 17.4 ms — two presets with different costs, not one preset degrading. Measured
here in a session where nothing degraded: Witchlight 25.7 ms, Stave 16–20 ms.

**The ramp** matches a preset switch almost exactly: Stave→Witchlight moves `frame_gpu`
4.94 → 11.44 ms against the reported 3.6 → 12.9. A window spanning that switch produces the
reported shape by itself — the trap this program already documented when a 16.44 ms figure was
published off 89 frames spanning a transition.

⚠ **Residual, stated rather than papered over:** the original CPU endpoint (44.9 ms) exceeds
anything measured in any reproduction, and that session's artifacts have aged out of retention.
The GPU half is explained cleanly; the CPU half only partly. Reopen only on a new capture showing
`frame_gpu_ms` rising inside ONE preset at ONE resolution.

**One trend seen and correctly not filed as this defect:** inside Stave, `frame_cpu` p50 drifts
16.3 → 20.2 ms over 75 s with GPU flat. That is waiting, not working — `renderframe_cpu_ms` wraps
`renderFrame`, and the feedback path calls `view.currentDrawable` inside it, so the blocking
present wait is inside the timer (the same definition trap behind this entry's retracted
`encode_cpu_ms` finding). The values drift from just under the 16.7 ms vsync interval to just
over it.

What remains true and user-visible is that Stave and Witchlight are over budget at 4K — ~50 and
~39 fps. That is steady-state cost (BUG-098/099/101), not degradation. The instruments added
while chasing this (`GPU_PRESSURE`, `THERMAL_STATE`) stay.

---

### [dev-2026-08-26-215039] BUG-106 fixed — the ML dispatch gate now measures jank, not resolution

**Matt's call: (a) stems on time.** `MLDispatchScheduler` held the 142 ms MPSGraph stem
separation until every frame in a 20–30 frame window came in under `deviceTier == .tier1 ? 14.0
: 16.0` — a constant with no resolution term, compared against the *worst* frame of the window.
At 4K the median frame was 17.6 ms rising to 44.9 in BUG-100's session, so the window was never
clean: every dispatch deferred in 100 ms steps to the 1.5–2.0 s ceiling and force-fired anyway,
against a 2.0 s stem period. The gate prevented nothing and cost every stem update about a full
period.

`MLDispatchScheduler.budgetMs(floorMs:recentMedianFrameMs:)` now returns
`max(floorMs, median × 1.5)`, with the median taken over the same rolling window the max comes
from (`FrameBudgetManager.recentMedianFrameMs`). The question the gate asks changes from "is this
machine fast" to "is this frame worse than what this session normally delivers" — an absolute
threshold on a quantity whose scale varies with the input is the same mistake the audio side
corrected with deviation primitives (D-026 / FA #31).

- **1080p unchanged.** Median ≈ 8 ms → `8 × 1.5 = 12`, under both tier floors, so the floor
  decides exactly as before. An 18 ms frame there still defers.
- **4K opens.** A steady 25 ms session budgets 37.5 ms and dispatches; the same window against
  the old 16 ms constant still returns `.defer`, which is what proves the case bites.
- **Still a gate.** A 60 ms spike inside that same 4K session defers. Median rather than mean, so
  one 200 ms hitch does not raise the bar the next dispatch is judged against.

⚠ **One correction to the recommendation as written.** BUG-106 proposed deriving the budget from
the display's refresh interval. That would not have worked: at 60 Hz the interval is 16.7 ms, so
a 4K session at 17–45 ms never clears it and the gate stays shut. It has to follow what the
renderer actually delivers at this resolution.

Still owed: one fullscreen 4K session on this build — `ml_forced` should stay flat where it
previously climbed ~one per 2 s, and Matt's eye on whether stems now read with the music without
new stutter. That is the same session BUG-100 needs for `GPU_PRESSURE`.

---

### [dev-2026-08-26-212617] BUG-100 instrumented, and the ML dispatch gate turns out to be inoperative at 4K (BUG-106)

**Instrumentation, not a fix.** BUG-100 — sustained 4K rendering degrading the whole app rather
than the preset on screen — had one degrading session, two clean ones, thermal `nominal`
throughout, and its own artifacts have since aged out of retention. Two candidate mechanisms had
never been recorded at all, and both fit the reported signature (whole-app, survives a preset
switch, partially recovers after a lower-res interlude). Sessions now log one line per
`DRAWABLE_LIFECYCLE` heartbeat bucket:

```
GPU_PRESSURE alloc_mb=… budget_mb=… used_pct=… ml_forced=… ml_last=…
```

`alloc_mb`/`budget_mb` is this process's Metal allocation against
`recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` — at 4K every render target is 4× its 1080p size, and a working
set nearing the budget makes the driver evict, which is slow globally and recovers only when a
smaller target frees memory. `ml_forced` is `MLDispatchScheduler.forceDispatchCount`. What is
needed now is **one ~2-minute fullscreen 4K session** on a preset mix that has degraded before;
both mechanisms are then decided by three lines of log.

**BUG-106, found on the way and filed separately.** `MLDispatchScheduler` (D-059) is supposed to
hold the 142 ms MPSGraph stem separation until recent frames are inside budget. The budget it
compares against is `let budgetMs: Float = deviceTier == .tier1 ? 14.0 : 16.0` — **a constant
with no resolution term** — and the number it compares is the *worst* frame of a 20–30 frame
window. At 4K the median frame in BUG-100's own session was 17.6 ms rising to 44.9, so the window
is never clean: every dispatch defers in 100 ms steps to the 1.5–2.0 s ceiling and force-fires
regardless, against a **2.0 s** stem period. The gate never prevents anything at 4K and stems run
about a full period late there, compounding BUG-086.

⚠ **It is not offered as BUG-100's mechanism, and one recorded session refutes that reading:** the
PERF.15 Volumetric Lithograph run held flat across 172 s at 4K at p50 ≈ 31 ms — permanently over
the same budget, forced dispatch happening, nothing degraded. A mechanism that predicts the
direction of an effect is not an explanation of its magnitude (the BUG-090 shape). The fix is a
product decision — stems on time at 4K, or jank-free — and is Matt's call, written up on BUG-106.

### [dev-2026-08-26-204620] BUG-088 fixed — Aurora Veil's undeclared stem routes were dead computation, and a silence gate is not a driver

**RESOLVED.** BUG-088 was filed from a capture, which said Aurora Veil reads three primitives it
does not declare — `drumsEnergyDev`, `vocalsPitchHz`, `vocalsPitchConfidence` — and prescribed
adding them to the manifest so `RouteCoverageTests` could see them. Read against the source
instead, the premise inverts: **`AuroraVeil.metal` reads exactly the five fields its sidecar
declares** (`arousal`, `bar_phase`, `bass_att_rel`, `pulse_amp`, `valence`). The three
"undeclared reads" were consumed by `AuroraVeilState`, which computed a drum-kink charge and a
5-frame smoothed vocal pitch every frame and flushed them to `[[buffer(6)]]` — the buffer AV.7
stopped reading when it reauthored the preset as a nimitz *Auroras* port. Declaring those routes
would have gated values with no consumer.

**Deleted, not re-wired.** `AuroraVeilState.swift` (the class, its GPU struct, the slot-6 bind,
the per-frame tick closure), the `AuroraVeilStateGPU` struct + `[[buffer(6)]]` parameter in
`AuroraVeil.metal`, the app-side `auroraVeilState` property and `bindAuroraVeilRuntime`, and the
slot-6 binding in three test harnesses. Also `PresetSessionReplay/AuroraVeilRoutes.swift` — a
*second* manifest describing the same three deleted routes, which made `--preset aurora_veil`
report verdicts about a shader that no longer exists; `aurora_veil` no longer resolves there.
Aurora Veil's golden hashes are unchanged, because none of this reached a pixel.

**The recurrence fix: `AudioRoute.Kind.gate`.** The entry's second finding was that `pulseAmp01`
is declared `continuous` while the shader uses it as a silence gate — pinned at 1.000 through
music, p5–p95 range 0.000. That is correct gate behaviour, so the `continuous` floor
(non-constant + variance) is the wrong assertion; it passes today only because the fixtures open
in silence. A `gate` kind now carries its own floor — **peak ≥ 0.9 on every fixture**, i.e. the
only failure a gate has is never opening — and the three routes that were misdeclared are
reclassified: Aurora Veil `star_beat_twinkle`, Fractal Tree `silence_gate`, Ferrofluid Ocean
`spike_punch_gate`. **The arm was verified to bite**: floor temporarily raised to 1.5 → all three
routes red with peak 1.00; restored → 201 routes / 21 presets / 0 red.

### [dev-2026-08-26-141947] BUG-104 fixed — Rosette's curve had visible gaps from a nearest-point search locking onto the wrong branch

**RESOLVED.** Right after BUG-103's wing fix, Matt's next live look: *"Still too basic... Still
broken."* Asked what "broken" meant specifically: *"Lines do not connect. The motion is all
wrong."* Rendered diagnostic stills confirmed it directly — the tangle state (a=1.80) showed
real gaps cutting into the stroke; the cusped-star state (a=0.30) showed small disconnected dots
at the cusps.

Root cause: `rosetteDist`'s coarse-then-bisect nearest-point search tracked only the single
globally-closest raw coarse sample, then refined locally around it. Once the epicycle
self-intersects (which it does at higher `a`), several curve branches can pass near the same
query point — refining from one seed locks onto whichever branch owned the marginally-closest
sample and never checks a different, ultimately-closer branch. Wrong branch selected → distance
reported too large → pixels that should be stroke render as background. Quantified directly:
5.92% of the frame lit before the fix at the tangle state, 6.96% after (+17.5%).

Fixed by finding ALL local minima among the coarse samples (not just the global-best one, via a
small top-3 candidate list) and bisect-refining each branch separately. Verified the mechanism
by temporarily collapsing the fix back to 1 candidate — reproduced the exact pre-fix number
(0.0592) bit-for-bit — then restored it. New regression guard
`test_rosette_curveIsContinuousAtHighA`.

One thing this specifically was NOT: the small loops remaining at the cusped-star state's cusps
are real curve geometry (the second term's amplitude exceeds the threshold for an exact cusp
past a=0.25), not a rendering defect — checked the math before treating it as more bug to chase.

Filed and closed same-session as BUG-104 (`docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).

### [dev-2026-08-26-131626] BUG-103 fixed — Rosette's wing cartouche was rendering fully off-screen on real windows

**RESOLVED.** Matt's first live look at Rosette (`2026-08-26T12-58-21Z`, Cherub Rock) called it
"completely broken... no additional ornamentation" — a bare star with no frame. Root cause: the
mirrored wing arcs (D-217's "full cartouche") were placed at a hardcoded absolute x-coordinate
tuned only against 16:9-family renders (960×540 / 1920×1080). Matt's actual window rendered at
1080×1018 — aspect 1.061, nearly square — where the visible frame is narrower than the wings'
hardcoded position, so they fell **entirely outside the frame**. Every test and visual-dump this
program had run used a wide aspect; nobody had ever rendered Rosette at a square or narrow window.

`features.csv` for the same session ruled out a routing failure first: `tonal_consonance`,
`tonal_phase_fifths`, `harmonic_flux`, and `bassDev` all varied actively and in-range — the
"broken" read was the missing cartouche exposing a real, validated (if low-consonance,
self-intersecting) generator state with nothing signaling it was intentional.

**Fixed** by scaling the wings' x-placement proportionally to the frame's actual visible
half-width, referenced against the 16:9 aspect they were originally tuned at — reproduces the
approved D-217 look exactly there, stays on-screen at any other aspect. New regression guard
(`test_rosette_wingsVisibleAtNearSquareAspect`) renders at Matt's exact reported window size and
checks luma in the independently-derived expected wing column bands; confirmed to fail without
the fix (max luma 12/255) and pass with it.

Filed and closed same-session as BUG-103 (`docs/QUALITY/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).

### [dev-2026-08-13-163115] BUG-087 partially fixed — and the remedy was wrong about what limits the rate

Local-file analysis goes **10.0 → 16.4 Hz**. BUG-087's ≥ 40 Hz target is **not met**, and the
measurement says why: slicing was the wrong lever.

`BUG087.2` moves the analysis time base off wall-clock onto the audio each callback carried —
behaviour-neutral, zero existing expectations moved, and a prerequisite for producing several
analysis frames per callback. `BUG087.3` slices each delivered buffer into 1024-frame pieces.

**Why it falls short.** Slicing raised *computation* to ~47 Hz but not what a preset sees. All
five slices complete within microseconds — they process already-buffered audio — so the render
loop samples ~1.6 of them and supersedes the rest. The gap distribution is bimodal: 39 % of
changes 1 render frame apart, 55 % five to six frames apart. A burst against a 100 ms arrival
period. **The ceiling is how often audio arrives, not how finely it is cut.**

Kept anyway: +64 % effective rate, and fresher values since the last slice reflects the newest
1024 samples rather than a position inside a 4410-frame buffer.

**The lesson this repo keeps re-learning:** a regression test here asserted `hz >= 40` from
slice count and **passed**, while the live capture measured 16.4 Hz. It was measuring the
computation rate and calling it the delivered rate. Renamed and re-scoped. Getting smaller
buffers out of AVAudioEngine is filed as its own increment.

---

### [dev-2026-08-12-200701] BUG-086 closed — stem latency 5.4 s → 3.0 s, and two lessons about aiming a review

**RESOLVED.** Per-stem features reached presets ≈5.4 s behind the audio; they now reach it at
3.0 s streaming and 2.9/3.0 s local file, with Matt's `dsp.stem` gate passed on Skein + Glaze.

**The fix was three interlocking constants, not a bug.** Separation ran every 5 s on a fixed
10 s chunk with the read window starting 5 s in — so `latency ≥ separationPeriod`, and the 5 s
head start was runway rather than slack. Period → 2 s with the read offset **derived** from it.

**Two things measurement corrected afterwards, both mine.** The "2.5 s nominal" was wrong:
`latestSeparationTimestamp` is stamped *after* `separate()` returns, so
`latency = nominal + inference`, and at 531 ms measured inference that predicts 3.03 s against
3.0 s observed. ≈3.0 s is therefore the architectural floor at a 2 s period, not a tuning
target. And the 142 ms inference figure the duty estimate rested on lived only in a code
comment — real is 335 → 478 → 531 ms across three captures, duty ≈30 %, one 7105 ms outlier.

**The review-aiming lesson is the transferable part.** The `dsp.stem` gate was first aimed at
Aurora Veil on a stale note calling `other_energy_dev` its "song-defining anchor." Git says it
was dropped at AV.2.h and AV.7/D-185 reauthored the preset onto mood envelopes; **Aurora Veil
declares no stem route at all.** Matt spent a review on a preset that could not answer the
question, and reported exactly that — *"the veil is just aurora-ing."*
`Scripts/check_route_liveness.py` now answers "can this route be seen at all?" from a CSV
before anyone is asked to look. Re-aimed at Skein — 22 of 28 routes ALIVE, zero DEAD, all
eight stem-deviation routes live — the gate passed first time. The Aurora Veil manifest
mismatch it exposed is **BUG-088**.

**Also fixed en route:** a `track='([^']*)'` regex that dropped `Stayin' Alive` from an
index-aligned label list and shifted 13 of 15 published track labels, taking with it a
"finding" that jazz was the hardest register. It is among the easiest; dense compressed
productions are hardest. Numbers were always per-segment; only attribution moved.

### [dev-2026-08-11-164751] BUG-086 — every stem-driven preset was running 5.4 s behind the music

Found while measuring driver viability for a plotting preset (CHR.1), where a
multi-second lag is disqualifying rather than cosmetic. It turned out not to be a
preset problem: **per-stem features reached presets ≈5.4 s late while the beat grid
beside them was time-aligned to ≈0.3 s** — on the local-file path, in steady state,
deep inside tracks. Every stem-driven preset was affected, Aurora Veil's
`other_energy_dev` anchor included.

**Nothing was miscoded.** Three independent literals across two files described one
relationship that no line named: separation every 5 s, on a 10 s chunk, with the
per-frame read window starting 5 s into that chunk. The chunk's newest sample is
"now", so reading 5 s in reads 5-s-old audio; the window then advances in real time
and can only do so for `chunkLength − startOffset` before clamping at the chunk's
end — and that span has to cover one separation period. So **latency ≥ period**,
and the 5 s head start was runway, not slack.

Chunk length is not a lever: `StemSeparator.modelFrameCount = 431` is fixed by the
exported Open-Unmix model. The period is the only one, at one full inference each.
Now 2 s with the read start **derived** from it (`10 − 2 − 0.5` margin), giving
**2.5 s nominal latency** for ≈7 % inference duty, up from ≈2.8 %.

**Two things worth keeping.** First, the comment that made this invisible was not
wrong, it was a non-sequitur: *"Features carry ~5-10s of latency … acceptable
because musical sections persist longer than that."* True premise, and it holds for
section-scale coupling — but any preset pairing stems against the time-aligned beat
grid gets two clocks disagreeing by the full lag, and nobody had checked. Second,
the 142 ms inference figure that the duty estimate rested on lived **only in a code
comment**; no session artifact carried it, so the estimate could not be checked
against reality. `STEM_SEPARATION:` now logs measured inference, duty and nominal
latency to `session.log`, which makes the cadence decision falsifiable from any
capture.

The measurement that found it is `docs/diagnostics/CHR1_STEM_DECORRELATION_2026-08-11.md`
§7b–§8 — three independent methods agreeing, with the FFT bands as the alignment
control at 0.2–0.4 s and a CSV-internal measurement (no WAV at all) putting the lag
at 5.4 s on 39 of 40 stem × track pairs.

**Status: automated verification complete, manual gate outstanding.** Engine
1809/1810 (sole failure the pre-existing DOC.6 rotation gate), app target
**411/411** — 404 before, plus the 7 new tests, no existing test moved — lint clean.
Running the app target needed a live `PhospheneApp` quit first (BUG-072).

The new suite was also checked against the defect rather than only for greenness:
restoring the 5 s period fails it with `stemNominalLatencySeconds → 5.5 < 3.0`. A
gate that passes against the bug it names is worth nothing, so it was run that way
before being trusted.

Still owed: the `dsp.stem` manual gate. Stem timing is felt on every stem-driven
preset, so Aurora Veil needs M7-class observation before BUG-086 goes to Resolved —
the tests prove the arithmetic, not that the coupling feels right. And the duty
cycle has not been measured in a real session yet, which is what the new
`STEM_SEPARATION` line is for.

### [dev-2026-08-10-164918] BUG-078 closed for the second time — the reschedule race, caught with a stack

`AVAudioPlayerNode` teardown was still trapping the engine test process on trees that
contained the BUG078.1 fix. **Measured 10 crashes in 14 runs of
`swift test --filter concurrentDoubleStart`; 0 in 30 after this change.**

**Two routes to one trap.** BUG078.1 (2026-08-07) closed the *overwrite* route — a running
instance orphaned when two `start()` calls raced. This is a second, independent route:
`scheduleFileLoop` checked `playerNode === player` under the lock, **released it**, and only
then called `player.scheduleFile`. A `stop()` landing in that window armed a command on a
node the provider had already released; AVFAudio's own `AVAEBlock` retains the node inside
that queued command, so it became the last strong reference, and its destruction on the
node's own `CommandQueue` ran `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` there — whose `Stop()` `dispatch_sync`s
into the queue it is already on. libdispatch traps.

**The lesson worth keeping.** BUG078.1's gate — adopted instances == torn-down instances —
stayed **green** through every one of these crashes, because the instance really was being
torn down. **A green invariant gate is evidence about the invariant it states and nothing
else.** The green gate is what made "resolved" look safe for three days.

**Method note.** macOS wrote no `.ips` for any occurrence, so the stack came from
`lldb -k "thread backtrace all"` after replicating SwiftPM's launch environment
(`DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which SIP strips from the shell). A temporary
probe then quantified the window: **every run recording a stale re-arm crashed (8/8); no
clean run recorded one (0/4).**

**What was not achieved, and is not claimed:** a fast deterministic gate that goes red on
the surviving race. The new `rescheduleRacingTeardown_…` test does **not** reproduce the trap
(0 in 6 against the faithful pre-fix ordering); it asserts only that the guard fires, proving
the window is entered. The crash needs full-suite load — the same wall BUG078.1 hit. The
before/after measurement is the load-bearing evidence, and the entry says so.

### [dev-2026-08-07-203000] BUG051.1 closed on Matt's live m3u run — and the build-identity check that nearly didn't happen

Session `2026-08-07T20-20-07Z`: `normal.m3u` (one `.m4a`, one `.mp3`, one `.flac`, absolute paths with spaces, brackets and an apostrophe) queued and played all three. `prepareLocalFiles DONE cached=3 failed=0 total=3`, both advances `ok=true`, `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=clean`, tap healthy at −2.03 dBFS. BUG-051's manual criterion is met and the entry is closed.

**The part worth keeping.** The first run of that same playlist (`2026-08-07T20-12-09Z`) looked equally clean and proved nothing about the fix: the app it launched was built at 15:08:13 from a *parallel* worktree whose `M3UParser.swift` contains zero occurrences of `allowedAudioExtensions`. Every log line an observer would check — the dispatch, the three-file queue, the clean verdict — read identically in both runs, because the fix is invisible at the UI by construction (both app entry points already filtered by extension; what changed is that the guarantee moved to the parser). A no-op and a pass are indistinguishable in the log.

So for this class of change — one deliberately designed to alter nothing the user sees — the log is not the evidence. **Which binary ran is the evidence.** The closing run was confirmed by matching the app's access time (15:20:21) to the session start (20:20:07Z) and the `M3UParser.o` compile time (14:48:41) to the source edit, before reading a single line of `session.log`. The generalisation of the existing worktree-reaches-the-build rule: verifying the build is not a precaution for risky changes, it is the *only* signal when the change is meant to be invisible.

Housekeeping: `Scripts/rotate_docs.sh` filed the closed BUG-051 straight from §Resolved (recent) to `KNOWN_ISSUES_HISTORY.md` in the same pass, because rotation keys on the `(2026-06-15)` **filing** date in the header, not the resolution date. Anything filed more than 14 days ago skips §Resolved (recent) entirely the moment it closes. Content is preserved and the doc gates are green; noted because the section's name now overstates what it holds.

### [dev-2026-08-07-195110] BUG051.1 — the m3u allow-list moved down to the trust boundary

BUG-051 was filed by CLEAN.2.4's threat model in June and has sat as the one unblocked, bounded defect on the board since. It is fixed: `M3UParser` now canonicalizes every resolved entry and filters it against `allowedAudioExtensions` (`m4a`/`mp3`/`flac`) before the entry is stat'd or handed onward. A hostile playlist naming `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `../../etc/passwd` resolves to zero entries and throws `noEntriesResolved`.

Canonicalization was the quieter half. `resolveURL` ran `standardizedFileURL` on the relative branch only; the `file://` and absolute branches returned whatever the line said. All three branches now standardize, so `..` segments collapse *before* the extension check reads `pathExtension`, and a `file://` string that isn't a file URL is rejected outright.

**What was deliberately not built.** The filing suggested rejecting entries that don't resolve "under an expected root". Containment would break normal use — exported playlists from iTunes and foobar2000 routinely address a library above the playlist's own directory with absolute or `../` paths — and it closes nothing the extension check doesn't already close, since both attack examples in the filing are extensionless. `parse_allowsTraversalToRealAudioOutsidePlaylistDir` pins that traversal to real audio still resolves, so a future session doesn't add the guard back by reflex.

**A correction to the original filing, since it changes how the residual should be read.** It claimed the resolved path was "handed to AVFoundation" with "no allow-list short-circuits it first". Both app entry points — `openLocalM3U` and the drop handler — already filtered the parser's output by `allowedExtensions`, so the decoder never saw a non-audio path. The real residual was narrower: an `isReadableFile` stat of an attacker-named path, and that path landing in `skippedLines`/logs. What the fix buys is that the guarantee no longer depends on every caller remembering to filter. The two caller filters stay as belt-and-braces, and `LocalFileMenuCommands.allowedExtensions` now aliases the engine constant so the two lists can't drift apart.

Gates: engine 1800 green, app 407 green, SwiftLint strict 0 violations, app build clean. The manual criterion (open a normal `.m3u` and confirm nothing changed) is Matt's; the parse layer is covered by the suite.

### [dev-2026-08-07-193500] BUG078.1 manual close — 19 starts, 18 teardowns, strict alternation

Matt ran the local-file path end-to-end on session `2026-08-07T19-10-25Z` (5 files): start, pause/resume, natural track end, single Next, two rapid-Next bursts, quit. Clean — `CHAIN_HEALTH: verdict=clean`, drawable lifecycle 4815/4815, no hang, no crash.

The useful part is that the run left an artifact rather than an impression. The provider breadcrumbs read **19 `provider.start INSTANCE` / 18 `provider.teardown ENTER`** in the exact sequence `I(EXI)*` — every adopted instance torn down before the next was adopted. The unpaired 19th is the one still playing at log end; `deinit` tears down with `diagnostic: nil` and emits nothing. **Zero orphans in production, through bursts of 3 and 5 starts inside a single second.**

**What it does not prove, stated so nobody reads more into it later.** Every teardown is ordered `ENTER → EXIT → INSTANCE` — the pre-lock `stop()` path. The BUG078.1 stale-teardown path prints `INSTANCE → ENTER` and never fired, because the app drives `start()` from the MainActor and serialises it. The live session establishes no-regression plus the orphan invariant on the shipped path; the concurrent-start race stays covered by the deterministic gate. That the app cannot easily reach the race is also why the trap has only ever been seen in the test process.

BUG-078 is closed.

Unrelated observation from the same log, filed nowhere because it is already covered: the five tracks installed grids with `meter=` 1, 2, 3 and 4 across them — the `beatsPerBar` instability BUG-076 describes, visible on ordinary local files.

### [dev-2026-08-07-180458] BUG078.1 — the AVAudioPlayerNode trap was a concurrent-start overwrite, and the evidence was already on disk

Twenty-five `.ips` reports for this trap were sitting in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`, nineteen of them naming `concurrentDoubleStart_serializesWithoutDeadlock` on a live thread. The entry said nobody had captured the trap; nobody had *read* it. The two racing threads are right there in the report — `_startLocked()` on one, `stop()` on the other — and they name the mechanism.

**`start()` tears down before taking the lock** (BUG-021, so AVFoundation teardown never runs under the `NSLock`). Two racing starts interleave as: B's `stop()` snapshots nothing → A's `_startLocked()` adopts and plays instance #1 → B's `_startLocked()` overwrites the fields with #2. Instance #1 is orphaned **while running**. Its last strong reference is the one AVFAudio holds inside the pending `scheduleFile` completion block, so the node is finally released on its own `CommandQueue` — and `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]` → `Stop()` → `dispatch_sync` re-enters the queue it is already running on. `_startLocked`'s comment claiming "the fields below are guaranteed nil" was the false premise, now corrected in place.

**The leading hypothesis was wrong and is worth recording as such.** The strong `self` from `guard let self` in `scheduleFileLoop` is not involved: there are **no Swift frames** between `_Block_release` and `-[AVAudioNode dealloc]`, so the object released there is the node, retained by AVFAudio's own wrapper block. Every capture in our completion block is `weak`.

**Fix.** `start()` snapshots the existing refs under the lock — a pointer copy, no AVFoundation calls, so BUG-021's constraint holds — and tears them down after unlocking, holding a strong reference across `player.stop()` so the command queue drains before the final release. This also closes the orphaned-engine leak.

**Gate.** `LocalFilePlaybackStartRaceTests` counts adopted instances against teardowns over 24 racing double-starts, which turns a 1-in-3 full-suite lottery into a 3-second deterministic check: **48 adopted / 25 torn down (23 orphans) before the fix, equal after**. It asserts the orphaning rather than the trap, because the trap needs full-suite timing and a gate that only fires under load is not a gate.

**Full-suite ×5 clean** (1794 tests / 270 suites per run, no new `.ips`). That streak alone is weak evidence — at the observed ~1-in-3 trip rate it would happen by chance ~13 % of the time — so the deterministic 23 → 0 orphan count is what carries the fix.

Still open on the manual criterion: local-file playback end-to-end (start, seek, track-change, quit-while-playing) is Matt's call on the shipped path.

### [dev-2026-08-07-171113] BUG079.1 — the release test build works, and the DBN.2 budget is met (17.9 ms vs 50 ms)

`swift test -c release` could not build the engine test target: `ArachneState.forceActivateForTest(at:)` sat inside `#if DEBUG` while its three test-target call sites did not. Dropped the gate rather than guarding the call sites — the smaller fix would have quietly removed the Arachne spider render coverage from every release run, and losing coverage to fix a build is a bad trade.

**The point of fixing it was the number.** BEAT_SYNC_PROGRAM_PLAN §DBN.2 budgets < 50 ms for a 30 s activation window; DBN.2 could only measure debug and had to assert a regression ceiling with the real budget marked UNVERIFIED. Measured now: **17.9 ms in release** against **1403 ms in debug**. A 78× config gap — the debug figure never carried information about the budget, and the spec's warning against scaling it was right.

`DSPPerformanceTests` now asserts 50 ms under release and keeps the 4000 ms debug regression ceiling, so the plan gate is enforceable instead of documented.

One correction to the filing: `swift test -c release` on its own still fails, and that is not a defect — `@testable import` needs testability, which release does not enable. The working invocation is `swift test -c release -Xswiftc -enable-testing --package-path PhospheneEngine`.

### [dev-2026-08-05-214036] DYN.1d — the usability gate rejected exactly the tracks that needed the fix

Matt on Cherub Rock: *"the tree grows a bit too much BEFORE the distorted guitar comes in and then does not jump up again when the distorted guitar enters."* Both halves are one threshold.

DYN.1c's `isUsable` required 4 dB of inner range before a measured loudness profile would replace the fixed band. **A brickwalled master has a narrow range — which is precisely when a fixed absolute band is most wrong.** Cherub Rock measures **1.46 dB**, was refused, and the surge pinned **93.6 %** of the session. Saturated by 30 s, there was no headroom left for the guitar entry to step into, which is exactly what Matt saw.

Ranked instead: **0.6 % pinned**, stepping **0.237 → 0.887** across the entry. Verified with the real analyzer over his own capture.

**Narrowness was never the hazard.** At 1.46 dB the ranked surge sits in the same regime as the Hummer capture Matt approved as reading musical — 2.87 turns/s vs 2.41, and *less* pinning (0.5 % vs 1.4 %). The floor is now 0.5 dB, which still catches the real degenerate case: a distribution with no shape at all.

**It failed silently, which is the part worth fixing structurally.** `measure()` returned nil, the entry persisted at v7 with the field absent, and every later play was a cache HIT that logged nothing — the install line's missing `loudness=` suffix looked identical to a line predating the field. Schema is now **v8** (a v7 entry holding a nil profile would keep it behind a cache hit forever), and the breadcrumb prints `loudness=none (fixed band)` out loud. A silent fall back to the defect you are fixing is the worst failure shape available.

Regression gate added: a 1.5 dB synthetic master must produce a usable, ranking profile, and it asserts the fixture sits under the OLD 4 dB gate so it cannot rot into a tautology.

---

### [dev-2026-08-05-140643] DYN.1c — the loudness band is per-track now, and the first design was wrong

`spectral_surge` used one absolute band (−24…−15 dB) for every song. Measured on Matt's Hummer capture (`2026-08-04T20-23-15Z`) that band saturates at 31 s and stays pinned for **63.3 %** of the track, reading **1.000 at both** the arrival and a section 4 dB louder half a minute later. Two identical numbers for two visibly different moments is the whole of *"the tree had grown to full size before the full band kicked in later in the song."*

For a local file the whole thing is decoded during preparation, so the track's loudness distribution is measurable before a note plays. `LoudnessProfile.measure` runs it through the shared `FFTMagnitudeKernel` at the live hop, `MIRPipeline.setLoudnessProfile` installs it per track alongside the cached `BeatGrid`, and the surge becomes "how loud is this moment **for this track**". Same capture: **0.9 % pinned**, arrival 0.613, the louder late section 0.945, climbing 0.07 → 0.32 → 0.61 → 0.95 across the track with the guitar entry still landing as a step.

**The plan specified p10→p95 and that does not work — 63.3 % → 46 %.** The surge follower rides peaks, so any two-edge band topped by a percentile re-saturates the moment a transient in the last couple of seconds crosses it. A sweep did find a pair that works (p30→p99, 13.5 % pinned), and shipping it would have been the real mistake: **p30 is a constant fitted to one track's intro length — the fixed band's error one level up.** What ships maps the level through the track's own CDF (33 quantiles, `rank(ofLevelDB:)`): no fitted constant, and only the top few per cent of a track can pin by construction. The mapping table is in `DYN1_CALIBRATION.md` for whoever is tempted by two edges again.

Streaming is unchanged by construction — the profile is produced only where the whole file is decoded, and `analyzePreview` (shared with streaming) deliberately does not make one. `isUsable` gates on the p12.5→p87.5 **inner** span rather than min→max, because the minimum quantile is routinely −200 dB: the silent frame before the first note would otherwise make a constant-level source look dynamic. Cache schema **v7** — v6 entries re-analyse rather than replay profile-less, since a silent fall-back to the fixed band is exactly the defect.

**Also found, deliberately not fixed: the live analysis rate is ~47 Hz, not the ~10 Hz every DYN comment assumes** (mean `deltaTime` 0.021 s = 1024 samples at 48 kHz — it is just the tap buffer). Every quoted τ in `SpectralAnalyzer` and the calibration doc is ~4.7× too long. The shipped alphas are unaffected because they were swept for measured response, not derived from a target τ, so this is a comment-accuracy defect whose correction touches every DYN constant's stated rationale — recorded in `DYN1_CALIBRATION.md` §Analysis rate and raised rather than folded in silently.

Still owed: the live M7. Green gates on a recorded capture are not a visual sign-off.

### [dev-2026-08-04-185133] RECON.13 — BUG-080's last follow-up, and a correction to the audit that filed it

`Scripts/fixtures.manifest` is now the single source of truth for which gitignored files a default `swift test` needs. Three consumers read it — `link_fixtures.sh --verify`, `bootstrap_fixtures.sh`'s no-op guard, and the Swift gate (renamed `FixtureManifestPresenceGate`) — where previously the shell side and the Swift side each kept their own idea of the required set, synced by hand.

**The duplication was hiding a granularity mismatch, which is the more interesting half.** The shell asked *"is the directory non-empty"*; Swift asked *"does this specific file exist."* So a tempo tree holding **1 of 3** clips satisfied both shell checks and still failed the tests they exist to protect — the restore scripts would cheerfully report success on a tree that could not pass. Verified by removing one clip: `--verify` and `bootstrap_fixtures.sh` both previously exited 0, and now both fail naming the exact missing path. Confirmed the gate is not vacuous by adding a bogus manifest entry and watching it go red, then reverting.

**The correction matters more than the fix.** The 2026-08-03 audit reported that `fetch_tempo_fixtures.sh` covered "3 of at least 8" required fixtures, naming `pyramid_song`, `yyz`, `clair_de_lune`, `money` and `if_i_were_with_her_now` as missing — and that claim was written into RUNBOOK §Worktree setup at RECON.4, where people follow it. **It was wrong.** The default-required set *is* those three clips and the fetch script retrieves all of them. The claim had conflated three separate fixture systems:

| System | Where | Gated by | Default-on |
|---|---|---|---|
| tempo clips | `Tests/Fixtures/tempo/`, gitignored | `FixtureManifestPresenceGate` | **yes** |
| BeatBench (17 tracks) | *outside the repo*, `BEATBENCH_FIXTURES_DIR` | own sha256 gate | no |
| harness audio (`pyramid_song`) | `Tests/Fixtures/tempo/` | none | no — env-gated suite |

`BeatGridResolverTests` — cited in the original claim as calling `pyramid_song` "the load-bearing gate" — never references it; its only consumer is `RicercarFluidVideoHarness`, which carries "env-gated" in its own suite name.

Root cause of the bad claim: a name-frequency grep across the test tree, with hits attributed to the wrong system and never opened. **That is the same failure shape as RECON.1's fixture deletion earlier in the same audit** — a count treated as evidence. Two instances in two days from one habit, so the lesson is now in `AUDIT_KEEPLIST` and in this note rather than only in a memory: a grep tells you a string appears, never what depends on it. Open the consumer.

The RUNBOOK now carries the three-system table in place of the wrong ceiling.

### [dev-2026-08-03-233415] RECON.1–.4 — the production audit, and the drift it found

A full audit of the production environment (defects, plan state, pipeline health, dead code, repo hygiene), then the cleanup it justified. Read-only inventory first; no changes until Matt picked from the findings.

**The headline is not a code defect.** The codebase is in good shape — zero P0/P1 defects, retired presets cleanly removed, CI green and branch-protected. What had rotted is the **record**: `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` carried 22 stale or missing entries and `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` 12 contradictions. Both are load-bearing — the plan is authoritative for intent, the tracker for open defects — so a session planning from them was planning against a world that no longer existed. Concretely: §Immediate Next Increments still presented the 2026-05-06 QR→DSP→V→MD→SB ordering; Phase ASH's header said "planned" 240 lines above its own M7 sign-off; and the open-defect index listed two bugs that were already stamped resolved *in the same table row*.

**The two entries that moved in opposite directions are the ones worth remembering.**

*BUG-041 closed.* Matt's call, on a PUB.3 flag that had been waiting since 2026-07-11 for a one-line confirm. Recorded explicitly as a **close-on-absence, not a close-on-proof** — the gates have been green since June and the flash hasn't recurred across many sessions, but no dedicated M7 was run against a worst-case hard-onset track start. The reopen path is left intact and the fixtures retained. Its inline `dev = 35` aside was promoted to **BUG-084** first, so closing the parent couldn't quietly bury a real finding: a StemAnalyzer deviation reaching 35 where the primitive's measured ceiling is ~3.4, suspected divide-by-near-zero against a not-yet-converged per-track EMA. No product impact today only because the FBS.S3.2 soft knee caps it — the input is wrong, the output is defended.

*BUG-060 reopened.* Asked whether the force-quit hang had recurred since mid-July, Matt said it had. That **falsifies "likely resolved by NACRE.2b"**, which was one clean session from closing. The value is that it narrows rather than widens: BUG-061's preset-apply race is fixed on its own evidence, so whatever hangs the render loop is *not* that race. The "confirm by non-recurrence" plan is retired — it has now returned a negative — and replaced with a capture step that works **outside Xcode** (`sample PhospheneApp 10 -file …`), since a hang leaves no crash log and the recurrence wasn't hit under the debugger. This is the same instrument that diagnosed the BUG-059 deadlock class.

**Hygiene.** 47 GB of stale Xcode DerivedData pruned (52 GB → 4.9 GB; 58 → 6 `PhospheneApp-*` dirs), **explicitly preserving the canonical primary-project build** so the Screen-Recording grant doesn't churn — the hash was re-derived from `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` rather than trusted from memory, and confirmed unchanged. LaunchServices reseeded per the known prune+reseed remedy. Deleted three unreferenced `fbs/` CSVs and `tools/data/corpus_manifest.csv` (verified byte-identical to the `.csv.gz` every consumer actually reads).

**What the audit got wrong, and how.** The dead-asset sweep initially flagged `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/_pg_spares` as orphaned on a zero-code-references signal. It is not — three curated reference READMEs cite it as Matt's alternate set. Reference images inherently have no code consumer, so the metric was simply wrong for that class of file, and the same reasoning spared `tunes_club.csv` (a script opens it by relative path). This is exactly the failure `AUDIT_KEEPLIST.md` exists to prevent — and that register turned out to be missing 3 of its own 14 executable targets, now added.

**Operational fixes.** Four stale facts in docs people follow to do work: the RUNBOOK's CI line said `macos-14` when CI runs `macos-26` (a live trap — macos-14's SDK red-builds 18 Metal-Sendable errors, so "restoring" it from the doc breaks the gate); §Worktree setup documented only the older, narrower `bootstrap_fixtures.sh`, now leading with `link_fixtures.sh` and documenting both ceilings that made BUG-080 a misdiagnosis (the 3-of-8 fetch limit, and bootstrap's "directory non-empty" guard that exits 0 on a partial tree). The Physarum agent-network capability was merged into the renderer registry from a root-level staging file — overdue since Filigree certified on 2026-06-28.

**D-213** records Matt's call to delete the zero-consumer **RMENV.2/.3** (gallery environment) and **MFX.1** (temporal upscaler) capabilities. The audit measured their consumer count as zero *and structurally so*: no preset sets `"environment"`, and KSRB.2 — the production wiring that would let one opt in — was never built. Applies the D-203 precedent (the light rig was decommissioned the day its consumer stopped). RMENV.1 multi-light is explicitly retained; it has three live consumers. **Decided, not executed** — it touches the four-way `SceneUniforms` mirror and needs its own increment.

**Deliberately left for Matt:** the 5 superseded + 3 stranded unmerged remote branches, and the BUG-080 "third instance" decision. **Queued follow-ups:** fixture-restore consolidation behind one shared manifest, CI Option B (the hand-maintained ~130-test allow-list currently leaves new suites invisible to CI), wiring `check_drums_beat_intensity.sh` into CI, and BUG-079 (release-config test build, which blocks every release-only perf budget).

**A process note, since this is the second time.** The D-161 ratchet says a rule violated twice gets mechanized. Plan-vs-tree drift has now well exceeded that. The cheap mechanization is one more `DocIntegrityTests` invariant: every increment ID appearing in `git log` since the last rotation must appear in `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`. That single check would have caught 8 of the 22 drift items automatically, including all five phases that shipped without a row.

### [dev-2026-08-03-212502] BUG-082 / BUG-083 — test runs were deleting real session captures

Started as "six of seven sessions today recorded zero rows — that looks like the silent-tap class." It was not. The empty folders were **empty by construction**, four of the six were **my own test runs**, and chasing them turned up two defects that together were quietly destroying diagnostic captures.

**BUG-083 — a session folder was written on every `VisualizerEngine` construction.** `SessionRecorder()` is built unconditionally, and its `init` created the directory, both CSV headers and the startup banner *before any session existed*. So every app-target test run and every app launch closed without recording left a folder in the user's `~/Documents/`. Proven by experiment rather than inference: count folders, run `xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test`, count again — a header-only session appeared and an older one was evicted.

`init` now computes paths only; directory creation, headers, banner and the disk pre-flight moved to `materializeIfNeeded()`, called from the first actual write. Every disk-touching path is guarded — frame rows, logging, the raw-tap WAV, the stem dump, the video writer — and `finish()` early-outs when nothing was written, so it cannot conjure the very folder the fix prevents.

**BUG-082 — retention kept 6, not 10.** `sessionFolders` enumerated *every* directory under `uzume_sessions/` and sorted by name descending on the stated assumption that they are all ISO timestamps. In ASCII letters outrank digits, so the four permanent fixture folders (`fixturegen-*`, `beat-match-test-session`) held slots 1–4 of "newest first" **forever** — consuming retention *and* immune to pruning, because they were always inside the kept prefix. The fix filters to names that parse as a session timestamp, so a non-session directory is neither counted nor deleted.

**Why they mattered together.** Test runs manufactured folders that consumed a window already shortened to six, so a handful of runs was enough to evict everything real. This is not hypothetical — it destroyed `2026-08-03T15-05-43Z` *while it was the input* for Witchlight motion-sequence renders, and I initially misread its disappearance as Matt having cleaned up.

**Two things worth carrying forward.** The BUG-082 regression test was confirmed **red before the fix** (6 surviving sessions against the expected 10) — a retention test that passes pre-fix would have been worthless. And making `dateFromFolderName` load-bearing exposed a latent trap in it: an unconditional `index(startIndex, offsetBy: 10)` that crashes on any shorter name, harmless while only the age-based arms called it and a launch crash the moment every directory is parsed. Rewritten as a strict format match.

### [dev-2026-08-03-200455] BUG-080 — the propagation chain had no source of truth, and nothing checked

`Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` copies gitignored-but-needed files from the primary checkout into each new worktree. Two independent breaks meant a correctly-prepared worktree — and `main` itself — failed the engine suite. Diagnosed, widened P3 → P2, fixed and validated in one increment (Matt approved the collapse in chat).

**Gap A: a stale allowlist.** PUB.2 moved the 479 ML weight files out of git; `linked_rel` was never updated, and the trailing `grep -E` filter admitted only `Tests/Fixtures/` paths or image extensions, so a `.bin` would have been rejected even if the directory had been added. Weights held 4/1/1 entries in a fresh worktree against the primary's 176/162/147.

**Gap B is the one worth remembering: the primary checkout was never verified to be a complete source, and it wasn't.** Three licensed `.m4a` tempo clips existed only inside an unrelated worktree — so no worktree could ever obtain them, and the primary failed the same gate. A script that links *from* the primary cannot supply what the primary lacks. It reported `linked N fixture(s)` while propagating a hole. `BeatThisFixturePresenceGate` (QR.3) is the only reason this surfaced instead of silently disabling the BeatThis regression surface — that gate paid for itself.

**The fix** replaces the allowlist with a `<path>|<required>|<regex>` manifest and adds the missing invariant: `required=yes` plus an empty source tree is a hard error with a path-and-instructions message, not a silent skip; per-path match regexes let `.bin` through where it structurally could not before; missing-on-disk files warn and set a non-zero exit instead of continuing in silence; and a new `--verify` mode checks source completeness without linking anything, runnable from the primary as a standalone CI-ready gate.

**A third instance surfaced from `--verify` on its first run.** `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES` and `docs/diagnostics` report **0 gitignored files in the primary**. The reference images D-211 extended this script to propagate are gone everywhere — so the "silently degrades preset work rather than failing" outcome D-211 warned about has been the standing condition, not a worktree-only risk, and `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` holds READMEs describing images nobody can see. Left `required=no` (promoting it would fail every run today) but it now warns on every invocation. **Needs a decision, and blocks FTR.2's reference curation.**

**Validation:** full engine suite green in the FTR.1 worktree — XCTest `225 tests, 7 skipped, 0 failures (0 unexpected)`, swift-testing `1732 tests in 246 suites passed`. The `LocalFilePlaybackProvider` concurrency failures were cascade and clear once the fixtures exist. Honest caveat recorded in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: that worktree ran the *pre-fix* script against a hand-repaired environment, so criterion 1 is met in substance but not literally — the patched script's own first fresh preparation is still owed.

**The generalisable lesson:** a propagation mechanism with no manifest, no provenance and no completeness check is not a mechanism, it is a coincidence that happened to hold. The primary was authoritative only because it was the clone that happened to receive the files.

### [dev-2026-08-02-164808] LFS.3 — reclaim runbook, written from an incident rather than from theory

`Scripts/reclaim-lfs-visual-refs.sh --execute` was run on 2026-07-31 with branch protection active. It **half-applied**: `main` and all 27 `refs/pull/*` were rejected by GitHub, while 18 branches and 3 tags were force-updated to a disjoint rewrite. Branches read 1,945-2,099 commits "ahead" of `main` and could not merge. Fully recovered — 21 refs restored, 21/21 verified, ancestry back to 2-14 ahead — but only because the pre-rewrite commits happened to still be in a local object store. **No ref capture had been taken beforehand.** That was luck.

[`docs/RUNBOOK_LFS_RECLAIM.md`](RUNBOOK_LFS_RECLAIM.md) is the procedure so the next attempt does not rely on luck. What it makes unmissable:

- **Rewriting history does not reduce the bill.** GitHub does not GC unreferenced LFS objects; a Support request does. Do the rewrite and stop, and you have paid the whole cost for none of the benefit.
- **The half-apply is the DEFAULT outcome** with branch protection on, not an edge case — and the half-applied state is strictly worse than either end state (bill unchanged AND branches broken). If you cannot finish, do not start.
- **Capture every ref SHA before pushing.** That file is the undo, and building the restore refspec from it is a one-liner.
- **Decide scope once.** The 479 weight objects are not in the current regex and are likely the larger share of the bill; batching them in is the difference between one disruption and two.
- **Verify coherence, not just SHAs.** Matching SHAs can still leave a broken graph — the real check is that branches share ancestry with `main` again.
- The dry run reporting "94% smaller, verified clean" is **not** a green light. It says the rewrite is correct; it says nothing about whether the push will apply.

Cross-referenced from `RUNBOOK.md` and `PUBLISHING.md` §1, which now also records that the weights cutover and image untracking are both DONE and are "stop the bleeding" changes only.

### [dev-2026-07-31-214500] WL.2 — Witchlight: authored, gated, and one mechanism-level finding for Matt

`Witchlight` exists as a production preset — `.metal` × 2 + sidecar + `WitchlightStroke`/`WitchlightPath`, registered at every point in `NEW_PRESET_CHECKLIST.md`, all gates green, `certified: false` awaiting Matt's live M7.

**The headline is a finding, not a feature.** The design's own §6 flagged two level-3 grounding ratings and scheduled a motion gate to answer one question before any shading work: *does the figure read as a drawing?* Answer, measured on all three fixtures: **the stroke reads as a stroke, but not as a figure.** It is a smooth beaded luminous trail with monotonic falloff, visible hue banding, bar-marker beads and a clear head — the `01`/`02` register. What it does not do is form a multi-lobe legible gesture; it draws one long gentle arc.

The cause is mechanism-level, and it was isolated rather than guessed. Under §3.1(b)'s kinematics the heading is (up to the clamp) just the smoothed harmonic phase: `θ̇ = k·φ̄̇` integrates to `θ ≈ k·φ̄`. The measured phase reverses at high frequency around a concentrated mean (heading monotonicity **0.01–0.12** on all three fixtures — i.e. the pen turns left and right in near-equal amounts), so the *net* direction barely moves and the pen travels nearly straight. `k` is the design's only shape lever, and **raising it 1.1 → 2.6 → 5.0 changes the figure not at all** — past k ≈ 1 the clamp saturates and the heading becomes a slew-rate-limited version of a zero-mean dither, which makes it *more* straight, not less. §6's prescribed response to this gate failing is to re-scope, explicitly not to spend M7 rounds tuning `ω_max`. **This is Matt's call and the closeout carries the options.**

**What the measurement did prove.** Phase travel reproduces the design's §2.3 table almost exactly — **2.09 / 1.80 / 15.10 circles per 30 s** against the doc's 2.1 / 1.7 / 15.4 — so the pen is demonstrably being steered by the same smoothed quantity the design was written against. That check earned its keep: it caught a stray second EMA on the phase *rate* that was cancelling the reversals and cutting travel to 0.85 / 1.09 / 3.95.

**Three defects the harness caught that eyes would not have.** A per-frame `relaxLambda` of 0.30 — ~100 Laplacian passes across the mutable window — collapsed a 2-circle heading sweep into a visually straight stroke (Laplacian shrinkage; now a per-second rate, which also removed an fps dependence). Beads sized in world units went **sub-pixel exactly as the auto-fit framed the growing trail** — the buffer accumulating while the screen footprint shrank, which is precisely the split a CPU-only assertion cannot see. And a unit error in the star falloff (multiplying a cell-space distance by the cell count) rendered the star field completely empty at every density.

**Flash safety, measured against every §5 ceiling:** 0.00 flashes/s; peak full-frame mean luminance **0.0237** (ceiling 0.35); max Δ/frame **0.0009** (ceiling 0.06 — Mitosis 0.0116, Cytokinesis 0.0263); flare extent **0.006 %** of frame at ≥50 % peak (cap 3 %) and **0.126 %** at ≥10 % peak (cap 12 %); 30 flares in 30 s under a 4.5 Hz asking train, the 900 ms refractory holding at its ≈1.1/s ceiling. The static-render guard fired twice and was fixed at the harness, never weakened: the shared worst-case train leaves the whole TONAL block at zero, so Witchlight's hero driver was dead in it.

**All eight declared routes carry per-route firing evidence** from the three real fixtures. `trail_contraction` (`sectionIndex`) greens on `there_there` only — exactly the at-risk status the design declared, on the ≥1-fixture structural floor, floor untouched.

**Two divergences from the design doc**, both surfaced rather than silently reconciled: the star suppression and head flare are drawn in the particles pass instead of `witchlight_sky_fragment` (§7.1's placement would have needed a shared-render-path change WL.2's constraints rule out — same visual, no GPU-contract change), and Witchlight joins `StatefulRuntimeRegistry` with no slot-6 buffer purely to get `StructuralPrediction` into a `ParticleGeometry`.

**Also found, not actioned:** `Spectral Cartograph`'s committed golden is 2 bits from a fresh measurement. Verified pre-existing by re-measuring with Witchlight fully removed from the tree; inside the ≤8-bit tolerance, not regenerated.

### [dev-2026-07-31-214125] LFS.2 / PUB.2 — the LFS-billing fix, split in two because half of it was backwards

Matt was being billed for GitHub LFS storage. A branch existed to fix it (`claude/lfs-charges-gitignore-ecd130`) and bundled two changes; **one was sound and one did the opposite of what it intended.** Split, landed the good half, redid the other.

**Operator note, learned the hard way when this branch merged it:** pulling the cutover **deletes your local weight files** — they were tracked, the merge removes them, and 479 `.bin` files vanish from disk. Every ML test then fails with `graphBuildFailed`. The fix is one command, and it is the whole point of the design: **`Scripts/fetch_weights.sh`** re-downloads and verifies all 482 files. The same happens to reference images, except nothing fails — they just quietly aren't there (which is why `link_fixtures.sh` now symlinks them).

**Sound and landed as-is — the weights cutover (PUB.2).** The ~167 MB of ML weights now ship as the `ml-weights-v1` GitHub Release asset, fetched and verified by `Scripts/fetch_weights.sh`. CI swaps `git lfs pull` for the fetch script and re-keys its cache on `SHA256SUMS`; `Scripts/check_lfs_smudged.sh` is removed because it guarded a smudge that can no longer happen and would have passed vacuously. Precondition verified before landing, since getting it wrong breaks every clone: the release exists (2026-07-22) and the fetch script is idempotent.

**Backwards, and redone — the image half (D-211).** It added `.gitignore` rules for `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES` + `docs/diagnostics` images and dropped their LFS filter, but **never ran `git rm --cached`**. `.gitignore` does not affect already-tracked paths, so the files stayed tracked and — with the filter gone — became full blobs:

| | Image bytes in the git object database |
|---|---|
| `main` (LFS pointers) | 25.7 KB |
| that branch (real blobs) | **100.6 MB** |

Zero files left the index. Merging it would have written ~100 MB permanently into history while leaving the LFS objects, and the bill, exactly where they were. The redone version untracks all 203 images for real.

**The lesson generalises:** for a "stop tracking this" change the load-bearing step is `git rm --cached` — the `.gitignore` edit only governs what happens *next*. Verify by counting what actually left the index, not by reading the ignore file.

**Stated plainly: this stops new LFS objects, it does not reclaim the old ones.** GitHub does not GC unreferenced LFS objects, so storage keeps billing until the history is rewritten *and* a Support request purges the orphans. `Scripts/reclaim-lfs-visual-refs.sh` does the rewrite (dry-run by default) and documents the Support step. **Neither is run** — that is its own decision with its own blast radius.

**Worktree consequence handled up front rather than discovered later.** Gitignored files do not reach new worktrees or fresh clones, and preset work is *read the README and look at the images* — so a worktree without them degrades silently instead of failing, which is worse. `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` now symlinks the images alongside the test fixtures it already handled. Same trap the gitignored tempo fixtures already sprang; same fix.

Also noted: the superseded branch carries a **D-195 that collides with main's D-195** (motion review gate). It is not merged and should not be.

### [dev-2026-07-31-161121] WL.1 — Witchlight: reference set, measured drivers, and a design that is gated on them

Docs-only increment opening an MD.6 Milkdrop-inspired uplift. Inspiration source `martin - witchcraft reloaded`; the source file is not committed (D-116 bullet 4). Decision: **D-209**.

**The concept.** Same visual register as the source — a beaded luminous ribbon hanging in deep space, sparse parallax stars, a soft violet bloom, a bright point at the head — with the one thing the source lacks: the stroke means something. The pen tip turns with the track's harmony, so the figure is a drawing of the last thirty seconds of the song, and each bead's hue records where the harmony was when it was laid down. That is the D-121 divergence axis (dominant motion model, consequentially palette character), Matt's call 2026-07-31, and it is trivially demonstrable side by side: the source's figure is the same species of scribble on any track and a *different* scribble on a repeat play; Witchlight's is the reverse.

**The increment's most reusable output is the measurement, not the design.** Task 3 was a hard stop — establish from real captures what each candidate driver actually does, and if the harmonic drivers were not alive, re-scope rather than design against a dead signal. Four captures: the three committed route-coverage fixtures plus an 88-minute live streaming session (318 383 frames). `tonal_phase_fifths` measured alive on all four, so the documented palette-and-sky fallback was not triggered. Three findings outlive Witchlight:

- **`pulse_amp01` is a silence gate, not a driver — and it is working correctly.** It sits at 1.000 on 98.7 % of the 318 383 live frames, which is exactly what the capability registry says it should do (0 before the first note, 0 across sustained silence). No defect; the correction is that an always-on gate has no dynamic range, so citing it as a *driver* cites a constant. `pulse_phase01` is the steady-pulse driver and measures a full 0–1 sawtooth.
- **`harmonic_flux`, `tonal_tension` and `section_index` are alive live but near-flat on 2 of 3 offline fixtures** (`harmonic_flux`: p50 0.058 live, 0.2 % nonzero on `love_rehab`). The QG.1.1 offline/live gap, surfacing on a new family of primitives. Design consequence: Witchlight cannot use a flux primitive as a chord-change detector. Whether the gap is a fixture-generation artifact or a real capability gap is **open**.
- **`spectral_centroid` reads 0.04–0.21 on real music** — third sighting after BUG-027 and CR.1.1 / D-197.

**And one that shaped the design.** The smoothed harmonic phase's angular rate varies **~10× across tracks** (0.91 vs 11.4 rad/s p95 at τ = 1.5 s). Handed to a pen tip unchanged, the identical code draws the hero reference (a legible written figure) on one track and the anti-reference (an unreadable tangle) on the next — the same sparkler, the only difference being how fast the hand moved. The answer is a **bounded-curvature advance**: fixed governed speed, clamped turn rate, minimum turning radius ≥ 8 % of frame height. The harmony controls curvature only, and curvature cannot exceed the legibility bound. A mechanism, not a tuning constant.

**Flash budget designed up front**, against an anti-reference taken from the source itself: its head flare saturates most of the frame to white on mid-band hits and re-fires on every one. Witchlight targets **0.00 flashes/s by construction** — max Δluma/frame ≤ 0.06 sits below the 0.10 WCAG swing threshold, so no transition qualifies as a flash at all — plus a ≥ 900 ms hard refractory, a ≤ 3 % / ≤ 12 % spatial extent cap, and a ≥ 60 ms / ≥ 200 ms envelope.

**Two level-3 grounding ratings are open and Matt has them:** no empirical grounding for driving a light-painting stroke's *geometry* from harmonic state, and none for the *combination* of that path with age-weighted relaxation and a beaded 30-second trail — structurally the Aurora Veil failure shape. The mitigation is scheduled rather than hoped: WL.2's **first** deliverable is a motion-gated look-spike answering "does the figure read as a drawing?" before any shading work. Fractal Fly-By burned 14 rounds not doing that.

**Also landed:** `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/witchlight/` — 13 images across long-exposure light painting, calligraphic brushwork, deep-sky astrophotography and plasma-arc photography, eleven license-verified from Commons, with an 8-item mandatory-traits checklist and a 6-item anti-reference list. Zero `CheckVisualReferences` warnings.

**Environment finding, not a defect:** the branch point looked red — 41 engine tests failing on ML weight loading — because this worktree's Git-LFS objects had never been materialized (`.bin` files were 129-byte pointers). `git lfs checkout` plus `Scripts/link_fixtures.sh` restored 1711/1711 green. Same class as the known worktree-fixture gap, one layer deeper; worth folding into `link_fixtures.sh`.

### [dev-2026-07-31-143943] D-208 — D-E resolved: final0 not adopted; beat-sync's evidence levers are exhausted

Matt, 2026-07-31: "don't adopt final0." small0 remains the shipped grid model. Resolves D-E against the MDL.1 data — no meter improvement (2/6 both), a 4 % and inconsistent move in the degeneracy metric, a regression on `bleed`, at ~10× the weights and ~1.3× inference.

**The program-level consequence is bigger than the checkpoint choice.** Three increments have now established the same finding by independent routes: **TRK.2** falsified onsets as a source of beat evidence (only ~15–25 % of onsets from *any* band or stem land within ±50 ms of a beat, D-206); **DBN.2** removed the observation-model bias and found odd meters still won by hairline margins, with a confidence signal that cannot separate right from wrong; **MDL.1** scaled the model 10× and got no cleaner downbeat stream. **The downbeat evidence is thin, and it is not thin because of how we read it.**

So categories 2 and 4 need a **changed premise**, not another pass at these levers — and **DBN.3 should not open as specified**, because A/B-ing the decoder against the incumbent would measure its known-wrong odd meters and non-separating margin rather than the decoder itself. Unexplored candidates: a different model family, a different training target, or sourcing bar position from something other than a downbeat activation stream. Phases GT / FT / RLG / CNF are unaffected — FT in particular still lands category-3 wins for local files independently of this.

Code retention stated explicitly per D-097 rather than assumed: `BeatThisModel.Variant`, the external `weightsDirectory` seam and `Final0ABTests` are kept as the reproduction of a committed measurement (~40 lines, env-gated, verified behaviour-preserving for small0), **with a named deletion trigger** — retire them if MDL is retired or if they are still consumer-less at the next pruning pass.

### [dev-2026-07-31-134559] MDL.1 — final0 A/B: no gain, and the evidence ceiling is not capacity

**Recommendation: DO NOT ADOPT.** D-E is Matt's call; the data is committed at `docs/diagnostics/MDL1_FINAL0_AB_2026-07-31.md`.

Ran because DBN.2 ended with a specific finding — with an unbiased decoder the remaining gap is **evidence quality, not model bias** — and `final0` is the only lever in the program that changes the evidence rather than how it is read. Everything needed was already on the machine: the checkpoint from DSP.2 (81 MB, no download) and a converter that already accepted `--variant final0`.

The architecture delta is exactly one hyperparameter (`transformer_dim` 128 → 512, driving embed dim, head count and FFN width; `n_layers` / `stem_dim` / `spect_dim` identical), so it ships as `BeatThisModel.Variant` rather than a second model, with an external `weightsDirectory` seam — **81 MB does not enter the bundle before D-E decides**. Run through the real MPSGraph path, not the PyTorch reference, because D-E asks about prep latency and only the shipping path can measure it.

**Result: meter correct 2/6 for both variants** (final0 gains bohemian_rhapsody, loses bleed — a trade). Mean downbeat:beat ratio 0.494 → 0.475, a 4 % move that is not even consistent (money 0.90 → 0.59 improves; solsbury_hill 0.69 → 0.87 and take_five 0.41 → 0.58 get worse), at ~10× the weights and ~1.3× steady-state inference. **`bleed` — the suite-4 case the plan expected final0 to fix — regresses**, its BPM doubling 115.00 → 259.43 and its meter going 4 ✓ → 2 ✗.

**Corollary that matters more than the decision: the evidence ceiling DBN.2 hit is not a capacity problem.** Scaling the same model family does not produce a cleaner downbeat stream, so categories 2 and 4 need a changed premise rather than a bigger checkpoint. Caveat recorded rather than buried: there is no final0 layer-match fixture, so that port is unverified — build one before adopting against this recommendation. The variant refactor itself is proven behaviour-preserving for small0 (all 26 `BeatThis*` tests pass, including the layer-match suite that caught four bugs at DSP.2 S8).

### [dev-2026-07-30-230451] DBN.2 — decoder built and unit-tested; odd meters still collapse to 4

`BeatActivationDecoder` implements the DBN.1 spec: bar-pointer state space (Krebs et al. ISMIR 2015 Eq. 1–8, CC BY 4.0), tempo transitions restricted to beat positions (Eq. 9–10), observation model (Böck et al. ISMIR 2014 Eq. 3) extended to Beat This!'s two streams. Clean-room from the papers, no madmom code (D-077). Offline-path only; **not wired into `BeatGridResolver`** — that is DBN.3. 14-case unit suite green.

**D-207 ships rather than defers.** The result is "a meter **or** no confident bar": `beatsPerBar` is `Optional`, declining withholds downbeats but keeps beats, and the meter-margin is the gate.

**Two tunables moved off their spec defaults, both from measurement, not taste.** `downbeatWeight` 1.0 → **5.0**: at the spec's initial 1.0 the decoder picks the *wrong* meter on the degenerate-downbeat fixture — Böck Eq. 3's beat/non-beat terms swamp the downbeat evidence and the margin is 0.0012, i.e. the meters are indistinguishable. `meterMarginThreshold` 0 → **0.10**, set from the margin distribution across all 9 ground-truthed tracks as D-207 requires — **but the correct and wrong distributions overlap** (correct min 0.1439, wrong max 0.2677), so the margin is necessary-but-not-sufficient and 0.10 is a tradeoff, not a decision boundary.

**Performance:** 17,067 → **1,350 ms** for a 30 s window (debug) via precomputed observation classes, per-frame terms computed once rather than per state-frame, a flattened transition table and unsafe buffers in the forward recursion. The plan's **50 ms is a release figure and stays UNVERIFIED** — `swift test -c release` does not build in this package (BUG-079, filed) — so the gate asserts a regression ceiling and documents that, rather than dividing the debug number by an invented constant.

**⚠️ The honest real-audio result, ahead of DBN.3's gate: the decoder collapses every odd meter to 4.** On the 6 truth-bearing tracks it is correct on 3 (billie_jean, bohemian_rhapsody, bleed — all 4/4) against the incumbent's 2, but money (7), solsbury_hill (7) and take_five (5) all decode as 4. The improvement over baseline comes mostly from *declining*: confidently-wrong falls from 7 tracks to 2. **The category-2 case the phase exists for is not solved**, and DBN.3 should not be treated as a formality.

### [dev-2026-07-30-220117] DBN.1 — bar-pointer decoder spec, premise tested not assumed

Phase DBN opens. `docs/design/DBN_DECODER_SPEC.md` specifies a bar-pointer decoder over Beat This! activations — state space (Krebs et al. 2015 Eq. 1–8, CC BY 4.0), transition model (Eq. 9–10), observation model (Böck et al. 2014 Eq. 3), output contract, DBN.2 verification plan — with every constant cited to an equation or marked a Phosphene tunable with default, range and rationale. **No decoder code written**; DBN.1 is spec-only by design (the D-077 countermeasure).

**The premise needed testing, because Beat This! is titled "accurate beat tracking *without* DBN postprocessing".** Its authors A/B'd a DBN on the same model we ship: beat F1 **89.1 → 88.1**, downbeat F1 **78.3 → 77.4** — the DBN made F1 *worse*. It helped only continuity (CMLt downbeat 67.3 → 73.3), by "correcting some of the (wrongly) non-periodic outputs". That single benefit is exactly our failure mode, so the premise survives on narrower grounds than the plan assumed — and DBN.3 now has to gate on **no regression** to the clean 4/4 tracks where their A/B says a DBN costs F1.

**Task 7 measured where the signal dies and killed two hypotheses.** The resolver *does* diverge from the reference (Beat This! moves all downbeats to the closest beat; we discard beyond 40 ms — filed as BUG-077) but **100 % of candidates survive the gate**, so it explains nothing. And the failing tracks have too *many* downbeats, not too few: the model emits a confident downbeat on **69–90 % of beats** on money and solsbury_hill, vs 24 % on the working billie_jean. The downbeat stream is near-degenerate on odd meters, and peak-picking cannot choose which subset is the bar line because that is a global periodicity question. Instrument: `DownbeatStreamDiagnosticTests` (env-gated).

**Design consequence, grounded in our own baseline rather than the paper:** decode each meter hypothesis separately over a *narrow* tempo band centred on the existing trimmed-mean-IOI estimate, because tempo is not the broken axis (grid BPM already tracks truth wherever beats work). Per-meter state space drops from 6,703 states / 28.2 M Viterbi ops to **1,351 / 2.8 M**, making the < 50 ms budget reachable; the naive joint state space over 7 meters is ~77 k states and ~231 MB of backpointers. Two DECISION-NEEDED items for Matt: guess-vs-decline when the bar is unclear, and whether {6,9,12} join the meter set.

### [dev-2026-07-30-164919] D-206 — phase TRK parked, DBN is the next beat-sync lever

Matt's call on the TRK.2 finding: "park the tracker, go DBN next session." Two levers — controller topology (TRK.1) and evidence source (TRK.2) — have now been measured against the same frozen single-BPM grid and neither closes BUG-065, and the TRK.2 measurement shows why further tracker work is dead-end: only ~15–25 % of detected onsets, from **any** band or stem, land within ±50 ms of a beat, so a tracker fed an onset flag cannot be tuned into tightness whatever its controller. BUG-065 stays **open and bounded**; `PHOSPHENE_BEAT_PLL` stays default-off; TRK.3 has no content. The plan's category-4 leverage entry "TRK.2" is withdrawn — category 4 now rests on DBN + MDL. Next beat-sync session opens phase DBN (bar-pointer-model decoding over Beat This! activations). **Do not reopen TRK without a changed premise about the *grid*, not the tracker.** D-206.

### [dev-2026-07-30-163241] TRK.2 — drums-stem onset evidence measured and falsified (BUG-065)

**No runtime behaviour changed.** TRK.2 proposed feeding `LiveBeatDriftTracker` drums-stem onsets instead of sub-bass, on the theory that the drums stem "carries the actual pulse" where sub-bass flux saturates. The session prompt made that conditional on measuring it first; the measurement says no, so tasks 2–5 were not started. Built `DrumsOnsetEvidenceTests` (env-gated `PHOSPHENE_TRK2_EVIDENCE=1`, asserts nothing, prints a table): runs the production `BeatDetector` on the full mix and a second detector instance (D-075) on the production `StemSeparator`'s drums stem, all six bands, matched to the same grid with `GridOnsetCalibrator`'s ±200 ms window and bias-corrected. Offline separation validated against the live path's own dumps (RMS-envelope r = 0.82 at the correct lag). Result, share of onsets within ±50 ms of a grid beat (drums-stem sub_bass vs full-mix sub_bass): love_rehab **16.9 % vs 42.2 %**, Hummer session `2026-07-30T15-39-21Z` **11.0 % vs 14.4 %**, `bleed.wav` **22.4 % vs 22.3 %**, billie_jean **25.5 % vs 24.5 %** — worse on two, a wash on two, *including Bleed*, the category-4 track the whole argument rested on. Best drums band anywhere +2.5 pp, inside noise. **Durable finding worth more than the increment:** across every capture, band and stem only ~15–25 % of detected onsets land within ±50 ms of a beat — FA #68 generalises from sub-bass to the entire spectral-onset family, so any tracker whose evidence is an onset flag inherits a ~75–85 % off-beat rate regardless of controller topology. **Second, independent blocker:** `runPerFrameStemAnalysis` deliberately carries 5–10 s of latency with a ~5 s sawtooth re-anchor, so drums onsets cannot be timestamped by the tracker without a distinct design. BUG-065 stays open; the next lever is the DBN decoder, not the tracker — Matt's call. Evidence: `docs/diagnostics/TRK2_DRUMS_STEM_EVIDENCE_2026-07-30.md`.

### [dev-2026-07-26-202738] VL.CERT — Volumetric Lithograph CERTIFIED

Matt's M7 on session 2026-07-26T20-06-59Z (chain clean): "Session looks good. Proceed with certification if all checks out." All gates measured green: (1) RouteCoverage — 6 declared routes (bass->dolly speed, per-stem energies->palette hue, downbeat->fold ratchet) all fire on the canonical fixtures, 0 red; the identity coupling (fold rotation SPEED + terrain morph, both off accumulatedAudioTime) is the animation time base and reads constant offline, documented as the QG.1.1 boundary not declared (FD/VL precedent). (2) Rubric — certified declares a non-empty manifest; the uncertified-gate passes (VL correctly certified). (3) Flash — added VL to the multi-pass flash harness (ray_march, no follower); MEASURED 0.00 flashes/s, 0 transitions, luma 0.18–0.24 under the worst-case beat train, because VL-PSY.5 moved the downbeat onto geometry (rotation) not luminance. certified:false->true, rubric_profile:full, added to FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets. HONEST CAVEAT surfaced to Matt: the automated rubric PROXY scores VL 3/15 — not a hard gate (the proxy is known-unreliable; many certified presets score low and are certified via M7), and VL's coupling lives in accumulatedAudioTime + fold rotation where the proxy can't see it; cert rests on Matt's M7 + route coverage + flash, not the proxy. VL is the catalog's first certified terrain-flight / kaleidoscope preset.

### [dev-2026-07-26-200106] VL-PSY.6 — Volumetric Lithograph: per-cell variety kills the spatial repetition

Matt's Spotify-length M7 (session 2026-07-25T18-53-36Z): "aligns with the music pretty well… good variation of the terrain… though it is on the repetitive side." The terrain-over-time variety he liked was working; the residual repetition was SPATIAL — pModMirror2 maps every 20-unit cell to an identical fundamental domain, so each cell rendered the same mandala (~one cell-crossing every 5s at the flight speed). Fix: the mirror cell INDEX now seeds a per-cell offset on the noise's third axis, so each cell samples a different SLICE of the 3D field — successive mandalas differ in relief and (via a small per-cell hue drift) colour, while the offset is constant within a cell so the 6-fold x/z symmetry is untouched. It's the temporal slice-drift trick that already gave terrain-over-time variety, applied across space. Warp strength 4→5.5 into the perf headroom for extra cell distinctness. Matt confirmed the before/after ("right side looks much less repetitive"). Verified on the real session: motion gate 0 spikes/0 frozen, symmetry intact (clean 6-pointed stars still form), perf 10.8 ms p95. Goldens regenerated.

### [dev-2026-07-24-224144] VL-PSY.5 — Volumetric Lithograph: ratchet the rotation, kill the second beat layer (BUG-075)

Matt M7 (session 2026-07-24T22-22-10Z, Hummer): "The motion is WEIRD… dialing on a rotary telephone, combined with pulsing on the beat." Both diagnosed from the session features.csv. (1) The VL-PSY.3 downbeat twist was a transient envelope that rose then fell to zero, so the fold angle advanced then sprang back — reconstructed angular velocity −8.5→+22.5 rad/s, 2.7% of frames spinning backward. (2) The v9 drum-hit peak-lift (terrain height + palette flare + ridge strobe) was still live, a second beat layer at a different rate — the FA #67 fight. Fix: the downbeat is now a monotonic eased ratchet (advance one notch per bar and hold, off the cached grid; not amp-gated, so a quiet bar can't collapse it backward), and the drum-hit peak-lift is retired so the beat drives exactly one thing. The accumulatedAudioTime terrain morph Matt liked is untouched. Verified on the real session via SessionReplayHarness: 0% backward, motion gate 0 spikes / 0 frozen. Goldens byte-identical — the synthetic fixtures set no beat position, so only real-session replay gates this class (why VL-PSY.2/.3 slipped). Perf 10.7 ms, unchanged. Residual: a one-time ~24 rad/s snap at BeatGrid install, logged not fixed. SEPARATE + UNRESOLVED: the app crashed ~3.7 min into playback (hard fault, not a slowdown — fps held 59.9 to the last frame); no crash report reachable, needs Matt's .ips.
### [dev-2026-07-24-221819] VL-PSY.4 — Camera dolly speed moves to the preset sidecar (BUG-074 follow-up)

Closes the replay-harness camera-parity gap VL-PSY.3 filed. Per-preset forward dolly speed lived in app code (`VisualizerEngine+Presets.applyPreset`, a `switch desc.name`), which the engine-side `SessionReplayHarness` can't import — so it replayed every dollying preset with a static camera (silently wrong for Volumetric Lithograph, whose identity is the flight). New sidecar field `scene_dolly_speed` on `PresetDescriptor` (default 0 = camera-static); `VolumetricLithograph.json` sets 5.0. `applyPreset` and `SessionReplayHarness` now both seed `cameraDollySpeed` from the descriptor — one source of truth; the app-side switch and VL-PSY.3's `REPLAY_DOLLY` env stopgap are both deleted (the stopgap arrived when main merged into this branch and was removed here). Byte-identical live behaviour (VL already dollied at 5.0) and goldens (the dolly integrator is 0 on frame 1; goldens never call `applyAudioModulation`). Confirmed: VL replays with its forward flight, no env var (session `2026-07-24T22-01-51Z`, 60 frames — terrain flows toward the camera).

### [dev-2026-07-24-214802] VL-PSY.3 — Volumetric Lithograph motion rewrite: rotate the tube (BUG-074)

Matt's M7 on the VL-PSY.2 build: "the music response is TERRIBLE, creating a convulsing mess… I REALLY dislike the motion." Root cause was a category error, not a tuning miss: VL-PSY.1/.2 drove the kaleidoscope's *symmetry order* from audio — the vocal swell moved it 3→9 and every downbeat snapped it (2.67×/s at 171 BPM). Order is integer-valued (non-integer orders leave the last wedge unclosed) and remaps every point in the world, so the geometry convulsed and swept through malformed folds between frames. Compounded by two audio-hierarchy faults: the downbeat fired per-beat not per-bar (the D-154 Ferrofluid lesson, whose envelope VL-PSY.1 copied while dropping the lesson), and the continuous driver `mid_att_rel` measured 0.009 on real music while the dev fixture drove it 0→1 — so the beat became the only motion.

Fix: a real kaleidoscope is a *fixed* tube of mirrors you rotate. Symmetry order is now FIXED at 6; ported hg_sdf `pR` and rotate the domain before the polar fold. Rotation is an isometry — no Lipschitz cost, no seam, every intermediate a valid kaleidoscope, so it's smooth by construction. The angle accumulates `VL_ROT_BASE·time + VL_ROT_SWELL·accumulatedAudioTime + VL_ROT_KICK·downbeatTwist`: energy sets rotation SPEED off an already-integrated signal (a noisy swell can't make a jittery angle), the idle term keeps it turning at silence (which also fixes the VL.1 frozen-at-silence finding), and the twist is gated to beat 0 of the bar.

Verified on Matt's REAL session via `SessionReplayHarness` (FLY.6 — the harness built for exactly this "offline looks nicer than live" class, which VL-PSY.1/.2 should have used): motion gate 0 spikes / 0 frozen / max 1.32× median, vs a signal that swung six orders with 4.8-order single-frame jumps. Rotation speed picked by Matt from a 3-speed real-audio GIF comparison (0.55 rad/s).

Fidelity ("visual quality is lower" — a real regression from the BUG-073 perf fix): warp restored 2→3 octaves; full restore measured 13.5 ms over the 12 ms gate, so partial at 11.4 ms p95. Stated as partial, not claimed as whole. Sidecar cost updated to measured values (18/24). Follow-up filed: `SessionReplayHarness` renders dollying presets with a static camera because `cameraDollySpeed` lives in the app target it can't import — worked around with a `REPLAY_DOLLY` override, real fix is moving dolly speed into the sidecar.
### [dev-2026-07-24-164940] TESTFLAKE.2 — BUG-032 generation-guard test made deterministic

`SessionLifecycleGenerationTests.endThenRestart_staleOrphanDoesNotMutateNewSession` failed on **every** full `swift test --package-path PhospheneEngine` run (3/3) while passing 3/3 in isolation in 2.7 s — a test that fails every run trains us to skim red output, which is how a real regression gets waved through. Same slip-class shape TESTFLAKE.1 fixed across the rest of the suite; this suite was missed.

The guard was verified correct before the test was touched, per the standing caveat that a load-only failure can be a real race. `streamingSessionGen`, the post-`await` staleness check, and every `currentPlan`/state write are all `@MainActor`-isolated with **no suspension point between check and act**, so check-then-act is atomic under any amount of concurrency. Nothing in `Sources/` changed.

The test, not the code, held the wrong assumption: two 10 s `waitUntil` wall-clock polls plus a 2.5 s "sleep past 3 × 600 ms of session A's prep" gap. Under parallel load the case stretched to 73–89 s, the polls starved, and the assertions read session A's stale 3-track plan (`tracks.count → 3` vs 2) before session B's had been installed. Per the deterministic-over-budget-widening rule (CLEAN.7.9 → TESTFLAKE.1), the timing assumption is **removed, not widened**: `startSession` already returns with state and plan installed synchronously, so the polls were never needed (both tests now simply `await` it), and the 2.5 s sleep is replaced by awaiting session A's *actual* orphaned prep task, captured before `endSession()` drops the handle. The assertion is now the behaviour the guard promises — *whenever* the orphan fires, its completion is rejected — rather than *when* it fires. `SessionReadyWait` gained an `awaitPrepTask(_:)` overload for a captured handle, keeping TESTFLAKE.1's 120 s hang-cap race so a slip-class flake is never converted into a hang-class one.

Isolated runtime 2.7 s → **0.042 s**; green in 4 consecutive full-suite runs (previously 0/3). Test-only, no production delta.

### [dev-2026-07-24-152242] VL-PSY.2 — Volumetric Lithograph performance fix (BUG-073)

Matt's live session `2026-07-24T14-47-41Z`: VL took ~8 s of black to appear, then ran "very choppy and moving much too slow." The look was fine — the cost was not. Session `features.csv` put VL at **1.0 fps (986 ms/frame)** while Staged Sandbox held **59.9 fps in the same window**, through the same real-time stem separation: VL's own fault, not the machine.

Root cause, and the documentation that would have prevented it was inside the file being called: `warped_fbm` is 7 × fbm8 ≈ 56 Perlin evaluations and `DomainWarp.metal`'s header says "use per-hit or per-vertex only." VL-PSY.1 called it **twice** in `vl_foldDomain`, reached from `sceneSDF` — evaluated ~128 march steps + 4 normal + 3 AO taps per pixel, so ~15,000 Perlin evaluations per pixel. New `VLBudgetProbeTests` measured **1120 ms p95** against a 0.44 ms Lumen Mosaic control.

Fixed to **9.4 ms p95** (v9.4 baseline on the same probe: 7.6 ms): a 2-octave `fbm3D` warp (4 evals, not 112 — the warp only ever needed to be a low-frequency displacement breaking the mirror tiling's identical cells); step scale 0.35 → 0.55, re-reasoned rather than re-guessed, since `pModPolar`/`pModMirror2` are isometries that add no Lipschitz cost; octaves 5 → 4. Octaves 3 was tried and **reverted** — below SHADER_CRAFT's ≥4 floor the render went soft and airbrushed, a quality regression for ~1 ms.

Recorded rather than papered over: VL is still the catalog's most expensive preset at 21.9 ms p95 @1080p, and **v9.4 was already 14.7 ms** — it has never met the ~5 ms budget or its declared `complexity_cost.tier2` of 2.0. The sidecar now carries measured numbers so the Orchestrator schedules against reality, and the probe gates at 12 ms as a regression guard, not an aspiration that fails on day one.

"Moving too slow" had a second, separate cause: `VL_NOISE_TIME_SCALE` 0.015 was tuned in v3.2 for the *superseded naturalistic* direction, giving a terrain phase advance of 0.0014/s against the measured audio-time rate — frozen. Raised 10×; camera dolly 1.8 → 5.0 u/s (at 1.8 the flight crossed a fold cell every ~14 s, which reads as hovering, and the flight is VL's identity). Motion gate after: 0 spikes, 0 frozen.

### [dev-2026-07-23-211701] VL.1 — Volumetric Lithograph rebuild session 1: design doc adopted + multi-frame ray-march harness

Matt reset Volumetric Lithograph (2026-07-23): the shipped v9.4 reads as "a topographic map that adds and removes depth," not the psychedelic linocut its label claimed. `docs/presets/VOLUMETRIC_LITHOGRAPH_DESIGN.md` is adopted as the spec of record for a near-rebuild — an endless forward flight through terrain whose *geometry* folds and kaleidoscopes with the music — superseding the naturalistic SHADER_CRAFT §10.5 / V.11 direction. This increment is arc **step 1 only**: the multi-frame harness before any shader work (PRESET_SESSION_CHECKLIST Part 2 obligation 1). `VolumetricLithographRayMarchHarnessTest` copy-adapts the D-182 `RayMarchPathHarnessTemplate`, drives 60 silence frames through the live `RayMarchPipeline.render` seam, and locks a golden composite dHash (`0x13CFC77D5EB3A349`, mean luma 0.35 — D-037 alive). A/B validated: perturbing the terrain phase axis drifts it 23 bits. Two findings — the template's set-once `sceneUniforms` misses the live per-frame `sceneParamsA.x` write that drives VL's whole world (now mirrored), and VL is **fully frozen at silence** (0 bits drift over 60 frames) because `accumulatedAudioTime` is energy-gated, contradicting both the design doc's §4 "slow-breathing" silence state and the reference README's "never freezes" claim — deferred to arc step 5. Arc steps 0 and 2–5 remain blocked on two open decisions: SDF.1 hg_sdf vendoring, and the §7 psychedelic reference re-curation (a hard pre-flight gate on any shader tuning).
### [dev-2026-07-24-014631] BUG072.1 — app test runner launch failure diagnosed (running app blocks the XCTest host)

`xcodebuild -scheme PhospheneApp test` had been failing machine-wide at exit 65 — "Could not launch “PhospheneAppTests”… The LaunchServices launcher has returned an error" — with zero tests executed, while `build` and `build-for-testing` both succeeded. It reproduced across the primary checkout, worktrees, and HEAD~1, and survived `lsregister -f -R -trusted` and a bundle delete+rebuild, which made it look like an Xcode/macOS environment regression. It was neither. **Root cause: a running instance of the app under test blocks the test-host launch.** The test host *is* `PhospheneApp.app`, and `Info.plist` sets `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` (added at U.11 so the `phosphene://` OAuth callback routes to the one running instance) — so LaunchServices refuses the second instance regardless of which DerivedData path it comes from. Every build-side remedy missed it because the blocker is a *running process*, not a build product. Unified log confirms `PhospheneApp` PID 35320 was alive 15:47:07–18:19:18 on 2026-07-23 and every `test` invocation in that window failed at runner launch (the 16:47 run's xcresult: `failedTests: 1, passedTests: 0`); runs after it exited pass. Proven by A/B/A: 3 consecutive green runs (403 tests, exit 0) → `open PhospheneApp.app` → same command fails exit 65 verbatim → quit → green again.

No app-side change: `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` stays (removing it breaks OAuth callback routing and lets a test host contend with a live session for the system-audio tap). The remediation is to quit the app first (`osascript -e 'tell application "PhospheneApp" to quit'; pkill -x PhospheneApp`), now documented in `RUNBOOK.md §Build and Test`. The repo-side fix is diagnostic: `Scripts/closeout_evidence.sh` Step 2 detects the signature and annotates the block — "BUG-072 — not a test regression. PhospheneApp is running; quit it and re-run." when an instance is live, and "Runner launch failed with no PhospheneApp running — unlike BUG-072. Investigate." when it is not. That re-arms the merge gate: a stray app instance can no longer masquerade as an app-test regression, and the *unexplained* variant is called out as a distinct defect. `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` BUG-072 resolved with the full measurement trail.

### [dev-2026-07-22-180003] CR.2 — Cymatic Resonance REBUILT as vibrating sand (D-199)

Matt's 3rd live M7 rejected the CR.1 figure-shader at the concept level: no clear music connection, and it showed the RESULT of resonance (a static nodal figure) rather than the PHENOMENON the references are about (a plate vibrating, sand jumping and re-forming); the static "dots" read as shoddy construction. After escalating (2+ M7s, root cause finally articulable + changed — not another tuning pass), Matt chose to rebuild as vibrating sand. CR is now a `feedback+particles` preset: ~400K glowing sand grains do the vibration-driven random walk (Zhou et al. 2017; ported from luciopaiva/chladni per FA #73, at Matt's prompting that "this is a solved problem") on the plus-basis eigenmode field — grains shimmer at the antinodes, collect on the nodal lines, and on a mode change scatter and re-collect into the new figure. Direct/visible music coupling: loudness -> vibration amplitude, bass_dev -> beat burst, spectral_centroid -> which mode, tonal_phase_fifths -> jewel hue. New `CymaticSandGeometry` + `CymaticSand.metal` (on the Physarum/Filigree particle template); the CR.1 direct figure-shader, `CymaticResonanceState`, and `CymaticResonanceVisualTests` are retired; the CR PresetRegression golden removed (black-ground particle preset, like Filigree). Registered in `ParticleGeometryRegistry` (removed from `StatefulRuntimeRegistry`). Look/motion proven on a synthetic arc (Matt: "looks better, shows promise") via `CymaticSandSketchRenderTests`; pending a live M7 against real music. Full rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-199.

### [dev-2026-07-22-171333] CR.1.2 — Cymatic Resonance second-M7 fixes: top-down, varied ladder, harmonic hue (D-198)

Second live M7 (track "Cherub Rock", **clean** chain — which also validated the D-197 "degraded only after loud" gate: 0 low/critical windows, `verdict=clean`). Three fixes: (1) **top-down orthographic cover-fit** camera replaces the oblique tilt — the square plate fills the 16:9 frame edge-to-edge with no receding background (Matt: "camera directly above would be better"). (2) **More pattern variety** ("only 3 patterns, boring") — centroid-deviation gain 8→12 (wider traversal) + a varied same-parity ladder (`(1,3)(2,2)(2,4)(3,3)(3,5)(4,4)(2,6)(4,6)(5,5)(3,7)(5,7)`, alternating `m=n` concentric with `m<n` cross-hatch) so rungs read as distinct figures — verified in render: peanut → concentric-ring → 4-fold cloverleaf. (3) **Colour responds to music** ("the sand colour doesn't change") — a global jewel-hue offset from the smoothed harmonic phase `tonal_phase_fifths` (D-178; fully alive on the track at range 6.25), circular-smoothed via sin/cos + atan2; brought forward from CR.3. Snap depth 0.9→0.65 (top-down makes the lowest modes read empty). Golden regenerated; the `tonalPhaseFifths` route declared + green in RouteCoverage. Pending Matt's next live M7. Full rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-198.

### [dev-2026-07-22-164935] ASH — "degraded only after loud" gate (D-197 follow-up, Matt-approved)

Follow-up to CR.1.1's ASH work: a quiet song intro (e.g. "Hummer" at −24 dBFS) no longer reads as a degraded chain on either surface. Both now require the chain to have been observed `band=healthy` (loud) at least once before a `band=low`/`band=critical` window counts as degradation. Live nudge: `PlaybackErrorBridge.hasSeenHealthyChain` latch. Post-session verdict: `ChainAnalyzer.LogScan.bandLowAfterHealthy` (a low/critical SIGNAL_HEALTH line AFTER the first healthy one — lines are chronological) replaces the old "any low/critical line" check. A never-loud chain (genuinely dead/silent from the start) is unaffected — it's covered by the dead-tap card + silence-extended path, not this nudge. Tests: `test_lowBeforeHealthy_doesNotNudge` (app), `quietIntroDoesNotFlagBandLow` (engine); the existing band-low tests now include a leading healthy window. D-197.

### [dev-2026-07-22-163822] CR.1 + CR.1.1 — Cymatic Resonance preset added, then first-M7 defect fixes (D-196 / D-197)

**CR.1 (D-196)** added Cymatic Resonance — a resonant square-plate Chladni nodal figure selected live by spectral centroid (mode-complexity ladder), `bassDev` snap-to-simple, derived-normal relief + GGX + jewel emissive on deep black through ACES + bloom. **First `direct`+`post_process` preset**: slot-6 per-preset state now reaches `PostProcessChain.runScenePass` (byte-identical for all existing presets — that path had no prior consumer). Count 25→26, `certified:false`. Maquette-stage concept-gate correction #5: the plus basis forces an anti-diagonal nodal line for opposite-parity (m,n), so the ladder is the same-parity `(m,m+2)` family `(1,3)…(11,13)` (diagonal-free).

**CR.1.1 (D-197)** — Matt's first live M7 (track "Hummer") surfaced three preset issues + one infra gap, all diagnosed from the session capture before any code change:
- **"Held its pattern, no blooms."** Real `spectral_centroid` is ~0.08–0.18, not 0–1 (verified: healthy-portion p5 0.085 / p95 0.162), so the `centroid×(N−1)` map moved the ladder < 1 of 11 rungs (the Nimbus/BUG-027 AGC-calibration trap on the hero driver). Fixed with a centroid-DEVIATION-from-baseline + absolute-tilt **blend** (Matt's call). Regression-locked: the real narrow band now traverses 3.75 rungs (was < 1).
- **"White with a hint of magenta."** Emissive 2.6→1.5 (ridge near the bloom threshold so hue survives ACES), white key → warm-gold, hue sweep widened → sapphire→magenta→gold.
- **"Lots of white space."** Plate zoomed (camDist 2.75→1.85, plateHalf 1.0→1.18, elev 52→48) to fill the 16:9 canvas.
- **ASH `.critical`-nudge gap.** Matt: "the toast did not fire." ASH *did* grade the capture `degraded` and logged live `band=critical` — but `PlaybackErrorBridge` gated the low-levels nudge on `peakBand == .low` only, and the quiet-intro state was `.critical` (worse, unwired). Both bands now nudge. Open ASH follow-up (Matt's call, not folded): a quiet song intro reads as degraded on both the live nudge and the post-session verdict — a "degraded only after loud" gate would cut the false alarms.

Golden regenerated (palette/framing/emissive changed the silence-fundamental render). **Captured on a `degraded` chain → CR.1.1 is code-complete pending a clean-chain live re-M7**; the hero fix is proven against the real centroid distribution regardless. Full rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-196 / D-197.

### [dev-2026-07-20-000000] KSRETIRE.1 — Kinetic Sculpture preset retired (D-188)

Kinetic Sculpture is retired in its entirety (Matt's call, 2026-07-20). **Why retired:** after several redesigns the preset never found the right direction — the chrome-in-a-gallery look (the KSRB.1 geometry rebuild + the Phase RMENV material lift built to serve it) read as a "tinker toy," and a subsequent psychedelic-iridescent pivot drifted into a different concept rather than fixing KS. A fresh psychedelic-geometry preset will be authored separately, from a new spec. Deleted: `KineticSculpture.metal`, `KineticSculpture.json`, `KineticSculptureTests`, the KS-only `KineticSculptureMotionGifHarness`, `docs/presets/KINETIC_SCULPTURE_DESIGN.md`, and `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/kinetic_sculpture/`. Wiring: `expectedProductionPresetCount` 26 → 25 (certified 14, unchanged by this retirement — KS was never certified); `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate` KS entry removed; `PresetRegressionTests` KS golden + KSRB.1 comment removed; `PresetVisualReviewTests` / `MaxDurationFrameworkTests` KS rows removed; `SessionRecorderTests` log literal repointed to Lumen Mosaic; shared-path comments that named only KS (`RayMarch.metal`, `IBL.metal`, `PresetDescriptor+SceneUniforms.swift`, app `VisualizerEngine+Audio.swift`) generalized. **GoldenSessionTests regenerated deterministically** — Session C track 2 falls KS → Membrane (runner-up mid-energy fit); every other slot byte-identical (single runner-up substitution, not a planning regression). **Phase RMENV (D-187) engine work is RETAINED** — the multi-light `SceneUniforms`, `ibl_env`/gallery, per-preset background, and `MultiLightSceneUniformsTests` + `IBLEnvironmentTests` are all kept as a completed opt-in capability with no production consumer yet (KS was the intended first consumer); it awaits a future ray-march preset, per Matt — not deleted as dead. The shared ray-march path (Volumetric Lithograph, Test Sphere) is untouched. Recover from git history if the concept is revived. Full rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-188.

### [dev-2026-07-19-170405] GBRETIRE.1 — Glass Brutalist preset retired (D-186)

Glass Brutalist — Phosphene's original ray-march scene preset and the subject of D-020 — is retired in its entirety per the 2026-07-19 concept-viability-gate decision (Milestone D roster survey). **Why retired, not tuned:** D-020 (architecture-stays-solid) deliberately keeps the concrete audio-static, so the hero subject can never be an instrument — the musical role is structurally hollow (Gate 1 fail); the board-form-concrete look is also 2006-tier (Gate 2 fail; the V.12 rebuild was scoped then abandoned). Deleted: `GlassBrutalist.metal`, `GlassBrutalist.json`, `GlassBrutalistTests`, the GB-only `RayMarchSDFDiagnosticTests`, the `GlassBrutalistValidationTests` suite inside `RayMarchDiagnosticTests`, and `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/glass_brutalist/`. Wiring: `expectedProductionPresetCount` 27 → 26; `FidelityRubricTests.expectedAutomatedGate` GB entry removed; `PresetRegressionTests` / `PresetVisualReviewTests` / `MaxDurationFrameworkTests` GB rows removed; app `cameraDollySpeed` GB case dropped (default 0). **GoldenSessionTests fixtures regenerated deterministically** — Waveform (sole `waveform`-family preset) inherits GB's mellow-jazz slots (Session B → Waveform×5; Session C reslots), the same sole-family clustering already documented for Membrane in Session A; not a planning regression. The shared ray-march path (Kinetic Sculpture, Volumetric Lithograph, `RayMarch.metal` / `IBL.metal`, generic `SceneUniformsConstructionTests`) is untouched; the `.ssgi` pass + `SceneUniforms.cameraForward.w` free lane stay on the GPU contract though no production preset now uses them. D-020 stays Accepted (governs any future architectural ray-march preset) with a retirement pointer. Recover from git history if the concept is ever revived from a new spec. Full rationale: `docs/DECISIONS.md` D-186.
### [dev-2026-07-20-012536] AV.7 — Aurora Veil reauthored as a faithful nimitz port, CERTIFIED

Aurora Veil is now a faithful MSL port of nimitz's "Auroras" (Shadertoy `XtGGRt`, 2017) rather than a derivation from it, and is **certified** on Matt's M7 sign-off. Five AV rounds of accretion (Lawlor footprint `F(x)`, three parallax columns, band undulation, drum kink, traveling waves) are deleted; so is the drift that had crept into the recipe itself — the 3D ray march had been flattened to a fake 2D column, `triNoise2d` had grown a global time rotation nimitz never had, and the gain had been raised 1.8 → 2.4. The port restores his algorithm and constants, adapted only for the harness.

Matt then re-framed it live: a **static upward view** of the sky, with the horizon, ground and reflection removed. The slow camera pan was deleted rather than slowed — `stars()` is indexed by view direction, so any camera motion scintillates the entire starfield; removing it resolved both "stars twinkle too much" and "don't like the slow camera movement" at once.

Reactivity is three non-competing axes: stars keep the **downbeat** (`bar_phase01`, gated by `pulse_amp01`, flash-safe by sparse footprint), brightness **breathes with the mood envelope** (`arousal`, clamped 0.85–1.15, plus a subordinate smoothed-bass lift on `bass_att_rel`), and colour **warms with the mood** (`valence` shifting the whole palette phase).

Gates: automated rubric `[✓] 3/4` (L4 is manual by definition), flash-safety **MEASURED at 0.00 flashes/s**, regression goldens regenerated (the old hashes were 32–38 Hamming bits away — a different image by design, not drift). Obsolete gates were re-pointed rather than dropped: the vocal-pitch→hue test is now the mood-colour test, the bass-dominance test is now "bass lift stays subordinate to the mood breathe", and the silence stratification test asserts green-over-red plus altitude colour spread instead of the deleted horizon composition.

★ Durable findings (D-185): mood envelopes, not deviation primitives, are the right driver for a *gentle* response — `bass_dev` measures spiky (p50 = 0, max 2.3) and `mid`/`treb` deviations are near-flat on real music; `bass_att_rel` is the gentle deviation primitive that satisfies the L2 continuous-energy gate without CPU-side smoothing; a crown-only colour shift is perceptually invisible under nimitz's `exp2(-i*0.065-2.5)` weighting; and beat-sync legibility is a property of the grid, not only the mapping — the same star mapping read as unsynced on reverb-washed dream-pop and locked correctly on Cherub Rock.

nimitz's source is CC-BY-NC-SA and Phosphene is MIT; the port ships **credited** on Matt's explicit call. Follow-up: `AuroraVeilState.swift` and its three driver suites are now dead code (the shader ignores buffer(6)) and `AuroraVeilRoutes.swift` still describes the deleted three-channel set — left in place to bound the increment.

### [dev-2026-07-13-011211] PUB.10 — R3.2: CaptureStateSurface, decomposition slice 2 of 5

The capture/signal-chain trio (`audioSignalState`, `signalHealth` [ASH.1], `hasScreenCapturePermission`) becomes `CaptureStateSurface`, per the R3.1 recipe: `private(set)` + semantic mutators + `dispatchPrecondition(.onQueue(.main))`; read-only forwarders keep the historical names; the R3.1 bridge becomes one merged objectWillChange subscription. 4 writer sites converted, each preserving its exact thread-hop shape (the tap callback and `onHealthChanged` writers keep their `Task { @MainActor }` hops; the two `startAudio`-path permission writes were already main). Publisher injection moves to `engine.captureState.$…` (ContentView ×2, PlaybackView ×2, FirstAudioDetector doc citation). **Task-1 membership call: `isCapturing` stays engine-side** — its writers are the 'C'-key CSV feature-capture toggle, a diagnostics flag no view or publisher consumes; a later diagnostics slice can take it. 3 contract tests; app 401 green; lint 0. Remaining: R3.3 (analysis), R3.4 (LF transport), R3.5 (orchestrator bridge — the cross-thread-delicate one, its own session). Also backfilled the missing PUB.9 EP entry (that session's EP edit never landed in `17b22ee`).

### [dev-2026-07-12-223804] PUB.9 — R3.1: NowPlayingSurface, the first VisualizerEngine decomposition slice

The four now-playing chrome fields become a dedicated child ObservableObject (`NowPlayingSurface`) with `private(set)` publication + semantic mutators — `publishTrack` pairs title+index (artwork optionally same-tick; the streaming shape clears it), `clear()` is THE session-boundary drop. Structurally closes the BUG-024 write-without-clear class for these fields. Churn contained by design: read-only forwarders keep ~20 read sites unchanged; the compiler's rejection of every write is how all 13 writer sites were found and converted (streaming track-change → one paired publish; LF surface publish → one call); the child's objectWillChange bridges into the engine's. 2 contract tests; app 398 green. **R3 continuation plan (each slice = the same recipe: child + private(set) + mutators + forwarders + bridge + compiler-found writers):** R3.2 capture state (isCapturing, hasScreenCapturePermission, audioSignalState, signalHealth), R3.3 analysis surface (currentMood, estimatedKey/Tempo, mirDiag), R3.4 LF transport (isLocalFilePaused, localFileCacheBytes, lastEndedLocalFileOrigin), R3.5 orchestrator bridge (livePlannedSession + the orchestratorLock trio — the delicate one, cross-thread). Fresh session recommended per slice pair.

### [dev-2026-07-12-213128] PUB.8 — R2: stateful preset runtimes get their one dispatch point

applyPreset's seven name-keyed CPU-state blocks (Arachne ×2, Gossamer, Skein, Aurora Veil, Nimbus, Lumen Mosaic) — scattered through the paradigm arms since their respective increments — collapse into a single tail switch `bindStatefulPresetRuntime(for:)` + six verbatim bind methods (the proven D-097 `resolveParticleGeometry` shape). A contributor's stateful preset is now one case + one method. Order contract documented (tail runs after every arm; slot binds + tick are sticky and paradigm-agnostic — the Aurora Veil/Nimbus precedent). Findings along the way: the mv_warp-arm Arachne copy was DEAD code (Arachne is staged-only; the live staged body with its D-095 `reset()` is the unified binder), and Lumen previously skipped binding if rayMarch pipeline creation failed (now binds regardless — strictly more correct). FFO (bake entanglement) and Nacre/Floret/Glaze (stateless; bundle flags + sidecar `feedback_pixel_format`) are documented non-candidates. New engine-side `StatefulRuntimeRegistry` + rename-gate test (a sidecar rename without a switch update would silently zero the preset's state buffers). Output-preserving: goldens + flash + photosensitivity + dispatch suites green. **Follow-up candidate:** Nimbus's `setDirectRenderScale(0.5)` inside its binder could become a sidecar `render_scale` key (the PUB.4 `feedback_pixel_format` pattern). Remaining Claude-side review work: R3 VisualizerEngine decomposition only.

### [dev-2026-07-12-180557] PUB.7 — ultra-review Phase 2: the contributor experience ships

**Hot-reload is LIVE (Matt's Decision 4):** the loader now watches `~/Library/Application Support/Phosphene/Presets` — every save of a `.metal`/`.json` pair recompiles and swaps in live; a broken save toasts via the new `onPresetLoadFailed` → PUB.5 one-shot channel while the last-good compile keeps rendering. **The P1 GPU-contract doc fix:** ARCHITECTURE §Key Types no longer marks live fields as padding — field-verified: FeatureVector has NO free floats (39–48 = trackElapsedS + D-153 pulse quartet + D-178 TIV quintet); StemFeatures' only free floats are 56–64. **SHADER_CRAFT §17 completed** — every key PresetDescriptor decodes (incl. the mv_warp-required `fragment_function`), plus a correction the new gate forced: §17's own `family` row advertised values (`abstract`) the strict PresetCategory enum rejects — an unknown family throws the WHOLE sidecar decode and the preset silently degrades to defaults. **RUNBOOK certification procedure now matches practice** (M7 load-bearing; meetsAutomatedGate not a prerequisite; the certified test-table steps spelled out). **New contributor docs:** GLOSSARY.md, presets/NEW_PRESET_CHECKLIST.md (every registration point, lifecycle-ordered), presets/YOUR_FIRST_PRESET.md — a complete ~60-line pair that `DocsExampleCompileTests` extracts and compiles through the real PresetLoader every run, so the first-contact example can't drift (the gate caught 2 real doc bugs on its first run: MSL snake_case + the family enum). Perf-suite hardware baseline: satisfied by the README caveat (the review's option A) — the closeout battery keeps perf coverage by default. With PUB.7, review Phase 2 is COMPLETE; remaining Claude-side work = R2 PresetRuntime registry + R3 VisualizerEngine decomposition.

### [dev-2026-07-12-162153] PUB.6 — deferred Phase-1 closed: BUG-070 truthful reinstall state, shared iTunes limiter, D-056 dead branch

**BUG-070 (fix landed, live-validation pending):** a failed device-change tap reinstall left `_isCapturing=true` with zero callbacks — engine detectors starved (SignalHealthMonitor.evaluate is sample-driven, deadTap can never confirm) and recovery restarts blocked at the alreadyCapturing guard; only the app-layer poll-based stall card surfaced it. The catch now clears `_isCapturing` and keeps the monitor as a diagnostic beacon; the false "create steps stopped the monitor" comment corrected. The 3-queue lifecycle interleave stays DELIBERATELY unserialized (static-only evidence vs the G1-12/12-validated path = BUG-063 pattern; existing breadcrumbs are the instrumentation — serialize only on a reproduced artifact). **iTunes:** `ITunesRateLimiter` (verbatim extraction of the resolver's window) now shared by PreviewResolver AND the previously-unthrottled ITunesSearchFetcher; MetadataPreFetcher coalesces concurrent same-key prefetches onto one in-flight task (+regression: 3 overlapping callers → 1 fetch). **D-056:** the unreachable `.partial`-with-profile readiness qualification deleted — no path ever stored a cache entry for a partial track, and its test synthesized the impossible state; doc comment records what making the intent real would take. With this, every ultra-review Phase-1 item is either fixed or deliberately-open with rationale in the tracker.

### [dev-2026-07-12-155848] PUB.5 — ultra-review Phase-1 remainder: C7 dissolved-with-enforcement, LF failures surfaced, timeout escape fixed

**C7 (renderFrame preset-apply race) resolved by investigation, not mechanism:** draw(in:)/renderFrame are @MainActor on MTKView's default main-thread display link, applyPreset is synchronous, and every off-main caller hops via DispatchQueue.main.async — a frame cannot observe a torn snapshot on today's code. What was actually wrong: two contradictory threading comments (a "display-link thread" that doesn't exist; a "render thread" for halfResTexture) and an unenforced contract. Fixed the comments; `dispatchPrecondition(.onQueue(.main))` at applyPreset entry now trips any future off-main caller in Debug (the BUG-060/061 class); halfResTexture needs no lock under the enforced model. **LF playback failures reach the user** (both router start-failure paths were log-only → silent PlaybackView): new `UserFacingError.localFilePlaybackFailed` + one-shot engine error channel → §9.4 toast; session-start failure ends to EndedView with re-pick CTAs; mid-queue failure commits the index, toasts the file name, and advances past the broken entry. UX_SPEC §9.4 row + externalized strings + 2 bridge regressions. **The spec'd 2-minute preparation escape was unreachable dead code** (Rule 4's >90s banner returned first) — severe timeout now checked first, 2 deterministic regressions. Also: DOC.6 rotation (Phase PHYS crossed the 14-day line at midnight — the gate-rot class's 2nd bite; mechanization per D-161 rule 3 is now on the table). **Deliberately NOT done: tap-lifecycle serialization + dead-man switch** — restructuring a live-validated-robust path (G1 12/12) on static-only evidence is the BUG-063 pattern; queued for a dedicated instrumentation-first session. Also queued: iTunes shared rate limiter, D-056 unreachable-branch decision.

### [dev-2026-07-12-153611] PUB.4 — ultra-review Phase 4: refactoring (R1 + R4 landed; R2/R3 scoped + queued)

**R1 — GPU behaviour off display-name matching:** new `feedback_pixel_format` sidecar key (`rgba16Float` | `bgra8Unorm`; unknown → warn + drawable, the rubric_profile pattern) decoded on `PresetDescriptor`, consulted first by `PresetLoader.feedbackFormat`; the four shipped overrides (Fata Morgana / Nacre / Floret / Glaze) now declared in their sidecars, name matches demoted to deprecated fallback. A rename can no longer silently put Nacre's float pipeline on an 8-bit drawable (the BUG-061 crash class), and contributors opt into HDR feedback without engine edits. Output-preserving: PresetRegression goldens (27 cases) + multi-pass flash harness green; SHADER_CRAFT §17 row added. **R4 — honesty/deletion bundle:** the 5 ceremony protocols deleted (ReactiveOrchestrating, LiveAdapting, SessionPlanning, AudioBuffering, StemFFTEngineProtocol — single conformer, never used as a type, no double; real seams keep theirs); dead `OnboardingReset` duplicate deleted (pbxproj 8 refs removed); FFTMagnitudeKernel's "single source of truth" claim softened + both surviving hand-copies annotated at their sites (GridOnsetCalibrator formula-identical; StemAnalyzer's 16× scale DELIBERATE — AGC-seed-calibrated); Package.swift executable section points at AUDIT_KEEPLIST; `cancel_fromReady` converted to the deterministic `sessionPreparationTask.value` wait (starvation-not-hang confirmed first; 5/5 green). **Queued:** R2 `PresetRuntime` registry (L — D-097 generalization of the 3 name-keyed app-layer sites) and R3 VisualizerEngine decomposition (XL — CLEAN Phase 8) each need a dedicated session; review Phase 2 (contributor UX incl. hot-reload wiring) remains.

### [dev-2026-07-12-013608] PUB.3 — ultra-review Phase 3: documentation reconciliation landed

The docs-only pass. **KNOWN_ISSUES pruned to truth:** 24 resolved entries filed out of §Open (17 rotated straight to history), the Open Index is now the actual 11-item open list. Verified closes: BUG-026 (fixed by ASH.2's health toast, D-184), BUG-043 (retired per its own no-recurrence criterion), BUG-025 (subsumed by AGC3.5 — the onset-window fast-attack floor is exactly the session-first-onset transient it tracked), BUG-014 (index reconciled with its own resolved entry), AUDIT-2026-06-09's four "remaining P2" bullets (all CLEAN.3.x-fixed, re-verified in code today). BUG-001/005/013 reclassified to a new §Known Limitations (external/by-construction). **BUG-041 stays open** — annotated as candidate close-as-stale, needs Matt's one-line confirm. **Cross-doc staleness batch:** BEAT_SYNC's dangling links to the DOC.4-moved cold-start section, SHADER_CRAFT's flash-gate claim (now describes the shipped dual harness), check_user_strings.sh's phantom Dashboard allowlist, the retired MV-1 pivot formula in MIRPipeline docs, SessionManager's fused cancel() doc, the D-170 SectionDetector ghost comment, registry route count 156→157 (+pointer at the live source), two archived EP paths. **FidelityRubric lock completed:** expectedAutomatedGate backfilled 18→27 sidecars at measured values + a completeness assertion so a new sidecar can't land unlocked. DocIntegrity 12/12; rubric 29/29; lint 0.

### [dev-2026-07-11-214904] PUB.2 — ultra-review Phase-1 code defects: both P1s + five P2-class fixes landed

Matt's "start Phase 1" go. **BUG-068 RESOLVED** (`22ded35`+`1ae6900`): LF multi-file plans were assembled `cachedTracks + failedTracks`, so a mid-queue prep failure reordered the plan against the positional URL queue — every later track played one file's audio against another track's identity/beat grid/chrome; plans now build from the order-preserving `orderedTracks` (`PrepOutcomes` accumulator), regression test red-arms the old concat. **BUG-069 RESOLVED** (`3d89692`): `VisualizerEngine.currentFamilySeries` (heap Array, MainActor reassign vs ~94 Hz analysisQueue read — memory-unsafe) + 3 sibling scalars now route through `analysisStateLock` accessors; MIRPipeline's recording track-metadata pair got `trackMetadataLock`. Also landed: session-boundary clear for ALL session-scoped surfaces on `.connecting` AND `.preparing` (BUG-024 class — stale `livePlan`/chrome/`preFetchedProfile` could leak across sessions; LF entry never emits `.connecting`); the Spotify error-state "Try Again" button was a verifier-confirmed no-op (`.preview` guard) — new `retry()` re-attempts with the stored playlist ID (+2 regressions); PreviewResolver no longer nil-poisons its cache on transient 429/5xx (D-061(d) recovery can now succeed; 2 regressions pin both sides); SessionPreparer's two exit-nils of `preparationTask` dropped (LF.5.fix.3-B pattern — an out-of-order return could orphan a newer recovery loop uncancellable); live tempo halving threshold 160→175 unified with `BeatGrid.halvingThresholdBPM` (comments claimed parity; fast-rock ~158–174 BPM was halved to ~85 in reactive mode only); BeatThis reflect-pad OOB for sub-513-sample inputs guarded; ChromaExtractor key-stabilization now wall-clock (was 60 fps frame-count — BUG-066 unit-mismatch class). **Queued for a fresh session** (riskier / live-validation-bound): tap-lifecycle serialization + failed-reinstall dead-man switch, renderFrame atomic preset snapshot + halfResTexture lock, LF router-failure §9 surfacing + preparation-timeout reorder, iTunes shared rate limiter.

### [dev-2026-07-11-185141] PUB.1 — Publication Phase 0 landed (publish blockers off the ultra review)

Matt greenlit the four recommendations from the pre-publication ultra review and Phase 0 shipped as `[PUB.1]` (branch `claude/phosphene-codebase-review-4303dc`, unpushed): MIT LICENSE; README + CONTRIBUTING front door; D-111 Milkdrop attribution actually fulfilled — the sweep found **five** Milkdrop-inspired presets (Nacre, Glaze, Floret, **DragonBloom, FataMorgana** — two more than the review flagged), each now carrying the D-111-as-amended `inspired_by` sidecar block, CREDITS table populated, and the committed `dragon_bloom/source.milk` deleted per the no-`.milk`-redistribution scope condition (SHA-256 kept as provenance); privacy sweep (memory/, audio_tap blob, email redaction, portable hook, .gif LFS rule) with the **corpus manifests restored mid-session on Matt's direction** — they stay; `Scripts/fetch_weights.sh` + SHA256SUMS staging the weights LFS→Release cutover; DOC.6 rotation (the doc gate was red on main); `docs/PUBLISHING.md` runbook for the maintainer-executed cutover incl. the now-optional history rewrite and the **open D-113 trigger** (publication reopens the retired Milkdrop author-notification question — needs Matt's pick). Remediation Phases 1–4 of the review remain queued.

### [dev-2026-07-09-194500] BUG-029 RESOLVED — AGC3.5 cold-start fix confirmed live

Closed BUG-029. Matt's live M7 on a correctly-built app (session `2026-07-09T19-33-09Z`, Wake Up + Ferrofluid Ocean): **"Smooth"** — no pop-and-drop. Objective corroboration on that real session: onset worst band **0.875** (pre-fix 4.8), peak f.bass **0.798** (pre-fix 4.4), FFO `fo_spike` **1.64/1.14** — the AGC-scale blowup is gone; the small residual is Wake Up's genuinely loud opening riff reading loud, which is correct. **Process note:** the *first* "fixed" session still showed 23× — that build was `ricercar-rework` (no fix), not `origin/main`. Rather than assume a fix defect, I replayed its exact `raw_tap.wav` through the fixed code (worst band 1.05, not 4.8), proving the build lacked the fix; the rebuild confirmed. Both halves of the non-waivable gate (Matt's eyes + the measurement) now agree.

### [dev-2026-07-09-181500] AGC3.5 — fast-attack peak floor kills the cold-start f.bass spike (BUG-029, code-complete)

Real fix for BUG-029 after the reopen. **Root cause** (instrumented off Matt's Wake Up / KITM reproducer, not guessed): AGC3.3 seeded `BandEnergyProcessor`'s running average from the first audible frame — the tiny leading edge of a percussive attack — and set `agcScale = 0.5/avg` immediately, while the slow warmup EMA (0.95 = 5 %/frame) lagged the full transient landing ~0.3–0.5 s later, so `f.bass` railed 16–20× with all bands blowing up together. **Fix:** a fast-attack peak floor confined to a 60-frame onset window (opened at a session-start seed or on exit from an inter-track silence hold) — a frame whose energy exceeds 3.5× the running average snaps the average up so the scale can't lag. Window-gated because a first threshold-only version flattened mid-track snares (`FerrofluidBeatSyncTests` caught it in closeout); the window keeps the fast-attack on cold-start only, so mid-track transients get the normal EMA (continuous music byte-identical). **Validated on the real reproducer** (`AGC3RealAudioReplayTests` replays the Wake Up `raw_tap.wav` via env `AGC3_REAL_WAV` — copyrighted audio isn't committed, matching repo policy): cold-start worst band **2.57 → 0.71**, blowup gone. Added a committed **ramped-onset** synthetic reproducer (`agc3_rampedOnset_doesNotBlowUp_liveBandProcessor`) — a real attack ramp that actually triggers the bug (fails at 2.14 un-fixed), unlike the step-function fixture that let the original false-close through (FA #27). Steady-state byte-identical lock green; 114 DSP/mood/MIR tests green. **Not resolved:** BUG-029 stays open pending Matt's live M7 (FFO arriving smoothly on a hard-onset track) — the manual check is non-waivable this time.

### [dev-2026-07-09-030000] MITOSIS-G2.3 — Cytokinesis CERTIFIED (first explicit-cell preset)

Matt's live M7 (session `2026-07-09T02-04-02Z`, track SZ2, ~73 s, clean) signed off Cytokinesis — the detailed fluorescence-microscopy sibling of Mitosis. Certified: sidecar `certified: true`; FidelityRubric `certifiedPresets` + `expectedAutomatedGate: false` (coupling is CPU-side in `MitosisGen2Geometry` — energyEnv→division pace, centroidEnv→palette, drum `hit`→glow accent — invisible to the MSL-source heuristic, per the Mitosis/Filigree/Skein precedent); `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests.multiPassMeasured` + a new real `renderCytokinesis` multi-pass flash harness in `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` — **MEASURED 0.00 flashes/s, SAFE** (luma 0.050–0.366, gradual grow→crowd→dissolve). **Sidecar description corrected for honesty (NACRE.5):** the previous "a drum onset triggers the cytokinesis snap on the beat" was aspirational — the shipped model paces division by sustained energy (autonomous) and uses the drum only for a bounded glow accent; description now matches. The readable-form automated gate was already unblocked (G2.2 gate-precursor). Cert suite 50 tests / 6 suites green; Cytokinesis enters the production rotation.

### [dev-2026-07-09-021500] BUG-029 REOPENED — the prior-entry close was wrong (AGC3.3 fix is partial)

Correcting the record: the BUG-029 close in the entry below was premature and is reverted. The close rested on the synthetic `AGC3ColdStartSpikeTests` fixture (FA #27 — synthetic audio doesn't reproduce real-pipeline behavior) plus one real session that happened to have a soft onset (0.06 s pre-roll → 1.27×, non-representative), and it **waived the entry's required manual check** — exactly the corner that gate existed to prevent. Matt's live M7 (session `2026-07-09T02-04-02Z`, track SZ2, zero pre-roll) reproduces the bug: f.bass spikes **3.964 at te=1.28 s = 14.8×** steady, FFO `fo_spike` **1.80 peak / 1.21 steady** — the pop-and-drop, on `BandEnergyProcessor` byte-identical to `main`. AGC3.3 (`144f824`) only handles soft/pre-rolled onsets. BUG-029 reopened; KNOWN_ISSUES + EP corrected; verification criteria hardened (a hard-onset real-audio case must reproduce the spike before any re-fix, and the manual check is non-waivable). Next: AGC3.5 instrument→diagnose→fix off the SZ2 reproducer. (Cytokinesis readable-form gate unblock from the entry below stands — unrelated.)

### [dev-2026-07-08-224500] BUG-029 closed + Cytokinesis readable-form gate unblocked

Two follow-ups off the pending-item review. **BUG-029 (AGC `f.bass` cold-start spike) RESOLVED** — fix had landed at AGC3.3 (`144f824`); closed now on automated + real-session evidence, with Matt waiving the separate catalog M7. A real post-fix session (`2026-07-08T15-07-53Z`, 10,253 frames) run through `tools/agc3/measure_coldstart_spike.py` shows onset `f.bass` peak 0.287 vs steady 0.225 = **1.27×** (goal <2×), and FFO's `fo_spike` consumer flat at **1.23 pk / 1.19 steady** — a smooth arrival, no pop-and-drop. The real session is single-track (session-start onset); the inter-track onset is covered by `AGC3ColdStartSpikeTests` (10.6×→<2×), not separately eyeballed. **Cytokinesis readable-form gate** — exempted from the fragment-only `test_readableForm_atSteadyEnergy` (`PresetAcceptanceTests`), the same Mitosis-class mis-metric already exempting 8 geometry-pass presets: the harness renders only the flat `mitosisgen2_ground_fragment` (→ formComplexity 1); real coverage is `MitosisGen2GeometryTests` (growth-arc/packing/flash + `renderLook`), confirmed rich via an offline contact sheet. Unblocks the automated gate only — Cytokinesis cert still awaits Matt's live M7. Acceptance suite green; doc gates green.

### [dev-2026-07-08-204511] MOOD-FLUX.3 — one FFT-magnitude formula (BUG-066 mechanized)

Mechanized the BUG-066 class so it can't recur. The window→magnitude formula (Hann → `|FFT|×2/fftSize`) is now one shared `FFTMagnitudeKernel` in `Audio` — an allocation-free, CPU-only class that owns the vDSP FFT setup + per-frame scratch. The live `FFTProcessor` embeds it (RT path stays zero-alloc per frame, BUG-036 guards green); the offline `SessionPreparer.analyzeMIR` constructs one; the `CorpusCensusRunner` census mirror routes through it. **Deleted** all three former copies of the formula — the offline `computeFFTMagnitudes` + `FFTContext` and the census `FFTScratch` — so exactly one implementation remains (also collapsed the duplicated `vDSP_create/destroy_fftsetup` lifecycles into the kernel's init/deinit). Behaviour-preserving (MOOD-FLUX.2 already aligned the values): the new divergence-guard test `fftMagnitudeKernel_matchesLiveFFTProcessorBinForBin` (tied to BUG-066) asserts live == kernel bit-for-bit and would fail if the formula is ever forked again; a parity test asserts kernel == the 440 Hz golden. `MoodClassifierGolden` unchanged; 121 targeted mood/MIR/spectral/session-prep/census/FFT tests green; swiftlint --strict clean on touched files. Chose Approach B (shared kernel) over Approach A (route offline through `FFTProcessor`) — keeps the offline path device-free and avoids per-call GPU-buffer round-trips. Docs-only follow-up left in scope: the DECISIONS sample-rate-delta note (CENSUS.3 measured ~9 %, doc says ~22 %).

### [dev-2026-07-08-152411] BUG-066 RESOLVED — objective mood A/B sign-off (MOOD-FLUX.2)

Closed BUG-066. The live M7 was retired as unfit for a diffuse scoring change; replaced by an objective before/after via `CorpusCensusRunner --mood-ab` (`c871f77`): the real MoodClassifier run production-style on two parallel MIR pipelines (old = magnitudes ×16 pre-fix scale, new = fixed) over an 80-track genre-stratified sample. Before, the saturated flux railed **arousal high for every track** (range [+0.05,+0.99], never negative) → everything read "happy/excited," mood was non-discriminative (Beethoven piano adagios read euphoric). After, arousal spans **[−0.87,+0.81]**, valence/arousal spread ~doubled, and **32 % of tracks flip mood quadrant** in the correct direction (calm tracks finally read calm) → preset selection materially changes for ~a third of the library. Matt: "bug is resolved." Records flipped (KNOWN_ISSUES, EP MOOD-FLUX.2, diagnosis). Follow-up MOOD-FLUX.3 (route offline `analyzeMIR` through `FFTProcessor` so the paths can't drift again) remains queued.

### [dev-2026-07-08-144433] MOOD-FLUX.2 — offline mood flux aligned to the live FFT scale (BUG-066 fixed, pending live M7)

Fixed BUG-066. Investigation corrected the MOOD-FLUX.1 root cause: the mood **model is fine** (retrained on live features Apr 2026, `d586e57`; the live training CSV `~/uzume_features_annotated.csv` flux mean 0.2516 = the scaler exactly). The bug was a **live-vs-offline feature-path divergence** — the offline `SessionPreparer.analyzeMIR.computeFFTMagnitudes` reimplemented the FFT magnitude formula differently from the live `Audio/FFTProcessor`: `sqrt(power/fftSize)` (=|FFT|/32) vs live `|FFT|×2/fftSize` (=|FFT|/512), a uniform **16×**. Spectral flux is the only feature fed **raw** into the MoodClassifier z-score (bands are AGC-normalized, centroid a ratio → scale-invariant), so only flux saturated (z ≈ +38); and `analyzeMIR` sets `TrackProfile.mood` (30 % of the preset scorer), so **offline** preset selection ran on 9 effective features while the live mood was always correct. **Fix:** align the offline formula to live — `vDSP_zvabs` + `×2/fftSize` — in `SessionPreparer+Analysis.swift` and its `CorpusCensusRunner` census mirror. No retrain, no labels: the model was correct, only the offline extraction was wrong. **Validated:** flux z **+38 → +1.43**; the correction is a uniform 16× (σ=0 across tracks) so it generalizes corpus-wide without a re-run; 103 mood/MIR/session-prep/spectral tests green including `MoodClassifierGolden` (classifier untouched — this is a feature-extraction fix); blast radius measured benign (`mir_bpm` 0/40 changed, `key` 6/40 empty→resolved only, centroid invariant). **Code-complete, not resolved:** BUG-066 stays open pending Matt's live M7 (before/after preset picks on known tracks) — mood is taste-bearing, so green tests are necessary but not sufficient. Follow-up (MOOD-FLUX.3): route offline `analyzeMIR` through `FFTProcessor` directly so the two paths can't drift again.

### [dev-2026-07-08-141558] MOOD-FLUX.1 — flux-feature mismatch diagnosed (BUG-066)

Diagnosed the CENSUS.3 headline finding: the MoodClassifier's spectral-flux input runs **~32× the scale `mood_scaler.json` was fit on** (deploy mean 8.06 vs 0.25, z ≈ +38) → that channel is saturated on every track, and mood is 30 % of the preset scorer, so preset selection has quietly been running on 9 effective features. Root cause (traced through both feature extractors): the DEAM training extractor (`tools/train_mood_classifier.py`) and the runtime mood path (`SessionPreparer.analyzeMIR`, mirrored by the census) compute spectral flux with **different STFT parameters** — hop 512 overlapping vs **1024 non-overlapping**, magnitude norm `×2/fftSize` vs **`/√fftSize` (16× larger)**, 48 kHz vs native. Flux is the only exposed feature because it is fed **raw** into the classifier's z-score ([MIRPipeline.swift:66](../../PhospheneEngine/Sources/DSP/MIRPipeline.swift)), while band energies are AGC-normalized and centroid is a ratio — which is exactly why band/centroid match the scaler within ~20 % and only flux is off. Filed **BUG-066** (P2, ml.mood/calibration) with full expected/actual/repro/artifacts/failure-class/verification-criteria in `docs/diagnostics/BUG-066-diagnosis.md`; instrument→diagnose only, no production change. Fix scoped as **MOOD-FLUX.2** (recommended: regenerate the mood model against the runtime feature contract on the in-domain corpus, §5 Tier-2 — a retrain is required regardless, so scaler-only re-fits are rejected), gated on Matt's go and requiring a manual before/after preset-pick review (mood is taste-bearing).

### [dev-2026-07-07-231500] CENSUS.3 — pilot census run + distribution report

Ran the 1,000-track stratified pilot through `CorpusCensusRunner` (`--dual-rate`, 30 s window) — **993 analysed cleanly, 7 AVFoundation-unreadable** (old MP3 rips; graceful error rows + continue), full dual-rate pairing (993×2). New `tools/census_report.py` (reusable stdlib generator that joins the results CSV to the pilot manifest for genre/stratum) emits `docs/diagnostics/CENSUS_PILOT_REPORT.md`: folded-disagreement histogram vs the D-154 10 % gate, mood-feature means/stds vs `mood_scaler.json`, K-S key-confidence distribution, per-genre 3-way BPM census, dual-rate feature deltas. Headline measurements (each a candidate for its own D-numbered increment — the census measures, it does not retune): the mood scaler's **flux input is ~+38 DEAM-σ off** (saturated on every track, §5 Tier-1 candidate); **D-154's 10 % gate is a smooth continuum, not a valley, at scale** (32 % of the library reads irregular); **K-S key is 35 % F#-minor-biased**; **classical 47 % / jazz 42 % beat-irregular** (the rubato/swing blind spot, resourced for CENSUS.4); and the **cross-path centroid skew measures ~9 %, not the ~22 % in DECISIONS**. Report notes single-shot valence/arousal is EMA-attenuated (feature means are the calibration signal). Results stay on the corpus volume; only the summarized report is in-repo. Next: surface the retune candidates to Matt as product options; CENSUS.4 (full-corpus run + swing exploration) is gated on that review.
### [dev-2026-07-07-213134] CLEAN.5.9 — CI fast gate un-red (D-079 sample-rate lint)

The fast gate had been red on every `main` push since 2026-06-29, always at the final step: `Scripts/check_sample_rate_literals.sh` (D-079). Three violations had accumulated across increments that landed via worktree merges without the lint running pre-merge — the D-079 lint runs only in CI; `closeout_evidence.sh` does not include it (follow-up candidate: add it there). Fixes: `SessionPreparer.warmUpModels` (PREPPERF.2) now derives its silent warm-up buffer from `StemSeparator.modelSampleRate` instead of a hardcoded `44_100` (the D-079-prescribed fix — the intent is the model's native rate); `InstrumentFamilyDumper/Dumper.swift` (IFC) and `CorpusCensusRunner/CorpusCensusRunner.swift` (CENSUS.2) added to the script's allowlist — both are offline diagnostic CLIs off the live-tap path, and the census's dual-rate 44100/48000 rows are the feature. Verified locally: lint green, engine build green, the CI logic-test subset (131 tests) + DocIntegrityTests + `check_user_strings.sh` green.

### [dev-2026-07-07-201922] CENSUS.1–.2 — corpus batch-analysis harness

Phase CENSUS opens (from `docs/research/CORPUS_ML_OPPORTUNITIES.md §10 item 1`, Matt's go-ahead). **CENSUS.1** landed the corpus tooling: `tools/corpus_manifest.py` (scan/tag/pilot; mutagen; resumable) + the deterministic seed-42 stratified `tools/data/corpus_pilot_1000.csv` (jazz/classical/long-form/non-44.1 kHz/FLAC strata + proportional fill) over the 27,639-track archive, plus an ~800 KB gz repo copy of the full manifest. **CENSUS.2** added the `CorpusCensusRunner` executable target (retained-diagnostic; deps DSP/ML/Session): it drives the **existing** pipeline over the manifest and emits one CSV row per track — full-mix + drums-stem Beat This! grids, the continuous octave-folded BPM disagreement (D-154's evidence, not just its boolean), the MoodClassifier's 10 input-feature means + valence/arousal, K-S key + correlations, and the MIR tempo estimate. Resumable (skips already-written relpaths), `--dual-rate` emits 44.1/48 kHz MIR rows for the cross-path mood-skew calibration. The only production change is the **behaviour-identical** `foldedBPMDisagreement` extraction in `BPMMismatchCheck.swift`, now shared by the D-154 gate and the census (existing tests green; a new unit test pins the fold values incl. the just-under-2.0 edge). Fixed a real CRLF-parsing bug found on the pilot manifest (Swift treats `\r\n` as one grapheme cluster, so `split(separator: "\n")` silently made the whole file one line — now splits on `isNewline`). The census MEASURES only; every retune is a separate D-numbered increment. Dev-local validation: 12 real files (4 flac / 4 mp3 / 4 m4a, 44.1 + 48 kHz), sane BPMs, no empty feature columns, per-track <5 s, kill-and-resume lossless (zero duplicates). Next: CENSUS.3 (1,000-track pilot run + distribution report on the Mac mini).
