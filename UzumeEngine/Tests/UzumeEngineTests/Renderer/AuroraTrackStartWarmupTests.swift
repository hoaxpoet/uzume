// AuroraTrackStartWarmupTests — BUG-041: the FFO aurora must not flash at
// track starts.
//
// The per-stem deviation EMA re-seeds when `StemAnalyzer` resets per track and
// overswings for ~10 s; the aurora's drums driver (D-127 smoother) passed those
// swings to the GPU as visible intensity flashes. Fixtures are the REAL
// `drumsEnergyDev` series (FA #27) from session `2026-06-10T14-55-32Z` for the
// three tracks Matt flagged as flashing (So What, There, There, Lotus Flower).
// The test replays them through the EXACT production arithmetic
// (`RenderPipeline.auroraDriverStep`) and asserts the BUG-041 verification
// criterion: early-window output peak ≤ 1.5 × steady-state peak — with a
// red-arm sanity check that the same data violates it WITHOUT the warmup.
