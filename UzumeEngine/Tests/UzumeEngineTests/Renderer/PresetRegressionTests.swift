    // CR.2 rebuild (D-199): Cymatic Resonance is now a `feedback+particles` preset;
    // like Filigree/Mitosis its `pipelineState` is a black ground fragment (the sand
    // is a particle sim drawn on top), so — same as those particle presets — it has
    // NO golden entry here and skips this dHash gate. Its look/motion is gated by
    // CymaticSandSketchRenderTests instead.
    // V.7.7B Arachne: staged COMPOSITE fragment now ports the V.7.5 v5 web
    // walk + spider + mist + dust motes. The regression renders the COMPOSITE
    // stage in isolation with `worldTex` unbound (texture sampler returns 0),
    // so the hash captures the foreground composition alone — silk strands,
    // adhesive droplets, mist + motes — over a black backdrop. The full
    // WORLD + COMPOSITE composite is exercised by PresetVisualReviewTests.
    //
    // V.7.7C (D-093): drop overlay rewritten to §5.8 Snell's-law refractive
    // recipe. Under this regression path `worldTex` is unbound → bgSeen reads
    // black; drops compose as thin warm fresnel rim + warm specular pinpoint
    // + dark edge ring × audio gain. dHash UNCHANGED at the V.7.7B values:
    // the new contributions sum below the 9×8 luma quantization threshold of
    // dHash, so the foreground silhouette fingerprint is bytewise identical.
    // Real visual divergence is observed in PresetVisualReviewTests.
    //
    // V.7.7D (D-094): 3D SDF spider replaces the 2D overlay (spider not drawn
    // under regression — `spider.blend = 0` when buffer is unbound), and a
    // §8.2 12 Hz UV-jitter vibration is applied to the foreground web walks.
    // Vibration amplitude is gated by `bass_dev` + `beat_bass` so the silence
    // and quiet fixtures (zero/low values) produce no visible shake — those
    // hashes stay byte-identical. The beatHeavy fixture (`beat_bass` ≈ 1.0)
    // produces a small UV jitter that drifts the silk pattern by a few bits;
    // hash updated to match. Real visual divergence — including the new 3D
    // spider — is observed in PresetVisualReviewTests / ArachneSpiderRenderTests.
    //
    // V.7.7C.2 (D-095): Commit 3 swaps the foreground anchor's data source
    // from hardcoded (stage=3, progress=1) to webs[0] Row 5 BuildState. At
    // the harness's 0.5 s warmup the foreground hero is in frame phase at
    // frameProgress ≈ 0.166 (only the partial bridge thread renders), so the
    // V.7.7D upper-left fully-built foreground web disappears from the
    // regression composition. webs[1] (the second seedInitialWebs() stable
    // web) continues to render at lower-right unchanged, providing background
    // depth context. All three fixtures converge to the same hash because
    // the harness warmup uses one shared warmFV regardless of fixture — the
    // per-fixture pace differences surface only on real-music playback
    // (Matt's manual smoke gate). Hamming distance from V.7.7D `steady`:
    // 16 bits, within the D-095 expected [10, 30] band.
    //
    // V.7.7C.3 (D-095 follow-up): hash UNCHANGED. PresetRegression's render
    // harness does not bind slot 6 / 7 (sees zeroed buffers), so:
    //   - webs[0].rng_seed = 0 → polyCount = 0 → V.7.5 fallback (circular
    //     spoke tips, regular oval) instead of the new polygon path.
    //   - Pool loop iterates `wi=1..1` (empty) so the V.7.5 churn that
    //     V.7.7C.3 retired never appeared in this regression anyway.
    //   - webs[0].build_stage = 0 → foreground frame phase at 0 % progress,
    //     no visible foreground content.
    // Net: only the WORLD backdrop renders, identical to V.7.7C.2's
    // composition. The V.7.7C.3 polygon-mode visual change IS exercised by
    // ArachneSpiderRenderTests (which binds a real, reset()-seeded
    // ArachneState) and by PresetVisualReviewTests' RENDER_VISUAL=1 path.
    //
    // V.7.7C.5 (D-100): Arachne hashes UNCHANGED again. The §4 atmospheric
    // reframe retires the WORLD-side six-layer forest and replaces it with
    // the §4.2 sky band + volumetric atmosphere, AND the WEB pillar's
    // foreground hero web is now canvas-filling (`webR = 0.55`, hub at
    // (0.5, 0.5), polygon vertices off-frame). PresetRegression still
    // doesn't bind slot 6/7, so:
    //   - The COMPOSITE fragment samples `worldTex` for its backdrop, but
    //     the regression harness leaves `worldTex` unbound → bgColor = 0.
    //     The §4 WORLD reframe therefore produces no visible change in the
    //     regression-mode composition (which only sees COMPOSITE alone).
    //   - Foreground hero web at (0.5, 0.5) / `webR = 0.55` would now span
    //     most of the canvas — but the harness's zeroed slot-6 buffer gives
    //     `build_stage = 0, frame_progress = 0` → frame phase at 0 % →
    //     nothing rendered, so the canvas-filling change also doesn't
    //     surface here.
    //   - Spider hash DOES drift (`ArachneSpiderRenderTests` binds a
    //     `state.reset()`-seeded `ArachneState`, so the off-frame
    //     `kBranchAnchors[6]` move into the polygon decode path). Hamming
    //     distance V.7.7C.4 → V.7.7C.5: 7 bits (`0x06129A55C258494D` →
    //     `0x06D29A65E458494D`).
    // Real visual divergence — sky band + light shafts + canvas-filling
    // web — is observed in `PresetVisualReviewTests` (per-stage harness
    // with worldTex bound + reset()-seeded `ArachneState`).
    //
    // V.7.7C.4 (D-095 follow-up): hashes drift. Three fixes contribute:
    //   - Silk palette enrichment (silkTint 0.60 → 0.85; mood-driven hue;
    //     vocal-pitch coupling; ambient tint 0.25 → 0.40). Affects the
    //     foreground anchor block's silk emission stage — visible whenever
    //     `wr.strandCov > 0.001`.
    //   - Hub knot brightness 0.80 → 1.20 (saturated). Visible from
    //     `stage >= 1u`.
    //   - Per-beat global emission pulse `beatPulse * 0.45`. Adds
    //     `beat_bass`/`beat_composite` energy to silk brightness when a
    //     beat is firing.
    // PresetRegression still doesn't bind slot 6/7, so foreground at
    // frame-phase 0% has no silk content. The hash drift here comes from
    // the §8.2 vibration UV jitter applied at the top of
    // arachne_composite_fragment — which uses `bass_att_rel`. The
    // V.7.7C.4 changes don't move this term, but the cumulative shifts
    // through the V.7.7C.3 polygon mode + V.7.7C.4 emission stage produce
    // a slightly different per-pixel composition under noise alignment.
    // beatHeavy fixture (`beat_bass = 1.0`, `bassDev = 0.60`) diverges
    // from steady/quiet (zero bass deviation → no vibration). All three
    // fixtures within the [10, 30] hamming band documented for D-095.
    //
    // V.7.7C.5.1 (D-100 follow-up): hashes drift hard. The combined effect
    // of (a) silk line widths halved (spoke/frame 0.0024 → 0.0010, spiral
    // 0.0013 → 0.0007), (b) silk luminescence dimmed (silkTint 0.85 → 0.55,
    // hub knot 1.20 → 0.70, ambient tint 0.40 → 0.20, axial coefficient
    // 0.6 → 0.3, halo magnitudes ~halved), (c) per-segment macro variation
    // (`ancSeed = arachHashU32(webs[0].rng_seed ^ 0xCA51u)` instead of
    // hardcoded 1984u), (d) §4.3 palette pumped (sat 0.55–0.95 / val
    // 0.30–0.70 / hue cycle on accumulated_audio_time), and (e) shaft
    // engagement reformulated to floor+scale collapses the frame-phase-0
    // foreground hash to near-zero (the harness's zeroed slot 6 makes
    // foreground render minimally; thinner+dimmer lines push contribution
    // below dHash quantization). Real visual divergence is observed in
