// Suite A (8 unit tests): synthetic probs → algorithm contracts.
// Suite B (24 golden tests): 6 Beat This! reference fixtures × 4 assertions each.
//   Assertions: ≥95% beats within ±20ms, ≥90% downbeats within ±40ms,
//   BPM within ±0.5 of reference, beatsPerBar matches reference.
//
// Fixtures in Fixtures/beat_this_reference/ — committed to repo, always present.
