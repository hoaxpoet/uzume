// StemSeriesWiringTests — LFSTEM.1c/1e wiring gate.
//
// The series' arithmetic is tested in the engine suite (`StemFeatureSeriesTests`, alignment) and
// its persistence in `PersistentStemCacheTests`. What cannot be tested there is the WIRING: the
// engine needs Metal, a session and a decoded file to reach `publishStemSeriesFrame`, so the
// invariants below are asserted against the source shape — the same discriminator
// `TrackChangePresetResetRegressionTests` uses for the BUG-044 complementary-path rule.
//
// Three invariants, each with a specific failure it exists to catch:
//
//   1. Exactly one writer per frame. If the live path kept publishing StemFeatures while the
//      series did too, the last writer per frame would win — a race dressed as a feature.
//   2. The per-track surface is cleared on EVERY track change, not just the one that installs
//      it. That is the BUG-024 shape, where a publisher written on the LF path and never
//      cleared on the streaming path leaked one session's album art into every later track.
//   3. Streaming never gets a series. It cannot have one — a tap has no future to analyse — and
//      `analyzePreview` is shared, so the sweep must stay on the local-file path.
