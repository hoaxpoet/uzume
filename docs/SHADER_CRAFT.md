# Uzume — Shader Craft Handbook

**Status:** Draft v0.1. Canonical authoring guide for Uzume preset shaders. Primary audience: Claude Code sessions authoring new presets or uplifting existing ones. Secondary audience: Matt reviewing the output.

**Scope:** Fidelity. Specifically: how to write Metal shaders that look like they were made in 2026, not 2006. Covers detail cascades, material recipes, lighting recipes, volume and SDF craft, texturing beyond single-octave noise, performance guidance, and a per-preset uplift playbook.

**Out of scope:** Audio routing (that's `CLAUDE.md §Audio Data Hierarchy`), GPU binding contract (that's `CLAUDE.md §GPU Contract Details`), SwiftLint compliance (shader file-length rules are special-cased per §11).

---

## 1. Philosophy

### 1.1 The fidelity problem

Uzume's engine is modern: Metal 3.1+, deferred G-buffer ray march, IBL, SSGI, MetalFX-upscaling-capable, mesh shaders on M3+, hardware ray tracing via BVH. The engine can render AAA-quality output.

The preset shaders authored so far do not. Six iterations of Volumetric Lithograph, three of Arachne, three of Gossamer. Each iteration fixed a specific bug but none reached the quality bar of a modern ShaderToy top-hit, let alone a shipping game.

The root cause is not hardware, not Metal, not budget. The root cause is **authoring-vocabulary poverty**: the techniques that separate 2026-quality shaders from 2006-quality ones were not documented anywhere Claude Code could read them, and the `ShaderUtilities` library was thin.

This handbook addresses that directly.

### 1.2 The detail cascade principle

Every visible surface in a production-quality shader has **at least four distinct detail scales** layered together. Not one noise function, not two octaves of fBM — four or more distinct authoring layers, each targeted at a different spatial frequency.

Canonical cascade:

1. **Macro form** (unit scale — the whole thing). The SDF geometry or mesh silhouette. What you see from across the room.
2. **Meso variation** (∼0.1–0.3 unit scale). Dents, ridges, strata, folds. The "shape language" beyond primitive.
3. **Micro surface** (∼0.01–0.03 unit scale). Normal-map-level detail. The "texture" in the tactile sense.
4. **Specular breakup** (pixel to sub-pixel scale). Glints, roughness variation, micro-scratches. What makes metals look real.

A preset that skips any of these four reads as primitive, regardless of how clever the macro form is. The Arachne v3 web is a textbook example: beautiful macro form (concentric silk with spiral), no meso (every thread identical), no micro (thread surfaces are constant-albedo tubes), no specular breakup (uniform glow). Reads as clipart.

**Hard rule:** every preset ships with all four cascade layers applied to every primary surface.

### 1.3 The "2026 test"

Before declaring a preset done, ask: does a still frame from this preset look comparable to a still frame from a 2026-released indie game? If the answer is no, you are not done — regardless of how well it animates, how good the audio reactivity is, or how many hours have been spent iterating.

This is the quality bar. Not "better than Milkdrop 1999" (a low bar). Not "good given the constraints" (there are fewer constraints than it feels like). The bar is: comparable to a 2026-released game.

---

## 2. Authoring Workflow

### 2.0 Concept-viability gate

Before authoring discipline (§2.1–§2.4) is worth running, the preset *concept* has to clear three gates. Skipping this section is the failure mode that produced the Drift Motes retirement (D-102 / Failed Approach #58, 2026-05-11): five remediation increments shipped tuning changes on a preset whose concept did not have a viable musical role, and none of them converged.

**Gate 1 — One-sentence musical role.** Write the answer to: *"How is this preset's primary visual subject another instrument in the band?"* The sentence must name (a) a specific musical feature — a beat, a downbeat, a sustained bass envelope, a vocal pitch contour, a structural boundary, a build-up — and (b) a specific visual behaviour the listener will pair with it. Examples that pass:

- *Murmuration:* "The flock's coherence collapses on drum onsets and reforms on the next downbeat — the listener sees the kick as a momentary scatter and the bar boundary as the reformation."
- *Arachne:* "The web's build progression (frame → radials → spiral) is the structural arc of the segment, with the spider's appearance triggered by sustained sub-bass — the listener pairs the sub-bass drop with the spider revealing itself."
- *Lumen Mosaic (LM.3.2):* "Each Voronoi cell is assigned to one FFT band team; its palette advances discretely on rising-edge of its team's beat — the listener sees the music as a coordinated ensemble of cells dancing on the bands they belong to."

Examples that fail:

- "Drifting particles in a god-ray light shaft reactive to mid-band energy." (Drift Motes DM.0 — no specific musical feature, no specific behaviour the listener can pair.)
- "Vibe with the music." / "Feels like the song." / "Reactive to energy." (These are absent answers wearing a costume.)

If you cannot write the sentence cleanly, *stop and bring the gap to Matt before scoping the increment*. Do not start DM.0 / LM.0 / X.0 on a concept whose musical role you cannot articulate. The cost of pausing to align is small; the cost of four days of iteration that does not converge is what produced D-102.

**Gate 2 — Iconic visual subject deliverable at fidelity.** From a comparable past preset, demonstrate that the visual style is reachable. Honest self-assessment: if Matt has flagged a fidelity gap on a similar preset before, default to "I cannot deliver this" until proven otherwise. *"B or C will be botched by you because you won't be able to achieve the level of visual fidelity needed. I have literally watched this happen for the last several preset designs"* (Matt 2026-05-11) is a binding constraint, not a debate prompt.

**Gate 3 — Infrastructure-feasible.** Does not require render passes / engine surfaces / GPU contracts Uzume lacks. If the answer is "we can add the infrastructure," check whether Matt agrees the infrastructure-adding increment is worth doing as a precondition.

Pitches that pass two of three gates and require Matt to spot the missing third are not acceptable. Surface concerns *before* the pitch, not when cornered. The pattern of pitching a concept whose problems you can see but haven't surfaced is what produced *"This is exactly what I'm fearing... If you have concerns, I will most likely have greater concerns"* (2026-05-11).

### 2.1 Never author blind

Before a single line of MSL is written:

1. Read `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset_name>/README.md`.
2. Study the reference images curated there. The typical preset has 3–5 references; composite presets may require more, with each image earning its place by isolating a distinct trait (per D-065). Each reference has annotations specifying which visual traits are mandatory, which are decorative, and which traits of the image must be *actively disregarded* by Claude Code sessions reading the folder (e.g. the radial vein pattern in a lotus-leaf droplet reference is not a directive about spike arrangement).
3. Write down the four detail-cascade layers you intend to implement. Sketch each as a one-line description referencing specific utility functions from `Shaders/Utilities/`.

Claude Code sessions that skip step 1–2 produce primitive output. Observed on every iteration v1 → v3 of every preset before Phase V. This is `Failed Approach §35` in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 2.2 Coarse-to-fine construction

Never write a finished-looking shader in one pass. The order that consistently produces quality output:

1. **Macro geometry pass.** SDF scene or mesh silhouette. Bounding box, readable composition, one material per region. No detail. Should look like clay maquette. Test in `TestSphere`-style pipeline before going further.
2. **Material pass.** Apply cookbook material recipes from §4 to each region. Still one instance per material — no variation yet.
3. **Meso variation pass.** Add per-primitive variation (tilt, scale, color shift, SDF displacement) so no two instances are identical.
4. **Micro detail pass.** Add detail normals, triplanar texturing, POM where budget allows.
5. **Specular breakup pass.** Roughness variation, grunge, thin-film interference, specular glints.
6. **Atmosphere pass.** Fog, god rays, dust motes, aerial perspective.
7. **Lighting polish.** IBL balance, fill lighting, rim light tuning.
8. **Audio reactivity pass.** Route `FeatureVector` and `StemFeatures` into parameters. Use deviation primitives per `CLAUDE.md §Audio Data Hierarchy` (D-026). Per-frame breathing via `mv_warp` if appropriate (D-027, D-029 constraints apply).
9. **Matt review.** Frame capture compared against reference images. No approval → loop back to whichever pass is weakest.

Passes 1–7 are the fidelity work. Pass 8 is what every prior preset iteration *started* with. The order matters.

### 2.3 Reference-image discipline

Every new preset requires a VISUAL_REFERENCES folder before its first session prompt can be written. Matt owns the references. Photographic references must be sourced from real photography or in-engine capture — AI-generated images are not permitted *except* in the anti-reference slot (`05_anti_*`), under the narrow carve-out described below (per D-065). Claude Code sessions reference them by filename:

```
docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/arachne/
  README.md
  01_macro_web_geometry.jpg       (annotation: "silk threads ≈1.5 px at 1080p")
  02_meso_per_strand_variation.jpg (annotation: "no two strands identical in tension/sag")
  03_micro_adhesive_droplet.jpg    (annotation: "drops 8–12 px apart on spiral threads")
  04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg  (annotation: "narrow axial specular along each strand")
  05_anti_reference.jpg            (annotation: "NOT this — flat cylindrical tubes")
```

Session prompts reference images directly: "Implement strand specular per `04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg`, specifically the narrow axial highlight running along each fiber."

**Anti-reference AI-generation carve-out (per D-065).** The anti-reference slot (`05_anti_*`) may use an AI-generated image when (a) the failure mode being depicted is non-photographable (e.g. "ferrofluid that has lost its Rosensweig spike topology and become a chrome blob" — a phenomenon that does not occur in nature), and (b) sourcing a real-photograph or in-engine v1-baseline alternative is impractical. AI-generated anti-references must:
- Use the `_AIGEN` suffix in the filename (e.g. `05_anti_chrome_blob_AIGEN.jpg`) so the AI provenance is visible in any session prompt that cites the file.
- Carry an annotation stating that *every* trait of the image is anti — there is no partial-trust read of any visual property.
- Be flagged in the README's Provenance section with a planned replacement, typically a v1-baseline frame capture once the preset's first iteration ships.

The carve-out does not extend to any other slot. Real photography or controlled in-engine capture remains mandatory for `01_macro_*` through `04_specular_*`, `06_palette_*`, `07_atmosphere_*`, `08_lighting_*`, and `09_*`.

The lint check at `UzumeTools/Sources/CheckVisualReferences` (Increment V.5)
verifies that every registered preset has a populated VISUAL_REFERENCES folder and
that filenames follow `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/_NAMING_CONVENTION.md`. Run via:

```bash
swift run --package-path UzumeTools CheckVisualReferences
```

Session prompts SHOULD cite specific reference filenames inline
(e.g. "implement strand specular per `04_specular_fiber_highlight.jpg`").
Reviewers SHOULD reject session prompts for V.7+ that do not cite at least one
reference filename for each major implementation pass.

### 2.4 The rubric

Every preset is gated against a fidelity rubric before certification (§12). Passing compilation and passing `Increment 5.2` invariants are necessary but not sufficient.

---

## 3. Noise Layering

### 3.1 Why single-octave is primitive

A single Perlin or Worley call produces one spatial frequency. Real surfaces have variation across many frequencies simultaneously — you see the macro shape, the meso ripples, the micro grain, all at once. A single-octave noise-textured surface reads as "procedural" in the bad sense: machine-generated rather than physically-derived.

### 3.2 8-octave hero fBM

The workhorse. Eight octaves, per-octave amplitude halving, per-octave frequency doubling, with a rotation between octaves to avoid grid artifacts.

```metal
// From Shaders/Utilities/Noise/FBM.metal (Increment V.1)
float fbm8(float3 p, float H = 0.5) {
    const float3x3 rot = float3x3(
        0.00, 0.80, 0.60,
       -0.80, 0.36,-0.48,
       -0.60,-0.48, 0.64
    );
    float a = 1.0;
    float f = 1.0;
    float sum = 0.0;
    float norm = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        sum += a * perlin3d(p * f);
        norm += a;
        a *= H;
        f *= 2.0;
        p = rot * p;
    }
    return sum / norm;
}
```

Use for: terrain heightfields, organic surface displacement, cloud density fields.

Cost: ~8× single-octave Perlin. At 1080p budget ~2 ms per screen-space fbm8 call on Tier 2. Avoid inside an inner ray-march loop; compute once per ray hit.

### 3.3 Ridged multifractal for mountainous topology

`fbm8` produces lumpy, rolling shapes — good for hills, bad for mountains. Mountains need ridged noise: sharp crests, valleys, drainage networks.

```metal
// Shaders/Utilities/Noise/RidgedMultifractal.metal (Increment V.1)
float ridged_mf(float3 p, float H = 0.5) {
    float a = 1.0;
    float f = 1.0;
    float sum = 0.0;
    float norm = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
        float n = perlin3d(p * f);
        n = 1.0 - abs(n);       // ridges
        n *= n;                  // sharpen
        sum += a * n;
        norm += a;
        a *= H;
        f *= 2.0;
    }
    return sum / norm;
}
```

Use for: Volumetric Lithograph terrain, Arachne background topology, anywhere you want crests and valleys.

### 3.4 Domain warping

The single highest-leverage noise technique. Warp the input coordinates through another noise field before evaluating the base noise. Produces organic, swirling, liquid forms that straight fBM cannot.

```metal
// Shaders/Utilities/Noise/DomainWarp.metal (Increment V.1)
float warped_fbm(float3 p) {
    float3 q = float3(fbm8(p + float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)),
                      fbm8(p + float3(5.2, 1.3, 7.1)),
                      fbm8(p + float3(3.1, 9.7, 2.9)));
    float3 r = float3(fbm8(p + 4.0 * q + float3(1.7, 9.2, 3.4)),
                      fbm8(p + 4.0 * q + float3(8.3, 2.8, 1.1)),
                      fbm8(p + 4.0 * q + float3(4.5, 6.1, 2.3)));
    return fbm8(p + 4.0 * r);
}
```

Use for: any surface that needs to look alive — Ferrofluid Ocean waves, Gossamer silk flow, lichen patches on Fractal Tree bark, Volumetric Lithograph erosion.

Cost: 7 fbm8 calls = 56 Perlin evaluations. Heavy. Compute per-vertex or per-hit, not per-pixel.

### 3.5 Curl noise for fluid flow fields

Curl of a vector-valued noise field is divergence-free: perfect for fluid-like flow without net inflow/outflow. Drives particle velocities, heightfield advection, flow-map UV offsets.

```metal
// Shaders/Utilities/Noise/Curl.metal (Increment V.1)
// Divergence-free 3D curl via central differences on fbm8.
// For curl of (Fx, Fy, Fz):  curl.x = dFz/dy - dFy/dz, etc.
static inline float3 curl_noise(float3 p, float e = 0.01) {
    float inv2e = 0.5 / e;

    float n1 = fbm8(p + float3(0, e, 0)) - fbm8(p - float3(0, e, 0));  // dFz/dy
    float n2 = fbm8(p + float3(0, 0, e)) - fbm8(p - float3(0, 0, e));  // dFy/dz
    float n3 = fbm8(p + float3(e, 0, 0)) - fbm8(p - float3(e, 0, 0));  // dFx/dz
    float n4 = fbm8(p + float3(0, 0, e)) - fbm8(p - float3(0, 0, e));  // dFz/dx
    float n5 = fbm8(p + float3(e, 0, 0)) - fbm8(p - float3(e, 0, 0));  // dFy/dx
    float n6 = fbm8(p + float3(0, e, 0)) - fbm8(p - float3(0, e, 0));  // dFx/dy

    return float3(
        (n1 - n2) * inv2e,   // curl.x = dFz/dy - dFy/dz
        (n3 - n4) * inv2e,   // curl.y = dFx/dz - dFz/dx
        (n5 - n6) * inv2e    // curl.z = dFy/dx - dFx/dy
    );
}
```

Use for: particle flow in Murmuration successors, water advection in Ferrofluid Ocean, smoke/mist advection, Arachne dust-mote drift.

### 3.6 Worley-Perlin blend

Worley (cellular) noise produces distinct features — cells, cracks, spots. Blending Worley into fBM gives "fBM with character" — streaked, veined, marbled.

```metal
// Shaders/Utilities/Noise/Worley.metal (Increment V.1)
static inline float worley_fbm(float3 p) {
    float w = worley3d(p * 2.0).x;   // F1 distance
    float f = fbm8(p);
    return mix(f, w, 0.35);
}
```

Use for: granite/marble/stone, cell-like organic tissue (Arachne carapace), drainage patterns in erosion.

### 3.7 Blue-noise dithering

Per `CLAUDE.md §Texture Binding Layout` texture(8) is 256² IGN (Interleaved Gradient Noise) blue noise. Use it to kill banding in every integration pass:

```metal
// In any integrating pass (SSGI, volumetric, probe sampling)
float dither = blue_noise_tex.sample(sampler, in.uv * screen_size / 256.0).r;
float jittered_t = ray_t + dither * step_size;
```

Blue-noise dithering turns perceptible banding into perceptually-invisible noise. Every volumetric and SSGI pass should use it.

### 3.8 Recipe cheat sheet

| Visual target | Recipe |
|---|---|
| Rolling hills | `fbm8(p * 0.15)` |
| Sharp mountains | `ridged_mf(p * 0.15)` |
| Liquid flow | `warped_fbm(p)` |
| Cells / drainage | `worley_fbm(p * 0.8)` |
| Clouds | `fbm8(p + time * 0.1)`, density-remapped |
| Swirling smoke | `fbm8(p + 2.0 * curl_noise(p + t))` |
| Stone / granite | `worley_fbm(p * 2.0) + 0.2 * fbm8(p * 8.0)` |
| Erosion striations | `ridged_mf(warped_fbm_vec(p))` |

---

## 4. Material Cookbook

Each recipe assumes the preset fragment has access to `FeatureVector& f [[buffer(0)]]`, `StemFeatures& stems [[buffer(3)]]`, and writes to the standard G-buffer layout from `CLAUDE.md §G-Buffer Layout`. Cost estimates are at 1080p on M3 (Tier 2).

Materials are authored as functions returning `MaterialResult`:

```metal
struct MaterialResult {
    float3 albedo;
    float roughness;
    float metallic;
    float3 normal;       // in world space or tangent space per preset convention
    float3 emission;     // HDR (used by PBR composite)
};
```

### 4.1 Polished chrome

**Use for:** Kinetic Sculpture chrome lattice, mirror-bright highlights, Glass Brutalist chrome fixtures.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_polished_chrome(float3 wp, float3 n) {
    MaterialResult m;
    m.albedo = float3(0.95);
    m.roughness = 0.03;
    m.metallic = 1.0;
    // Anisotropic streak via tangent-aligned roughness modulation
    float streak = fbm8(wp * 40.0);
    m.roughness += 0.04 * streak;   // break up uniformity
    m.normal = n;
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.2 ms. Looks flat without nearby IBL variation — always needs a detailed surrounding.

### 4.2 Brushed aluminum

**Use for:** Kinetic Sculpture brushed lattice, aircraft skins, industrial fixtures.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_brushed_aluminum(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 brush_dir) {
    MaterialResult m;
    m.albedo = float3(0.91, 0.92, 0.93);
    // Brush streaks: anisotropic roughness along brush_dir
    float streak_coord = dot(wp, brush_dir);
    float streak = fract(streak_coord * 300.0);
    streak = abs(streak - 0.5);   // triangle wave
    m.roughness = 0.18 + 0.08 * streak;  // 0.10–0.26 striped
    m.metallic = 1.0;
    // Detail normal perturbation along brush direction
    float3 perp = normalize(cross(n, brush_dir));
    m.normal = normalize(n + perp * 0.02 * streak);
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.3 ms. The anisotropic streak is the difference between "brushed aluminum" and "flat matte metal."

### 4.3 Silk thread (Marschner-lite fiber BRDF)

**Use for:** Arachne + Gossamer spider silk, any fiber-rendered preset. This is the single biggest fidelity lift for both Arachnid Trilogy presets.

True Marschner is expensive (three lobes, elliptical cross-section). A practical approximation keeps the R (reflection) and TT (transmission-transmission) lobes and fakes TRT as a secondary rim.

**Recipe:**

```metal
struct FiberParams {
    float3 fiber_tangent;     // along the thread
    float3 fiber_normal;      // perpendicular, around which fiber is symmetric
    float azimuthal_r;        // cuticle roughness (longitudinal)
    float azimuthal_tt;       // internal scattering roughness
    float absorption;         // silk absorption along thread
    float3 tint;              // silk tint
};

MaterialResult mat_silk_thread(float3 wp, FiberParams p, float3 L, float3 V) {
    MaterialResult m;
    float3 T = p.fiber_tangent;

    // R lobe: specular cone around T with roughness azimuthal_r
    float cos_theta_i = dot(T, L);
    float cos_theta_o = dot(T, V);
    float theta_h = acos(clamp((cos_theta_i + cos_theta_o) * 0.5, -1.0, 1.0));
    float r_lobe = exp(-theta_h * theta_h / (2.0 * p.azimuthal_r * p.azimuthal_r));

    // TT lobe: transmission-transmission, approximated as back-lit rim
    float backlit = saturate(-dot(T, L) * dot(T, V));
    float tt_lobe = pow(backlit, 1.0 / max(0.01, p.azimuthal_tt));

    m.albedo = p.tint;
    m.roughness = 0.3;
    m.metallic = 0.0;
    m.normal = normalize(p.fiber_normal);
    m.emission = p.tint * (r_lobe * 1.5 + tt_lobe * 0.6);

    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.8 ms per hit. Node count makes this more expensive than chrome, but each silk strand is worth it.

**Why this matters for Arachne/Gossamer:** current implementations render silk as constant-albedo cylinders. With Marschner-lite, silk strands exhibit narrow axial specular highlights (the R lobe) and a warm rim on back-lit threads (the TT lobe). This is exactly what you see in a nature-documentary close-up of a real web.

### 4.4 Wet stone

**Use for:** Glass Brutalist concrete after rain, any darkened wet surface.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_wet_stone(float3 wp, float3 n, float wetness) {
    MaterialResult m;
    float3 dry_albedo = float3(0.35, 0.32, 0.30);
    float3 wet_albedo = dry_albedo * 0.55;      // wet darkens albedo
    m.albedo = mix(dry_albedo, wet_albedo, wetness);

    // Wet surface: smooth (low roughness) but still dielectric
    m.roughness = mix(0.85, 0.15, wetness);
    m.metallic = 0.0;

    // Detail normal from triplanar fBM for stone surface
    m.normal = triplanar_normal(wp * 3.0, n, 0.08);

    // Clear-coat highlight layer: add glossy specular on top of rough base
    // (handled in PBR composite by boosting specular contribution when wetness > 0.3)
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.6 ms. Triplanar is the key — uniplanar stretches on vertical surfaces look wrong.

### 4.5 Frosted glass

**Use for:** Glass Brutalist glass fins, any diffused-light transmitter.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_frosted_glass(float3 wp, float3 n) {
    MaterialResult m;
    // High albedo (near white) for diffuse scattering
    m.albedo = float3(0.85, 0.88, 0.90);
    // Moderate roughness — not quite matte, not quite clear
    m.roughness = 0.45;
    m.metallic = 0.0;

    // Frost variation: surface-scale noise perturbs normal
    float3 frost = float3(
        fbm8(wp * 25.0),
        fbm8(wp * 25.0 + float3(13.1, 0.0, 0.0)),
        fbm8(wp * 25.0 + float3(0.0, 17.3, 0.0))
    );
    m.normal = normalize(n + (frost - 0.5) * 0.15);

    // Faint internal scattering — emissive approximation for SSS
    float sss_factor = 0.15;
    m.emission = m.albedo * sss_factor;

    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.5 ms. Current Glass Brutalist glass is too clean — frost variation is what sells the diffusion.

Recipe is matched to sandblasted / acid-etched glass aesthetics. For pebbled
or hammered pattern glass — coherent cellular dimples rather than uniform
frost — use `mat_pattern_glass` (§4.5b) instead. Glass Brutalist v2 commits
to the pattern variant per V.12 scope; `mat_frosted_glass` remains canonical
for any preset wanting sandblasted diffusion.

### 4.5b Pattern glass (voronoi cellular)

**Use for:** Glass Brutalist glass fins (per V.12 scope); any architectural
pattern-glass / hammered-glass / pebbled-diffuser surface where the cellular
structure should read as coherent geometry rather than noise.

**Differs from `mat_frosted_glass`** in that diffusion comes from a Voronoi
cellular pattern (each cell a domed dimple separated by a sharp ridge) rather
than fbm-noise normal perturbation. Architecturally this matches pebbled and
hammered patterned glass; the fbm-frost variant matches sandblasted / acid-
etched glass. Pick per preset.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_pattern_glass(float3 wp, float3 n) {
    MaterialResult m;
    // Same base optics as mat_frosted_glass, with slightly lower roughness —
    // pattern glass tends to have crisper highlights between cells than frost.
    m.albedo    = float3(0.85, 0.88, 0.90);
    m.roughness = 0.40;
    m.metallic  = 0.0;

    // Sample voronoi_f1f2 at world-position and two ε-offsets so a height
    // gradient can be derived. scale 18 ≈ 3-5 cells per architectural unit
    // at typical viewing distance; tune per preset via uniform if needed.
    // For non-axis-aligned faces, project wp into the fin's face plane
    // before sampling (e.g. wp.yz for X-aligned vertical fins).
    const float scale = 18.0;
    const float eps   = 0.005;
    float2 p  =  wp.xy                       * scale;
    float2 px = (wp.xy + float2(eps, 0.0))   * scale;
    float2 py = (wp.xy + float2(0.0, eps))   * scale;

    VoronoiResult v0 = voronoi_f1f2(p,  4.0);   // Texture/Voronoi.metal
    VoronoiResult vx = voronoi_f1f2(px, 4.0);
    VoronoiResult vy = voronoi_f1f2(py, 4.0);

    // Domed cells: F1 small at cell centre, large at cell edge → invert for
    // height. The (F2 - F1) factor gates the dome down to zero at cell
    // boundaries, producing a sharp inter-cell ridge that catches highlights.
    float h0 = (1.0 - saturate(v0.f1 * scale)) * smoothstep(0.0, 0.04, v0.f2 - v0.f1);
    float hx = (1.0 - saturate(vx.f1 * scale)) * smoothstep(0.0, 0.04, vx.f2 - vx.f1);
    float hy = (1.0 - saturate(vy.f1 * scale)) * smoothstep(0.0, 0.04, vy.f2 - vy.f1);

    float3 height_grad = float3(h0 - hx, h0 - hy, 0.001) * (1.0 / eps);
    m.normal = normalize(n + height_grad * 0.04);

    // Faint internal scattering approximation — same as mat_frosted_glass.
    m.emission = m.albedo * 0.15;

    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.5–0.6 ms (three `voronoi_f1f2` calls at ~0.11 ms each plus arithmetic).
The cell-edge ridge — driven by the smoothstep on F2−F1 — is what sells this
as patterned rather than noisy; a flat dome without the ridge collapses back
toward fbm-frost in appearance.

### 4.6 Ferrofluid (Rosensweig spikes)

**Use for:** Ferrofluid Ocean. This preset's fidelity hinges on this recipe.

Ferrofluid surfaces under magnetic field form a lattice of conical spikes (Rosensweig instability). The spike array is not perfectly regular — it has hexagonal tendencies with domain defects. Between the spikes the surface is nearly mirror-metal.

Under the V.9 Ferrofluid Ocean redirect (D-124), the material is composed with a thin-film interference layer via `thinfilm_rgb` from `Utilities/PBR/Thin.metal` (tuned for cool tones — blue-to-cyan iridescent shift across viewing angle). The §4.6 recipe below provides the base albedo, roughness, metallic, and normal; the thin-film contribution is added in the lighting pass and modulates the specular phase across viewing angle. The "hint of blue in highlights" note in the recipe comment was the original placeholder for what thin-film now implements concretely. (For a reference call-site pattern, see §4.18 `mat_chitin` — V.9 uses the same `thinfilm_rgb` utility with a different parameter set.)

**Recipe for the SDF:**

```metal
// Field at position p: returns height displacement.
// Uses voronoi_f1f2 (Geometry/Voronoi-based) for authentic Rosensweig cell centres.
// `field_strength` ∈ [0,1]; route from stems.bass_energy_dev.
// `t` = FeatureVector.accumulated_audio_time.
static inline float ferrofluid_field(float3 p, float field_strength, float t) {
    float2 xz = p.xz;
    // Voronoi cell centres — gives proper Rosensweig hex-like distribution.
    VoronoiResult v = voronoi_f1f2(xz, 4.0);   // from Texture/Voronoi.metal
    // Per-cell jitter from fBM seeded by cell centre.
    float jitter = fbm8(float3(v.pos * 2.0, 0.0)) * 0.3;
    float d = v.f1 + jitter * 0.05;
    // Conical spike profile with bell-curve falloff.
    float spike = exp(-d * d * 40.0);
    // Time-animated per-cell phase: cell hash gives unique phase per spike.
    float cellPhase = float(v.id & 0xFFFF) * (6.283185 / float(0xFFFF));
    spike *= 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(t * 0.8 + cellPhase);
    return spike * field_strength * 0.15;
}

static inline float sdf_ferrofluid(float3 p, float field_strength, float t) {
    float base_y = 0.0;
    float spikes  = ferrofluid_field(p, field_strength, t);
    return p.y - (base_y + spikes);
}
```

**Recipe for the material:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_ferrofluid(float3 wp, float3 n) {
    MaterialResult m;
    // Deep black with hint of blue in highlights (magnetic fluid is oil-based, dark)
    m.albedo = float3(0.02, 0.03, 0.05);
    m.roughness = 0.08;   // near-mirror
    m.metallic = 1.0;     // F0 behaves metallic
    // Anisotropy along flow direction: if we have one
    m.normal = n;
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

Cost: spike field ~1.5 ms, material ~0.2 ms. The spike lattice is animation-heavy — route `field_strength` from `stems.bass_energy_dev` so bass pulses drive spike height.

### 4.7 Bark

**Use for:** Fractal Tree bark. Current FT presets render bare geometry.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_bark(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 fiber_up) {
    MaterialResult m;
    // Base color: warm brown with variation
    float3 base = float3(0.18, 0.11, 0.07);
    float3 lichen = float3(0.35, 0.42, 0.22);

    // Lichen patches via Worley
    float w = worley3d(wp * 0.6).x;
    float lichen_mask = smoothstep(0.25, 0.40, w);
    m.albedo = mix(base, lichen, lichen_mask * 0.4);

    // Vertical fiber displacement: ridges along fiber_up
    float fiber_coord = dot(wp, fiber_up);
    float ridges = abs(fract(fiber_coord * 8.0) - 0.5);
    ridges = smoothstep(0.1, 0.4, ridges);

    // Overall bark normal perturbation
    float3 horizontal = normalize(cross(fiber_up, n));
    m.normal = normalize(n + horizontal * ridges * 0.35);
    // Micro detail
    m.normal = triplanar_detail_normal(m.normal, wp * 30.0, 0.04);

    m.roughness = 0.85 + 0.1 * fbm8(wp * 5.0);
    m.metallic = 0.0;
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.9 ms. Ridges + lichen + triplanar detail is what separates "bark" from "brown cylinder."

### 4.8 Translucent leaf

**Use for:** Fractal Tree foliage. Requires SSS approximation.

**Recipe:**

```metal
MaterialResult mat_leaf(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 V, float3 L) {
    MaterialResult m;
    // Chlorophyll green with vein variation
    float3 base = float3(0.12, 0.25, 0.08);
    float3 vein = float3(0.20, 0.35, 0.12);
    float vein_mask = smoothstep(0.45, 0.55, fbm8(wp * 12.0));
    m.albedo = mix(base, vein, vein_mask);

    // Back-lit SSS: leaf glows warmly when light shines through
    float VdotL = dot(V, -L);
    float sss = saturate(VdotL);
    sss = pow(sss, 3.0);
    float3 sss_tint = float3(0.6, 0.8, 0.2);
    m.emission = sss_tint * sss * 0.8;

    m.roughness = 0.5;
    m.metallic = 0.0;
    m.normal = n;
    return m;
}
```

Cost: ~0.4 ms. The back-lit SSS term is what sells "leaf" vs "green plastic."

### 4.9 Volumetric cloud

**Use for:** Murmuration sky backdrop, Volumetric Lithograph aerial perspective, any atmospheric preset.

Clouds are not a surface material — they're volumetric. Rendered via ray-march through a density field with Henyey-Greenstein phase function.

```metal
float3 sample_cloud(float3 ro, float3 rd, float3 light_dir, float3 light_color) {
    float3 col = float3(0.0);
    float transmittance = 1.0;
    float t = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) {
        float3 p = ro + rd * t;
        float density = cloud_density_field(p);   // fbm8 + remap
        if (density > 0.01) {
            // Sample light through cloud to get self-shadow
            float light_march = 0.0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 6; ++j) {
                float3 lp = p + light_dir * (float(j) * 0.2);
                light_march += cloud_density_field(lp);
            }
            float shadow = exp(-light_march * 0.5);
            // Henyey-Greenstein phase (g = 0.2 for forward scattering)
            float cos_theta = dot(rd, light_dir);
            float phase = (1.0 - 0.04) / pow(1.0 + 0.04 - 0.4 * cos_theta, 1.5);
            col += transmittance * density * shadow * phase * light_color * 0.05;
            transmittance *= exp(-density * 0.1);
            if (transmittance < 0.01) break;
        }
        t += 0.15;
    }
    return col;
}
```

Cost: heavy — ~3 ms per full-screen cloud pass at 1080p on Tier 2. Sample half-res and upscale with MetalFX Temporal if frame budget tight.

### 4.10 Gold

`Materials/Metals.metal:mat_gold` — warm yellow metallic with fine scratch normal variation.

```metal
// Caller responsibilities: none.
// Exposure should be calibrated against the IBL ambient floor — gold blows out under a bright ambient term.

    MaterialResult m;
    m.albedo   = float3(1.0, 0.78, 0.34);
    m.roughness = 0.15;
    m.metallic  = 1.0;
    // Fine scratch fBM at 50× scale, amplitude 0.03 — breaks "liquid gold" uniformity.
    float3 scratch = float3(
        fbm8(wp * 50.0),
        fbm8(wp * 50.0 + float3(7.3, 0.0, 0.0)),
        fbm8(wp * 50.0 + float3(0.0, 3.7, 0.0))
    );
    m.normal   = normalize(n + (scratch - 0.5) * 0.03);
    m.emission = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

### 4.11 Copper with patina

`Materials/Metals.metal:mat_copper` — warm copper on exposed peaks, teal verdigris patina in crevices.

```metal
// ao ∈ [0, 1]: AO = 0 → occluded (more patina), AO = 1 → exposed (clean copper).
// If AO unavailable, pass 0.5 for a mid-blend.
MaterialResult mat_copper(float3 wp, float3 n, float ao) {
    MaterialResult m;
    float3 copper_albedo = float3(0.95, 0.60, 0.36);
    float3 patina_albedo = float3(0.15, 0.55, 0.45);

    // worley_fbm range ≈ [-0.65, 0.79]; threshold at 0.1–0.3 captures upper ~30%.
    float w = worley_fbm(wp * 2.0);
    float patina_mask = smoothstep(0.10, 0.30, w) * (1.0 - ao);

    m.albedo    = mix(copper_albedo, patina_albedo, patina_mask);
    m.roughness = mix(0.25, 0.70, patina_mask);
    m.metallic  = mix(1.0,  0.0,  patina_mask);
    m.normal    = n;
    m.emission  = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

`Materials/Organic.metal:mat_velvet` — Oren-Nayar diffuse with Fresnel-driven fuzz term (Increment V.4).

```metal
// velvet_color: fabric colour. NdotV ∈ [0,1]: view-incidence cosine.
// sigma = 0.35 (standard velvet roughness — produces visible retro-reflective lobe).
MaterialResult mat_velvet(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 velvet_color, float NdotV) {
    MaterialResult m;
    m.albedo    = velvet_color;
    m.roughness = 0.90;   // diffuse base is matte
    m.metallic  = 0.0;
    m.normal    = n;

    // Oren-Nayar at sigma=0.35 is approximated by the lambert base above.
    // Fuzz term: brightens at grazing angles (opposite of Fresnel).
    float fuzz = pow(1.0 - NdotV, 2.0);
    m.emission = velvet_color * fuzz * 0.5;
    return m;
}
```

### 4.13 Ceramic (clear-coat)

`Materials/Dielectrics.metal:mat_ceramic` — saturated diffuse glaze base; clear-coat in lighting stage.

```metal
// base_color: the saturated clay/glaze colour.
// Note: the true two-lobe clear-coat (roughness_coat=0.05, F0=0.04) must be added
// in the PBR lighting composite — MaterialResult's single roughness field models
// the diffuse scatter only.
MaterialResult mat_ceramic(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 base_color) {
    MaterialResult m;
    m.albedo    = base_color;
    m.roughness = 0.6 + fbm8(wp * 8.0) * 0.04;   // subtle surface variation
    m.roughness = clamp(m.roughness, 0.0, 1.0);
    m.metallic  = 0.0;
    m.normal    = n;
    m.emission  = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

### 4.14 Ocean water

`Materials/Exotic.metal:mat_ocean` — Fresnel-weighted specular, deep-water absorption, foam on crests.

```metal
// NdotV ∈ [0,1]: view-incidence cosine.
// depth ∈ [0,1]: depth below wave crest (0 = crest/foam, 1 = trough).
//   Callers compute from wave geometry (displacement derivatives).
// Gerstner-wave displacement and capillary ripples are SDF/geometry concerns
// at the preset level (§7). This function handles material properties only.
MaterialResult mat_ocean(float3 wp, float3 n, float NdotV, float depth) {
    MaterialResult m;
    float foam_mask    = smoothstep(0.10, 0.35, 1.0 - depth);
    float3 water_albedo = mix(float3(0.02, 0.06, 0.12),   // deep
                              float3(0.07, 0.18, 0.28),   // shallow
                              (1.0 - depth) * 0.6);
    m.albedo    = mix(water_albedo, float3(0.92, 0.94, 0.96), foam_mask);
    m.roughness = mix(0.08, 0.85, foam_mask);
    m.metallic  = 0.0;
    float3 ripple = float3(fbm8(wp.xzy * 8.0), fbm8(wp.xzy * 8.0 + float3(4.3,0,0)),
                           fbm8(wp.xzy * 8.0 + float3(0,8.7,0)));
    m.normal    = normalize(n + (ripple - 0.5) * 0.04 * (1.0 - foam_mask));
    m.emission  = float3(0.0);
    return m;
}
```

### 4.15 Ink (2D stylized)

`Materials/Exotic.metal:mat_ink` — flat emissive with curl-noise flow-field UV distortion.

```metal
// ink_color: ink tint (saturated colors read best).
// flow_uv: caller-computed distorted UV from a flow-map pass, or wp.xy/scale.
// t: accumulated audio time (FeatureVector.accumulated_audio_time).
MaterialResult mat_ink(float3 wp, float3 n, float3 ink_color, float2 flow_uv, float t) {
    MaterialResult m;
    float3 curl        = curl_noise(float3(flow_uv, t * 0.3));

}
```

### 4.17 Marble veining

`Materials/Exotic.metal:mat_marble` — curl-noise-warped Perlin veins, sharp bimodal colour split.

```metal
// Caller responsibilities: none.
// fbm8 output ≈ [-1, 1]; smoothstep centred at 0 gives correct bimodal split.

### 4.19 Sand with glints

`Materials/Exotic.metal:mat_sand_glints` — warm sand base with hash-lattice specular sparkle (Increment V.4).

    // POM displacement from procedural height (fbm8-based).
    // Use parallax_occlusion() from PBR/POM.metal when a real height tex is available.

    float3 height_grad = float3(h0 - hx, h0 - hy, 0.001) * 8.0;
    m.normal = normalize(n + height_grad * 0.12);

    m.emission = float3(0.0);

## 5. Lighting Recipes

### 5.1 Three-point classical

**Use for:** any preset with distinct subjects (Arachne spider, Fractal Tree branches, Kinetic Sculpture).

```json
{
  "scene_lights": [
    { "position": [ 3.0, 4.0, 2.0 ], "color": [1.00, 0.92, 0.80], "intensity": 3.0 },
    { "position": [-2.0, 1.5, 3.5 ], "color": [0.50, 0.70, 1.00], "intensity": 1.2 },
    { "position": [ 0.0, 3.0,-4.0 ], "color": [1.00, 0.65, 0.40], "intensity": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

Key = warm from above-right (3.0 intensity). Fill = cool from above-left (1.2). Rim = warm from behind (0.8). IBL ambient adds overall soft wash.

### 5.2 Single-directional + strong IBL

**Use for:** outdoor / terrain presets (Volumetric Lithograph, Ferrofluid Ocean).

Single light from sun angle, IBL does the heavy lifting. Tint IBL ambient per mood valence via `lightColor` multiplier (existing D-022 behavior). Keep the ambient floor low (IBL irradiance term in the lighting pass) so shadows have depth. (`scene_ambient` was removed at BUG-034 — it was dead config that never reached a shader; ambient character comes from IBL.)

### 5.3 Bioluminescent (rim + back-lit SSS)

**Use for:** Arachne spider easter-egg, Gossamer active emission state.

Minimal direct light. Each emissive surface acts as a light source (emission term). Add screen-space bloom to spread emission beyond geometry boundaries. For subjects with SSS (silk, chitin), back-position a soft area light so SSS pass produces rim-ward glow.

### 5.4 Underwater / submerged

**Use for:** hypothetical Ferrofluid Ocean viewed from below; any preset aiming for depth-of-vision distortion.

Directional key from above with cyan tint (`float3(0.4, 0.85, 0.95)`). Strong fog (`fog_factor = 0.08`, `fog_far = 25`). Caustic patterns projected onto surfaces via screen-space caustic texture modulated by `fbm8(p + t * 0.1)`. Depth-of-field post for far objects.

### 5.5 Night-city ambient

**Use for:** presets aiming for urban / neon vibe. Glass Brutalist could push this direction.

Multiple low-intensity colored point lights (magenta, cyan, deep orange) spread through the scene. High bloom threshold so only light sources and direct reflections bloom. IBL environment is dark-sky `float3(0.03, 0.03, 0.08)` — the dark IBL is what keeps the ambient floor near-black.

### 5.6 Golden hour

**Use for:** Volumetric Lithograph alternate palette; Murmuration warm-valence skies.

Directional light low in sky (y=0.2), warm orange (`float3(1.0, 0.55, 0.25)`), high intensity (4.0). IBL ambient tinted warm. Long shadows via low light angle. Atmospheric fog density 0.02–0.04 with strong Rayleigh-scattering tint: `fog_color = lerp(warm_orange, cool_blue, fog_depth_factor)`.

### 5.7 Lighting as audio reactive

Modulate light properties per music rather than geometry per music (D-020 principle — architecture stays solid, light moves).

| Audio | Light property | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `f.bass_att_rel` | Key light intensity (±10%) | Kick drives slow brightness breathing |
| `stems.drums_beat` | Rim light position orbit | Rim sweeps around subject on each beat |
| `f.valence` | Key light color temperature | Warm on major key, cool on minor |
| `f.arousal` | IBL ambient strength | High energy = brighter ambient |
| `stems.vocals_energy_dev` | Fill light pulse | Vocal presence brightens fill |

### 5.8 Stage lighting rig

**Implementation contract:** see [`docs/DECISIONS.md` D-125](DECISIONS.md). The JSON sidecar schema in D-125(e) is authoritative; the §5.8 example below is illustrative. First implementation landed in V.9 Session 3 (Ferrofluid Ocean).

**Use for:** Ferrofluid Ocean (V.9). Any future preset where moving colored beams over a dark reflective surface is the central chromatic story — that is, presets where chromatic content lives in reflections of moving scene lights rather than in surface albedo or IBL alone.

The stage rig is not the §5.5 night-city ambient recipe at higher intensity. Night-city is "many low-intensity colored point lights distributed through a scene"; the stage rig is "a small number of high-intensity colored beams in continuous orbital motion across a reflective surface." Night-city scatters illumination diffusely; the stage rig produces directional sweeps with specular pickup. The stage rig is also distinct from §5.7 (Lighting as audio reactive), which is a per-property modulation table on an otherwise-static three-point rig; §5.8 *replaces* the three-point rig with continuous orbital motion as the lighting paradigm.

**Light configuration:**

```json
{
  "scene_lights": [
    { "position_path": "orbit_above", "color": "palette_phase_0",   "intensity": "drums_dev_envelope" },
    { "position_path": "orbit_above", "color": "palette_phase_120", "intensity": "drums_dev_envelope" },
    { "position_path": "orbit_above", "color": "palette_phase_240", "intensity": "drums_dev_envelope" },
    { "position_path": "orbit_above", "color": "palette_phase_60",  "intensity": "drums_dev_envelope" }
  ]
}
```

Tier 1 uses 3 lights; Tier 2 uses 4–6. Light positions follow parametric orbital paths above the scene (`y > 0`, sweeping in azimuth around a center point that is the camera's forward focus); orbit angular velocity is `0.05 + arousal_smooth * 0.15` rad/sec (very slow at silence, moderately animated at peak energy). Lights are point-light type with high intensity (4.0–6.0 nominal) so that specular reflections on near-mirror surfaces (`roughness ≤ 0.10`) produce sharp visible highlights from the camera angle.

**Color rotation:**

Each light's color is `palette(audio_time * 0.05 + per_light_phase_offset + pitch_shift, palette_params)`. The `pitch_shift` term is computed inline in the shader from `stems.vocals_pitch_hz` — there is no precomputed `*_norm` field (it was retired in DSP.2 S9 along with `normalizePitch`). Recommended normalization: `pitch_shift = (log2(max(stems.vocals_pitch_hz, 80.0) / 80.0) / log2(1000.0 / 80.0)) * 0.2` (perceptual mapping over the 80 Hz–1 kHz vocal range, scaled to ±0.2 of palette phase). Confidence-gate at `stems.vocals_pitch_confidence >= 0.6`; below that, substitute `pitch_shift = stems.other_energy_dev * 0.15` (chromatic rotation from harmonic-content density). The slow base rotation (`audio_time * 0.05`) gives continuous chromatic motion independent of audio, so beams visibly evolve in color even during instrumental passages with stable centroid. Per-light phase offsets (120° / 240° / etc. in palette phase) ensure adjacent beams are in different chromatic regions of the palette at any instant, producing visible chromatic variety across the reflection field.

**Intensity envelope:**

Each light's intensity is `base_intensity * (0.4 + 0.6 * drums_energy_dev_smoothed)` where `drums_energy_dev_smoothed` is the deviation primitive smoothed with 150ms τ to prevent jitter on per-frame onset variation. The 0.4 floor preserves visible beam presence at silence (per D-019); the 0.6 swing on top responds to drum energy continuously. Never edge-trigger on `drums_beat` for intensity — that produces club-strobe behavior, which is anti per the Ferrofluid Ocean anti-references list. **Enforced, not just advisory (CLEAN.7.6 / D-164):** `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests` renders each certified preset over a worst-case beat train and measures the rendered full-frame luminance against the Harding / WCAG 2.3.1 limit (≤ 3 flashes/s), **failing certification** on violation. A preset over threshold is a P1 safety finding to bring to Matt, not a number to tune away. (Enforcement is a dual harness since CLEAN.7.6c: the single-pass FeatureVector gate covers in-shader-reactive presets, and `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` runs a headless real-`RenderPipeline` multi-pass render for follower-state / multi-pass / feedback presets — with a fail-loud static-render guard so a NEW certified preset that renders static there must join the harness rather than silently pass. Updated at PUB.3; this parenthetical previously said the multi-pass harness was still pending.)

**Silence state:**

At `totalStemEnergy == 0`: beams continue orbiting at minimum angular velocity (`0.05 rad/sec`); each beam intensity sits at the 0.4 floor; colors are at the default palette phase with no pitch-shift contribution; chromatic motion still visible via the slow base rotation (`audio_time * 0.05`). The visual destination at silence is "a quiet stage with the rig idling," not "stage rig off." This preserves the calm-but-alive silence aesthetic per `10_silence_calm_body.jpg` for Ferrofluid Ocean and is the recommended default for any future preset adopting this recipe.

**IBL coordination:**

The stage rig is additive to IBL ambient, not a replacement. IBL is still tinted by D-022 mood valence and provides scene-wide soft ambient illumination; the stage rig provides directional specular sweeps over that base. The IBL ambient floor stays low so that beam highlights have visible shadow contrast against the unlit substrate.

**Cost:**

Per-light evaluation is ~0.10–0.15 ms at the lighting pass on Tier 2; 4–6 lights total ~0.5–0.9 ms. The orbital-path math is per-light per-frame on CPU (negligible). The pitch-confidence gating and palette lookups are per-light per-pixel in the lighting pass.

**Failure modes (anti-pattern):**

- **Beat-strobed intensity.** Beam intensity edge-triggered on `drums_beat` rather than enveloped on `drums_energy_dev`. Produces club lighting.
- **Saturated party palette without mood coordination.** Beam colors hardcoded to primary RGB or cycled through high-saturation hues without going through `palette()` and the D-022 mood path. Produces birthday-disco aesthetic.
- **Beam motion edge-triggered on beat.** Orbit speed or direction changing on `*_beat` events rather than smoothly varying with arousal. Produces jittery, untrustworthy motion.
- **Pillar reflections.** Reading the stage rig as point sources rather than as beam sweeps — i.e. each light's reflection collapsing to a sharp vertical pillar on the surface (moon-on-lake aesthetic) rather than a diffuse gradient. The cure: high light intensity + surface roughness ≥ 0.05 to spread the specular lobe, and sufficient angular distance between lights so beam reflections do not constructively pillar at the same vertical.

## 6. Volume and Participating Media

### 6.1 The ground-fog recipe

Every ray-march preset should have at least this level of atmosphere. Hero geometry without air fades to aerial-perspective color with depth.

```metal
// Volume/ParticipatingMedia.metal — apply_fog (snake_case alias, Increment V.4)
// (A legacy camelCase `fog()` once lived in ShaderUtilities.metal; it had no callers
// and was deleted at RECON.16 — use apply_fog.)
static inline float3 apply_fog(float3 color, float depth,
                                float3 fog_color, float fog_density) {
    float transmittance = exp(-depth * fog_density);
    return mix(fog_color, color, transmittance);
}
```

Set `fog_color` to match the scene's sky or horizon color, not gray. Grey fog looks like a printing defect.

### 6.2 Volumetric light shafts (god rays)

**Use for:** Glass Brutalist through-window lighting, any preset with dramatic directional light through a structured environment.

`Volume/LightShafts.metal` provides two approaches:

**Screen-space radial blur** (cheap, direct-pass presets): accumulate radially toward the projected sun UV using the existing rendered scene as an occlusion mask.

```metal
// Volume/LightShafts.metal (Increment V.2)

// Get the UV to sample at step i (0-indexed) of a radial blur toward sunUV.
static inline float2 ls_radial_step_uv(float2 uv, float2 sunUV, int step, int totalSteps);

// Contribution of one step given a pre-sampled occlusion value [0=shadow, 1=lit].
static inline float ls_radial_accumulate_step(float occlusion, float decay, float weight, int step);

// Simple usage (fragment body):
//   float2 sunSS = ls_world_to_ndc(viewProj, lightWorldPos);  // project light to UV
//   float shafts = 0.0;
//   for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
//       float2 sUV  = ls_radial_step_uv(uv, sunSS, i, 32);
//       float  occ  = sceneTex.sample(s, sUV).a;   // use alpha or luma as mask
//       shafts += ls_radial_accumulate_step(occ, 0.95, 0.02, i);
//   }
//   finalColor += lightColor * shafts * ls_intensity_audio(0.3, midRel);
```

**Ray-march shadow-volume** (accurate, ray-march presets): step from each visible point toward the light, accumulating density from `vol_density_fbm`.

```metal
// March from p toward lightDir, return shadow factor [0,1].
// steps = 8–16 (cheap shadow rays acceptable for atmospheric quality).
static inline float ls_shadow_march(float3 p, float3 lightDir,
                                    float tMax, int steps, float sigma);

// Sun disk + soft corona (add to final color for miss-rays or sky pixels).
static inline float3 ls_sun_disk(float3 rd, float3 sunDir, float3 sunColor);

// Intensity scaled by midRel — shafts brighten on vocal/melody presence.
static inline float ls_intensity_audio(float baseIntensity, float midRel);
```

Cost: screen-space ≈ 0.5 ms (32 samples); ray-march shadow ≈ 1.5 ms (48 steps). Sample at half-res + upscale if budget tight.

**Sky-only-fragment variant (no occlusion mask):** when the shaft is drawn into a backdrop fragment that has no scene texture to sample, substitute a perpendicular-distance cone mask for the per-step occlusion read. At each `ls_radial_step_uv` sample, evaluate `1 - smoothstep(0, coneHalfWidth, perpFromAxis)` where `perpFromAxis` is the perpendicular distance from the sample UV to the shaft's central axis (the line from `sunUV` through frame centre, or any anchor of the shader's choice). `coneHalfWidth` typically widens with along-axis distance from the sun (e.g. `0.04 + 0.12 * along`). The accumulator otherwise behaves identically. For per-particle hue at emission time, hash a hue from `stems.vocalsPitchHz` / `stems.vocalsPitchConfidence` (octave-wrap log map, e.g. A2→0.0, A6→1.0) and apply the D-019 stem-warmup blend `smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, totalStemEnergy)` against a cold-stems fallback hue derived from `f.mid_att_rel`.

### 6.3 Dust motes

**Use for:** Arachne spider easter-egg reveal, Gossamer bioluminescent ambient, any scene that wants air-as-material.

`Volume/ParticipatingMedia.metal` provides front-to-back integration for procedural dust/mist volumes:

```metal
// Volume/ParticipatingMedia.metal (Increment V.2)

struct VolumeSample { float3 color; float transmittance; };
static inline VolumeSample vol_sample_zero();

// Density field options (choose based on desired look):
static inline float vol_density_fbm(float3 p, float scale, int octaves);     // heterogeneous mist
static inline float vol_density_height_fog(float3 p, float scale, float falloff); // floor fog
static inline float vol_density_sphere(float3 p, float3 c, float r);         // blob of haze
static inline float vol_density_cloud(float3 p, float scale, float coverage); // wispy clouds

// Accumulate one step (front-to-back). Call in a ray-march loop:
//   VolumeSample s = vol_sample_zero();
//   for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
//       float3 pos = ro + rd * (tMin + stepLen * (float(i) + 0.5));
//       float  den = vol_density_fbm(pos * 3.0 + curl_noise(pos) * 0.4, 1.0, 3);
//       den *= smoothstep(0.0, 0.05, bassRel);   // swell on transients
//       s = vol_accumulate(s, pos, rd, den, stepLen, lightDir, lightColor, 0.1);
//       if (s.transmittance < 0.01) break;
//   }
//   float3 dustColor = s.color + background * s.transmittance;
static inline VolumeSample vol_accumulate(VolumeSample s, float3 p, float3 rd,
    float density, float stepLen, float3 lightDir, float3 lightColor, float sigma);
```

**Approach A (compute particles)**: 5000–20000 motes advected by `curl_noise`, rendered as sprite quads. Lit by scene lights via Lambert. Cost: 2–3 ms.

**Approach B (screen-space)**: sample a 2D noise texture offset by `time * drift_velocity`, threshold for sparkle locations, add to bloom input. Cost: <0.5 ms. Adequate for subtle ambient sparkle.

Both visibly upgrade "empty air" to "inhabited space." Approach B is recommended unless the motes need to respond to geometry.

### 6.4 Volumetric bloom (shaped)

The default `PostProcessChain` bloom (ACES composite + Gaussian pyramid) is adequate but uniform. Shaped bloom — where high-intensity pixels bloom more aggressively along specific directions — is what makes "bright emissive" look like "actual light source."

Two shaping approaches:

- **Anamorphic streaks**: horizontal stretch of bloom, 3× wider than vertical. Instant sci-fi look.
- **Star-point spikes**: 4-point or 6-point spikes extending from brightest pixels. Photographic lens flare aesthetic.

Both are ~0.3 ms additions to the existing bloom chain. Implement as optional flags per-preset in `PresetDescriptor`.

### 6.5 Single luminous body — the volumetric detail cascade (V.2-Volume consumer)

**Use for:** a *single coherent gaseous body* suspended in a void (Nimbus) — not frame-filling atmosphere (that's §6.1/§6.3). The body must have a centre of mass, a legible silhouette, internal billow/lobe structure, and edges that dissolve into the void. The failure mode at every step is **uniform fog** (no centre, no negative space) and its opposite, **a solid-surface blob** (opaque, hard-edged). Reference implementation: `Nimbus.metal` (the first preset to compose the V.2 Volume tree). Cost: macro+meso+micro **p50 ≈ 1.65 ms @ 1080p** on M-series (64 march steps, 6 `noiseVolume` taps/in-body step), well inside the 7 ms Tier-2 ceiling.

**The non-negotiable budget rule (D-140 / `NIMBUS_DESIGN §6.1`): volumetric noise is a TEXTURE SAMPLE, never computed per march step.** Per-step `fbm4` was ~20 ms @1080p (2.9× over budget) and *half-res* was still 7.5 ms — the dominant cost is the per-step ALU (4× `perlin3d`/step), not the resolution. Sampling the preamble **64³ tileable 3D `noiseVolume`** (`[[texture(6)]]`, production-bound via `TextureManager.bindNoiseTextures`) instead dropped it to 1.37 ms. The corollary: **the cost is the per-step ALU, not the sample count** — adding the meso/micro octaves (3 → 6 taps/step) cost only +0.28 ms because the body early-out keeps most steps free. Add octaves freely *as texture taps*. Use the **true-3D `noiseVolume`**, not a 2D texture (`noiseHQ`/`noiseFBM`) — a 2D sample in a 3D march gives columnar artifacts (constant along the projected axis). `blueNoise` (2D) is fine for screen-space step-jitter.

**Shape a BOUNDED body first (the macro envelope).** An analytic envelope — ellipsoidal shell × gaussian core boost — gives the silhouette + dense-core read for free, with no noise cost, and doubles as a cheap self-shadow field. Skip the noise entirely outside the body (the early-out is what makes the march affordable):

```metal
// 1 at the dense core → 0 at the shell. Cheap; also the self-shadow field.
static inline float body_envelope(float3 p, thread float& rrOut) {
    float3 bp = p / kSemiAxes;       // ellipsoid → unit sphere
    float  rr = length(bp); rrOut = rr;
    float  shell = smoothstep(1.05, 0.12, rr);              // bounded silhouette
    float  core  = 0.50 + 1.05 * exp(-rr * rr * 3.2);       // gaussian core boost
    return shell * core;
}
// In the march loop: float env = body_envelope(p, rr);
//                     if (env <= 0.001) continue;          // <-- the budget saver
```

**Meso billows must CARVE the envelope multiplicatively, not modulate it additively.** Additive detail (`env * mix(floor, peak, detail)`) just brightens an already-opaque core and the lumps wash out into the solid-surface failure. Make the lobe field *thin the body toward transparency in the valleys* so the density iso-surface is genuinely lumpy:

```metal
float lobeA  = noiseVol.sample(s, q * 0.7).r;       // coarse billows
float lobeB  = noiseVol.sample(s, q * 1.4).r;       // nested sub-billows (octave-doubled)
float billow = smoothstep(0.35, 0.70, lobeA*0.62 + lobeB*0.38);  // tight → crisp lump/valley
float lobeCarve = mix(0.14, 1.10, billow);          // valleys thin to 0.14·env, crests > 1
float dens = env * lobeCarve * roil;                // roil = interior turbulence texture
```

**Render TRANSLUCENT so front-to-back accumulation reads lobe depth — no extra lighting needed.** A near-opaque body (high σ) shows only a flat front surface. Drop the extinction σ until light scatters *through* the volume (Nimbus: σ ≈ 1.55): the march's own front-to-back accumulation then makes lobe crests (more density stacked along the ray) brighter than valleys, and near lobes attenuate far ones — a real depth read with zero lobe-to-lobe shadow work. (Lobe-to-lobe *shadow lighting* is a separate, later increment; the *density* depth read comes free from σ + accumulation.)

**Micro filaments — domain-warp the texture COORDINATE with a cheap second tap, never `fbm_vec3`/`warped_fbm`.** Those helpers compute `fbm8` internally (~56 perlin evals) and re-blow the budget. `noiseVolume` is single-channel, so build a 2-axis swirl offset from two decorrelated low-freq taps and apply it to the fine octave's coordinate — that stretches isotropic noise into curling tendrils:

```metal
float w0 = noiseVol.sample(s, q*0.9).r - 0.5;
float w1 = noiseVol.sample(s, q*0.9 + float3(4.7,1.3,8.1)).r - 0.5;   // decorrelated tap
float3 qw   = q + float3(w0, w1, (w0-w1)*0.5) * kWarpAmt;             // swirled coords
float micro = noiseVol.sample(s, qw * 5.6).r;                        // warped fine filaments
```

**Edge feathering MULTIPLIES the rim by a filament mask — don't subtract a smooth amount.** Subtraction blurs the whole rim into a soft uniform falloff; a multiplicative mask breaks the rim into discrete curling filaments separated by void (the warp curls them). Keep the core (low `rr`) unmasked so the body stays one coherent mass; the mask is continuous noise so the edge never hard-cuts:

```metal
float rim   = smoothstep(0.48, 1.06, rr);                    // 0 core → 1 shell
float fil   = clamp(smoothstep(0.34,0.64,micro)*0.74         // fine tendrils
                  + smoothstep(0.28,0.74,billow)*0.42, 0,1); // + larger lobe gaps
dens *= mix(1.0, fil, rim);                                  // rim dissolves to tendrils
```

**Expose interior turbulence as one named amplitude constant** (`kNimbusTurbulence`) scaling the roil term, so a mood/arousal route can later modulate placid ↔ churning without touching the field structure. Keep a **density-only debug view** (accumulated opacity, no lighting) as the load-bearing guard — it must always show a bounded body with dominant negative space and feathered edges; if it fills the frame you've drifted into uniform fog, and **raising global density is never the way to add detail** (detail is structure, not opacity). A **step-count heatmap** validates the early-out (cost confined to the body).

## 7. SDF Craft

### 7.1 Smooth union with multi-node blending

`op_smooth_union` as commonly written blends two SDFs. Most ray-march scenes need to blend N SDFs (N > 2) without nesting binary unions (which causes visible triple-points).

Metal fragment shaders cannot take pointer arrays, so the utility provides fixed-arity variants using log-sum-exp exponential smooth-min:

```metal
// Geometry/SDFBoolean.metal — op_blend_4, op_blend_8, op_blend (Increment V.2)

// 2-distance blend (degrades to min() at k < 0.001)
static inline float op_blend(float a, float b, float k) {
    if (k < 0.001) return min(a, b);
    float m   = min(a, b);
    float sum = exp((m - a) / k) + exp((m - b) / k);
    return m - k * log(sum);
}

// 4-distance blend — covers most preset use cases
static inline float op_blend_4(float d0, float d1, float d2, float d3, float k) {
    float m   = min(min(d0, d1), min(d2, d3));
    float sum = exp((m-d0)/k) + exp((m-d1)/k)
              + exp((m-d2)/k) + exp((m-d3)/k);
    return m - k * log(sum);
}

// 8-distance blend — web intersections, complex multi-primitive scenes
static inline float op_blend_8(
    float d0, float d1, float d2, float d3,
    float d4, float d5, float d6, float d7, float k
) {
    float m   = min(min(min(d0,d1),min(d2,d3)), min(min(d4,d5),min(d6,d7)));
    float sum = exp((m-d0)/k) + exp((m-d1)/k) + exp((m-d2)/k) + exp((m-d3)/k)
              + exp((m-d4)/k) + exp((m-d5)/k) + exp((m-d6)/k) + exp((m-d7)/k);
    return m - k * log(sum);
}
```

Use for: Murmuration flock clustering, Arachne web intersections (where radial meets spiral meets hub), organic tendril structures.

### 7.2 Proper displacement (Lipschitz-aware)

Displacement adds surface detail but can break sphere-tracing if displacement amplitude is large relative to feature size. The fix is to scale the returned distance by a safety factor.

```metal
float sd_displaced(float3 p, float base_sdf, float displacement, float safety = 0.6) {
    return (base_sdf - displacement) * safety;
}
```

Safety factor 0.6 is standard. Can tune down to 0.4 for high-frequency displacement, up to 0.8 for gentle.

### 7.3 Tetrahedral normal calculation

The cheapest high-quality SDF normal: sample four points in tetrahedral arrangement, combine.

```metal
// Geometry/RayMarch.metal:ray_march_normal_tetra (Increment V.2)
// Replace sd_sphere(q, 1.0) with your sceneSDF(q) in fragment shaders.
static inline float3 ray_march_normal_tetra(float3 p, float eps) {
    const float2 k = float2(1.0, -1.0);
    return normalize(
        k.xyy * sd_sphere(p + k.xyy * eps, 1.0) +
        k.yyx * sd_sphere(p + k.yyx * eps, 1.0) +
        k.yxy * sd_sphere(p + k.yxy * eps, 1.0) +
        k.xxx * sd_sphere(p + k.xxx * eps, 1.0)
    );
}
```

Four scene evaluations. Use this, not the six-tap central difference.

Practical use in a preset fragment shader:
```metal
// Inline the SDF call directly — Metal fragment shaders cannot pass function pointers.
float3 n = normalize(
    float2(1,-1).xyy * sceneSDF(p + float2(1,-1).xyy * 0.001) +
    float2(1,-1).yyx * sceneSDF(p + float2(1,-1).yyx * 0.001) +
    float2(1,-1).yxy * sceneSDF(p + float2(1,-1).yxy * 0.001) +
    float2(1,-1).xxx * sceneSDF(p + float2(1,-1).xxx * 0.001)
);
```

### 7.4 Adaptive sphere tracing

Fixed-step ray march burns cycles. Sphere tracing is the standard SDF march. Adaptive sphere tracing further accelerates by over-stepping in open space via a configurable relaxation factor.

```metal
// Geometry/RayMarch.metal:RayMarchHit + ray_march_adaptive (Increment V.2)
struct RayMarchHit {
    float distance;  // t along the ray (world position = ro + rd * hit.distance)
    int   steps;
    bool  hit;
};

// gradFactor: 0.0 = standard sphere tracing; 0.5 = 50% over-relaxed (recommended).
// Replace sd_sphere(p, 1.0) with your sceneSDF(p) when copying into fragment shaders.
static inline RayMarchHit ray_march_adaptive(
    float3 ro, float3 rd,
    float tMin, float tMax,
    int   maxSteps,
    float hitEps,
    float gradFactor
) {
    RayMarchHit result = { 0.0, 0, false };
    float omega = 1.0 + gradFactor;
    float t = tMin;
    for (int i = 0; i < maxSteps && t < tMax; i++) {
        float d = sd_sphere(ro + rd * t, 1.0);  // REPLACE with sceneSDF
        result.steps++;
        if (d < hitEps) {
            result.hit = true; result.distance = t; return result;
        }
        t += max(d * omega, 0.001);
    }
    return result;
}
```

Cost: ~30–50% fewer steps on average than basic sphere tracing in open scenes. Worth it at maxSteps = 64+.

### 7.5 Per-primitive material IDs

When a scene has multiple materials, encode material ID in the SDF return alongside distance. A common pattern is returning a `float2(distance, material_id)`. The G-buffer pass then dispatches to the right `mat_*` recipe per hit.

```metal
float2 scene_sdf_with_material(float3 p) {
    float2 result = float2(1e10, -1.0);
    // Primitive 1: silk threads (material ID 1)
    float d1 = sd_silk_threads(p);
    if (d1 < result.x) result = float2(d1, 1.0);
    // Primitive 2: spider body (material ID 2)
    float d2 = sd_spider(p);
    if (d2 < result.x) result = float2(d2, 2.0);
    // Primitive 3: background sphere (material ID 0)
    float d3 = sd_bg_sphere(p);
    if (d3 < result.x) result = float2(d3, 0.0);
    return result;
}
```

Preset-authored `sceneMaterial()` dispatches on material_id to populate G-buffer.

## 8. Texturing Beyond Noise

### 8.1 Triplanar projection

The single highest-leverage non-noise technique. Projects textures along three world-axis planes and blends by normal alignment. Avoids the UV-mapping problem entirely on procedural geometry.

```metal
float3 triplanar_sample(texture2d<float> tex, sampler s, float3 wp, float3 n, float tiling) {
    float3 blend = pow(abs(n), float3(4.0));
    blend /= dot(blend, float3(1.0));
    float3 x = tex.sample(s, wp.yz * tiling).rgb;
    float3 y = tex.sample(s, wp.xz * tiling).rgb;
    float3 z = tex.sample(s, wp.xy * tiling).rgb;
    return x * blend.x + y * blend.y + z * blend.z;
}
```

Use everywhere you'd normally use 2D UVs on non-flat geometry: concrete walls, stone, bark, any extruded SDF.

### 8.2 Triplanar normal mapping with re-orientation

Naive triplanar of normal maps produces incorrect results — the tangent frame differs per axis plane. The fix uses Reoriented Normal Mapping (RNM): lifts tangent-space normals per-face into world space using each face's implicit tangent/bitangent basis.

```metal
// PBR/Triplanar.metal:triplanar_normal (Increment V.1)
static inline float3 triplanar_normal(
    texture2d<float> nmap, sampler samp,
    float3 wp, float3 n, float tiling
) {
    float3 w  = triplanar_blend_weights(n, 4.0);

    float3 nXZ = decode_normal_map(nmap.sample(samp, wp.xz * tiling).rgb);
    float3 nXY = decode_normal_map(nmap.sample(samp, wp.xy * tiling).rgb);
    float3 nYZ = decode_normal_map(nmap.sample(samp, wp.yz * tiling).rgb);

    // RNM: reorient each face's tangent-space normal to world space.
    // XZ face: tangent=+X, bitangent=+Z, normal=+Y
    float3 wsXZ = float3(nXZ.x, nXZ.z, nXZ.y + sign(n.y));
    // XY face: tangent=+X, bitangent=+Y, normal=+Z
    float3 wsXY = float3(nXY.x, nXY.y, nXY.z + sign(n.z));
    // YZ face: tangent=+Z, bitangent=+Y, normal=+X
    float3 wsYZ = float3(nYZ.z + sign(n.x), nYZ.y, nYZ.x);

    return normalize(wsXZ * w.y + wsXY * w.z + wsYZ * w.x);
}
```

**Procedural 3-param overload (no texture).** `Materials/MaterialResult.metal` provides `triplanar_normal(wp, n, amplitude)` and `triplanar_detail_normal(base_n, wp, amplitude)` that perturb a normal with fbm8 noise triplanarly — no texture required. Used by `mat_wet_stone`, `mat_bark`, `mat_granite`.

### 8.3 Parallax occlusion mapping (POM)

**Use for:** making concrete, bark, stone walls look like they have real depth rather than a normal map lie.

POM samples a heightmap along the view ray to find the correct surface displacement point. Expensive but the visual difference is dramatic.

`PBR/POM.metal` provides two forms. Basic POM returns the displaced UV only; the shadowed variant also returns a self-shadow factor for contact shadows inside deep features (reference: Morgan McGuire 2005).

```metal
// PBR/POM.metal (Increment V.1)

// Result type for the shadowed variant.
struct POMResult {
    float2 uv;          // displaced UV — use for all subsequent texture samples
    float  self_shadow; // [0,1] multiply into direct lighting; 0 = fully shadowed
};

// Basic POM: 32-step linear search + 8-step binary refinement.
// view_ts = view direction in tangent space (use ws_to_ts()).
// depth_scale: 0.02 = subtle brick mortar, 0.1 = deep rock.
static inline float2 parallax_occlusion(
    texture2d<float> height_tex, sampler samp,
    float2 uv, float3 view_ts, float depth_scale
) {
    const int linear_steps = 32;
    const int binary_steps = 8;
    float  layer_depth = 1.0 / float(linear_steps);
    float2 delta_uv    = (view_ts.xy / view_ts.z) * depth_scale / float(linear_steps);
    float  curr_depth  = 0.0;
    float2 curr_uv     = uv;
    float  curr_height = 1.0 - height_tex.sample(samp, curr_uv).r;
    for (int i = 0; i < linear_steps; i++) {
        if (curr_depth >= curr_height) break;
        curr_uv     -= delta_uv;
        curr_height  = 1.0 - height_tex.sample(samp, curr_uv).r;
        curr_depth  += layer_depth;
    }
    // Binary refinement between last two layers (Morgan McGuire 2005).
    float2 prev_uv    = curr_uv + delta_uv;
    float  prev_depth = curr_depth - layer_depth;
    for (int i = 0; i < binary_steps; i++) {
        float2 mid_uv    = (curr_uv + prev_uv) * 0.5;
        float  mid_depth = (curr_depth + prev_depth) * 0.5;
        float  mid_h     = 1.0 - height_tex.sample(samp, mid_uv).r;
        if (mid_depth >= mid_h) { curr_uv = mid_uv; curr_depth = mid_depth; }
        else                    { prev_uv = mid_uv; prev_depth = mid_depth; }
    }
    return (curr_uv + prev_uv) * 0.5;
}

// Shadowed variant — 2× more expensive; returns POMResult.
// light_ts = light direction in tangent space (use ws_to_ts() with the light dir).
static inline POMResult parallax_occlusion_shadowed(
    texture2d<float> height_tex, sampler samp,
    float2 uv, float3 view_ts, float3 light_ts, float depth_scale
);
```

Cost: ~1.0 ms per full-screen POM pass at 1080p on Tier 2 (basic), ~2.0 ms shadowed. Use sparingly on hero surfaces only.

### 8.4 Detail normals

Layer multiple normal-map scales: a macro normal map at base UV frequency, plus a detail normal at 20× UV frequency. `PBR/DetailNormals.metal` provides two blending modes:

```metal
// PBR/DetailNormals.metal (Increment V.1)

// UDN (Unity Detail Normal) blend — industry standard.
// Preserves detail scale without tilting the base normal.
// Both inputs are tangent-space normals (z-up convention).
static inline float3 combine_normals_udn(float3 base, float3 detail) {
    return normalize(float3(base.xy + detail.xy, base.z));
}

// Whiteout blend — more accurate when the base normal is itself steeply tilted.
// ~5% more expensive than UDN.
static inline float3 combine_normals_whiteout(float3 base, float3 detail) {
    float3 n = float3(
        base.x * detail.z + detail.x * base.z,
        base.y * detail.z + detail.y * base.z,
        base.z * detail.z
    );
    return normalize(n);
}
```

Use UDN for almost all cases. Switch to whiteout only when the base normal is tilted >45° (unusual geometry, e.g., overhanging rock).

Use for: bark (bark grooves + fine texture), sand (dunes + grain), any weathered surface.

### 8.5 Flow maps

For liquid surfaces: encode 2D flow-velocity vectors in an RG texture (or derive them procedurally from curl noise). Offset UVs per frame by the velocity. Two-phase mixing hides the repeating cycle. `Texture/FlowMaps.metal` decomposes this into composable helpers:

```metal
// Texture/FlowMaps.metal (Increment V.2)

// Compute distorted UV at animation phase [0,1].
// velocity  = flow direction + speed (decode from RG texture: vel = sample.rg*2-1)
// phase     = fract(time / period)  — caller controls cycle rate
// strength  = displacement amplitude (0.05–0.15 typical)
static inline float2 flow_sample_offset(float2 uv, float2 velocity, float phase, float strength) {
    return uv + velocity * (phase - 0.5) * strength;
}

// Smooth blend weight for dual-phase sampling (crossfades at phase 0 and 0.5).
// Weight for phase B = 1.0 - flow_blend_weight(phase).
static inline float flow_blend_weight(float phase) {
    return 1.0 - smoothstep(0.4, 0.6, fract(phase));
}

// Typical usage (texture-based):
//   float2 vel  = flowTex.sample(s, uv).rg * 2.0 - 1.0;
//   float  ph   = fract(time * 0.5);
//   float2 uv0  = flow_sample_offset(uv, vel, ph,       strength);
//   float2 uv1  = flow_sample_offset(uv, vel, ph + 0.5, strength);
//   float  w    = flow_blend_weight(ph);
//   float3 col  = baseTex.sample(s, uv0).rgb * w + baseTex.sample(s, uv1).rgb * (1.0 - w);

// Procedural alternative (no texture needed):
//   float2 vel = flow_noise_velocity(uv, scale, t);   // gradient of perlin3d
//   float2 vel = flow_curl_velocity(uv, scale, t);    // 2D curl of perlin3d
//   float2 distortedUV = flow_curl_advect(uv, scale, t, dt, strength);
```

Use for: ocean surface flow, ink-style presets, lava, any surface with directional streaming motion. The procedural variants (`flow_curl_advect`, `flow_noise_velocity`) need no texture and cost ~2 perlin samples each.

## 9. Performance Guidance

### 9.1 Frame budget anchors

Target: 16.6 ms per frame (60 fps). Breakdown on M3 Pro (Tier 2) at 1080p:

| Pass | Typical cost | Budget fraction |
|---|---|---|
| Ray march G-buffer (64 steps, 3 materials) | 2.5–4.0 ms | 15–24% |
| PBR lighting + IBL | 1.0–1.5 ms | 6–9% |
| SSGI (8-sample spiral, half-res) | 0.8–1.2 ms | 5–7% |
| Post-process (bloom + ACES) | 1.0 ms | 6% |
| `mv_warp` (3-pass) | 0.6 ms | 4% |
| Stem separation (MPSGraph, every 5 s) | 142 ms amortized | 1.4% averaged |
| MIR pipeline | <0.5 ms CPU | trivial |
| Swift render-loop overhead | 1.0 ms | 6% |
| **Ceiling for preset-specific work** | **~7 ms** | **~40%** |

The 7 ms ceiling is where preset fidelity ambition plays out. Big techniques cost real percent of this:

- POM full-screen: 1.0 ms (14% of ceiling)
- Volumetric light shafts: 1.5 ms (21% of ceiling)
- Volumetric clouds full-quality: 3.0 ms (43% of ceiling)
- Triplanar sampling: ~0.3 ms per surface type
- 8-octave fBM per-pixel: 0.8 ms per full-screen usage

### 9.2 Budgeting strategies

**Budget within `sceneMaterial()` not `sceneSDF()`.** Material calculations run once per ray hit; SDF evaluations run many times per ray. A heavy `sceneMaterial` with multiple noise calls and triplanar samples is fine; the same work inside `sceneSDF` compounds.

**Sample noise once, reuse.** Computing `fbm8(p)` three times inside the same shader is waste. Compute once into a variable.

**Prefer half-res for SSGI / volumetric / caustics.** MetalFX Temporal upscale handles reconstruction (Increment 3.16 planned).

**Avoid dynamic loops with variable iteration counts.** GPU divergence is expensive. Fixed loop counts with early-exit (`break` on convergence) compile well.

**Amortize across frames for slowly-changing terms.** SSGI, long-range AO, IBL pre-filtering — temporal accumulation with blue-noise jitter.

### 9.3 Tier 1 vs Tier 2 differentiation

Every preset should specify `complexity_cost: {"tier1": X, "tier2": Y}` in its JSON sidecar. Orchestrator excludes presets whose tier cost exceeds frame budget. From `CLAUDE.md`:

- Tier 1 (M1/M2): stricter ceilings. 5 ms per preset max. No volumetric clouds. No full-screen POM. Simplified mesh shader fallbacks.
- Tier 2 (M3+): full ambition. 7 ms per preset max. All techniques available. MetalFX Temporal Upscaling can rescue 25% of budget.

The `FrameBudgetManager` (Increment 6.2) downshifts at runtime when measured frames exceed budget — disables SSGI, reduces ray march steps, reduces particle count. Design presets to degrade gracefully under these reductions.

### 9.4 Cost of specific recipes (reference table)

Two-column table: Tier 1 (M1/M2) estimated via ~2.3× ratio from Tier 2 measurements; Tier 2 (M3+) measured via GPU timestamps at 1080p. Run `PERF_TESTS=1 swift test --filter UtilityPerformanceTests` and then `swift run UtilityCostTableUpdater` to regenerate.

<!-- END V4 PERF TABLE -->

**Surprises (V.4 calibration notes):**
- `mat_granite` is the heaviest cookbook material at ~1.9 ms — three noise calls at different scales + triplanar. Use per-hit, not per-pixel.
- `mat_ocean` approaches the ray-march G-buffer budget at ~2.6 ms. Combine with reduced raymarch steps (64→48) when using mat_ocean.
- `curl_noise` costs 6× `fbm8` (it's 6 finite-difference fbm8 samples) — always call once per hit point, never per-pixel in isolation.
- `warped_fbm` (7× fbm8) is not in the benchmark table; estimated ~5.5 ms — use only on hero geometry, never full-screen.
- `hex_tile_uv` is essentially free (~0.04 ms) and should be used liberally for any surface needing repeating patterns without UV seams.

For primitives not in this table, estimate ~0.04 ms per `perlin3d` call and scale by octave count.

### 9.5 Profiling every new preset

Before a new preset is certified: run `swift test --filter PresetPerformanceTests` with synthetic 60-second captures on silence, steady mid-energy, and beat-heavy fixtures from `Increment 5.2`. Record p50 / p95 / p99 / max frame time. Any p95 > tier budget is a fail.

## 10. Per-Preset Fidelity Playbook

Concrete uplift recipes for the five presets Matt called out. Each references sections above.

### 10.1 Arachne (V.8 — see `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md`)

**This section is superseded by `docs/presets/ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md` (2026-05-02).** The compositing-anchored sketch below was a partial design that didn't yet incorporate Matt's design conversation about (a) the construction-sequence-as-subject reframing prompted by the BBC Earth time-lapse references and (b) the orchestrator-side change to support multi-segment-per-track preset transitions on preset-declared cadences. The full v8 design lives in the dedicated doc.

The sketch below is preserved only for context — it documents the architectural pivot from V.7.5 (constant-tweaking) to compositing layers. The implementation plan in `ARACHNE_V8_DESIGN.md` §6 supersedes the V.7.7-V.7.9 sequence below.

---

#### 10.1 (legacy sketch) Arachne (V.7.7+ — compositing-anchored, post-V.7.5 pivot)

**Hero reference:** `01_macro_dewy_web_on_dark.jpg`. If a session matches one frame, match this one. **Anti-references:** `09_anti_clipart_symmetry.jpg` (failure mode #1: clipart) and `10_anti_neon_stylized_glow.jpg` (failure mode #2: graphic-glow). The V.7.5 build still reads as a stylized 2D bullseye visually distant from the references — not because individual constants are wrong, but because the renderer is missing entire compositing layers the references depend on. (Background: D-072, M7 session `2026-05-02T01-35-34Z`.)

**Target:** nature-documentary close-up of a dewy orb-weaver web. Drops carry the visual; threads are faint connective tissue between drop chains. The world the web sits in is half the visual: atmospheric backlit haze, defocused foliage, beams of light through dust. Each drop is a tiny refractive lens distorting and inverting the background behind it (refs `03`, `04`). Pure black is the silence-calibration state only (per `08_palette_bioluminescent_organism.jpg`), not the steady-playback state.

**Architecture mandate (D-072):** This rewrite is compositional, not parametric. The V.7.5 constant-tuning pass is preserved as the v5 baseline (silk × 0.32, drop radius 0.008 UV, sag range [0.06, 0.14], pool cap 4, warm key + cool ambient, dark spider silhouette, AR gate restored, subBassThreshold 0.30) — every V.7.5 commit stays in the tree. V.7.7/V.7.8/V.7.9 add three new compositing layers around that baseline. The pre-pivot V.7.6 (atmosphere as a multiplicative-mist patch) is abandoned; that scope moves into V.7.7 with the right architectural shape. D-043's 2D SDF mandate stands.

**The reference visual signature decomposes into three layers:**

1. **A textured atmospheric world behind the web** — defocused foliage, warm-to-cool aerial perspective, optional volumetric backlight beam. Refs `01`, `03`, `04`, `05`, `06`, `07` all show this; current preset has none.
2. **Drops as refractive lenses, not glowing dots** — refs `03` and `04` show drops as spherical-cap lenses inverting the background through refraction. The "real water" optical signature is refraction + fresnel rim + sharp specular pinpoint, not emissive amber.
3. **Optical depth via DoF and chord-segment threads** — refs `01`, `03` show heavy bokeh blur falling off into the distance. Refs `04`, `08` show threads as discrete straight chord segments between attachment points, not smooth Archimedean curves. The renderer needs depth-aware blur and a chord-segment SDF replacement.

#### 10.1.A Background atmosphere pass (V.7.7)

**Per** `01_macro_dewy_web_on_dark.jpg`, `03_micro_adhesive_droplet.jpg`, `04_specular_silk_fiber_highlight.jpg`, `05_lighting_backlit_atmosphere.jpg`, `06_atmosphere_dark_misty_forest.jpg`, `07_atmosphere_dust_light_shaft.jpg`.

Render an offscreen background texture before the web pass. Compose under the web. Output is sampled by the drops (V.8.2) for refraction. Layers:

- **Mood-tinted vertical aerial-perspective gradient** — warm amber-bottom for high-valence states (ref `04` golden glow, ref `05` golden field), cool blue-grey for low-valence (ref `06` cool palette). `mix(bottomColor, topColor, saturate(uv.y * 1.2 - 0.1))` with both colors driven by valence + arousal. Pure black at silence is the explicit calibration anchor (ref `08`), not a steady-state default.
- **Defocused foliage** via `worley_fbm` at low frequency (≈ 2–4 in UV space) writing dim silhouettes into the gradient. Mottled with `fbm8` at lower amplitude for organic variation. Heavily desaturated and darkened so it reads as "out-of-focus background", not a competing subject. Apply baked-in mild Gaussian blur (3–5 px) so foliage edges are soft.
- **Optional volumetric beam** — when `f.mid_att_rel > 0.05`, render a soft directional beam from `kL` projected to UV space: additive warm tint along the beam axis with perpendicular falloff via `smoothstep(beamHalfWidth, 0, perpDist)`. Replaces the V.7-era isotropic mote field with the beam structure ref `07` actually shows.
- **Vignette** — radial darkening at the frame edges so the eye is drawn to the centered hero composition. Subtle (≈ 30 % attenuation at corners).

The bg pass is a separate render-to-texture call before `arachne_fragment`. Texture binding: a new `arachneBackgroundTexture` at fragment texture index 12 (next available after IBL slots). Resolution: half-res (`drawableSize / 2`) is fine — it's defocused anyway, and we save bandwidth. Lifetime: regenerated per frame so audio modulation lands continuously.

#### 10.1.B Drops as refractive lenses (V.7.8)

**Per** `03_micro_adhesive_droplet.jpg`, `04_specular_silk_fiber_highlight.jpg`, `01_macro_dewy_web_on_dark.jpg`.

The current drop block (V.7.5: warm-amber emissive × 0.18 + warm specular pinpoint) is replaced with a refractive-glass recipe that samples the background texture from V.8.1.

Inside the existing drop loop, where we already compute `detail_normal` (the spherical-cap normal):

```
// Refract the bg texture through the drop. Snell's law: eta = 1/IOR_water ≈ 1/1.33 ≈ 0.752.
// The cap normal points away from the water; refraction bends the view ray INTO the drop,
// producing the inverted, magnified image of the bg that refs 03/04 show.
float3 viewDir = float3(0, 0, -1);  // screen-space view
float3 refractDir = refract(viewDir, detail_normal, 0.752);
float2 refractUV = uv + refractDir.xy * dropRadius * 1.5;  // scale tuned to ref 04 magnification
float3 bgRefracted = bgTex.sample(bgSampler, refractUV).rgb;

// Fresnel rim: edges of the drop have higher reflectance, dimmer refraction.
float fresnel = pow(1.0 - saturate(dot(detail_normal, -viewDir)), 5.0);
float3 dropColor = mix(bgRefracted, float3(0.0), fresnel * 0.7);  // dark fresnel rim ring

// Specular pinpoint: tiny mirror-like highlight from kL.
float3 R = reflect(-kL, detail_normal);
float spec = pow(saturate(dot(R, -viewDir)), 96.0);  // tighter than V.7.5 (was 64)
dropColor += float3(1.00, 0.95, 0.85) * spec * 2.0;  // brighter pinpoint to read against bg

// Edge ring: dark thin ring at the drop perimeter for crisp definition.
float edgeRing = smoothstep(dropRadius - 0.001, dropRadius - 0.0005, length(d2));
dropColor *= mix(1.0, 0.4, edgeRing);
```

**Density and visual hierarchy inversion.** Bump drop spacing tighter (3–5 px instead of 4–6 px from V.7.5) so chains visibly bead-touch as in ref `01`. Drops are no longer audio-gain-modulated via emissive multiplier (the bg is what's bright now, drops show whatever the bg is doing); audio modulation moves to the bg pass intensity (warm-key beam strength scales with `f.bass_att_rel`).

**Strand emission falls further.** With drops doing the visual work, silk strands drop from V.7.5's `silkTint × 0.32` to `silkTint × 0.18` for the anchor web, `× 0.12 × w.opacity` for pool webs. They become the faint connective tissue between drop chains the references show.

#### 10.1.C Chord-segment spiral + selective DoF (V.7.9)

**Per** `04_specular_silk_fiber_highlight.jpg`, `08_palette_bioluminescent_organism.jpg`, `01_macro_dewy_web_on_dark.jpg`.

**Chord-segment spiral.** Replace the continuous Archimedean spiral SDF (`arachneEvalWeb` lines computing `theta - (rT/webR)*spirRevs*2π` then `min(fract, 1-fract)`) with discrete chord segments. For each spiral revolution N, for each pair of adjacent radials at angles θᵢ and θᵢ₊₁, place one straight line segment between the radial-attachment points at radius `r(N, θᵢ) = (N + θᵢ/(2π)) × webR / spirRevs`. Compute distance via per-segment `arachSegDist`. Visually breaks the bullseye effect because the spiral now reads as a sequence of straight chords (which is what real spiders weave) rather than a continuous curve that degenerates to rings at narrow line thickness.

Cost: `O(spokeCount × spirRevs)` segment distance evals per pixel, gated by an early-exit on radial distance to web center. At spokeCount=11–17 and spirRevs=4–8, that's 44–136 segment evals per pixel inside the web hit-box — acceptable on Tier 2; gated to Tier 1 by reducing `spirRevs` to 4.

**Selective depth-of-field.** Add a depth-weighted bokeh pass to `PostProcessChain`. Each web carries an existing `depth ∈ [0, 1]` field (already in `WebGPU` struct). Foreground anchor web (depth ≈ 0) renders sharp; pool webs at higher depth values get progressively more circular-aperture blur applied via a 9-tap disc-kernel sample in screen space. Drops on near webs stay sharp (the hero detail); distant drops blur into bokeh circles (matches refs `01`, `03`). Use the existing `noiseFBM` texture for blue-noise dither so the bokeh doesn't band.

The DoF pass runs after the web pass and before `mv_warp`. Reuses `PostProcessChain.bloomEnabled` infrastructure pattern but adds a third pipeline state for the bokeh kernel.

#### 10.1.D Audio reactivity (unchanged from V.7.5 — do NOT relitigate)

D-026 deviation primitives. Continuous: `f.bass_att_rel` (now drives bg-pass beam intensity instead of strand emissive gain). Beat accent: `0.07 * max(0, stems.drums_energy_dev)` (now subtle additive on bg warmth, since drops are no longer emissive). `f.mid_att_rel` drives bg foliage/beam contrast. Geometry static per D-020. Continuous/beat ratio ≥ 2× per CLAUDE.md rule of thumb. AR gate + sub-bass threshold for spider unchanged from V.7.5.

#### 10.1.E Spider (unchanged from V.7.5 — do NOT relitigate)

Dark silhouette `(0.04, 0.03, 0.02)` with thin warm-amber rim catching backlit `kL`. AR gate + threshold tuned per V.7.5 §10.1.9. The spider is still composited on top of the web on top of the bg.

**Budget:** ≤ 6.0 ms p95 at 1080p Tier 2 (raised from 5.5 ms to budget for the bg pass + DoF kernel). Tier 1 budget allows 7.5 ms.

**Sessions estimated:** 3 — V.7.7 covers §10.1.A (background pass). V.7.8 covers §10.1.B (refractive drops + visual hierarchy inversion). V.7.9 covers §10.1.C (chord-segment spiral + DoF) plus the cert-review eyeball. The pre-pivot V.7.6 plan (atmosphere as a multiplicative-mist patch on the existing single-pass renderer) is **abandoned** per D-072 — the bg pass in V.7.7 is the proper home for atmosphere. V.8 remains reserved for Gossamer per §10.2.

**M7 prep (mandatory final step of every V.7+ session per D-071):** Capture a single representative frame at steady mid-energy. Place it in a 2×4 contact sheet with `01`, `02`, `03`, `04`, `05`, `07`, `08`, `10`. Record pass/fail per positive reference and a "matches anti-ref?" boolean for `10`. The session is not done if the anti-ref boolean is true on `10`, regardless of automated rubric score.

### 10.2 Gossamer (V.8)

**Current state:** static SDF web with colored propagating waves. Waves are pure palette shifts, no displacement.

**Target:** singular hero web that physically resonates with sound. Waves visibly displace silk threads. Silk glows with vocal pitch color. Chromatic aberration on wave peaks.

**Uplift plan:**

1. **Macro:** 17 explicit irregular spoke angles (already in v3), off-center hub. Raise thread count on spiral (more turns, finer thread) to make the web read as an instrument not a geometry study.
2. **Meso:** physical wave displacement. Each active wave at vocal-pitch-keyed color actually offsets the silk strand position in the direction perpendicular to strand tangent, amplitude scaled by wave amplitude. Requires per-strand SDF evaluation, not uniform displacement.
3. **Micro:** silk thread material per §4.3. Same Marschner-lite as Arachne but tuned `azimuthal_r = 0.08, azimuthal_tt = 0.5, absorption = 0.3`.
4. **Specular:** fine specular glints at node intersections where strands cross. Chromatic aberration on strongest waves: RGB channels sampled at slightly offset positions for a prismatic highlight.
5. **Atmosphere:** bioluminescent ambient haze in a 0.5-radius halo around the web. Dust motes drawn inward by wave energy, outward at silence.
6. **Lighting:** scene is nearly-black. Web emission is the primary light source. SSGI picks up web emission and projects soft ambient fill onto background — very visible in a dark scene.
7. **Audio reactivity:** waves are vocal-pitch-keyed (current), but velocity of wave propagation becomes `2.0 + stems.vocals_energy_dev * 5.0` (faster waves on high vocal energy). Wave amplitude drives displacement magnitude per §10.2.2. Dust-mote inward drift velocity from `stems.vocals_energy_att`.

**Budget:** ~4.5 ms on Tier 2.

**Sessions estimated:** 2 (physical displacement rework / atmosphere + chromatic aberration).

### 10.3 Ferrofluid Ocean (V.9)

**Current state:** HDR post-process chain over simple surface. Not iconic.

**Target:** a fixed-camera, ocean-portion-scale view of a body of liquid where the water has been replaced by ferrofluid material. Underlying Gerstner swell motion moves the body up and down and back and forth with the music; the Rosensweig spike lattice emerges from the swell when bass energy is high, collapses entirely at silence. A stage rig of 4–6 animated colored lights in slow orbital motion sweeps over the surface, creating diffuse colored beam reflections that wrap across the spike geometry. Material is pitch-black with thin-film interference (`thinfilm_rgb` from `Utilities/PBR/Thin.metal`) giving highlights a subtle iridescent angular shift. Background is a sky-dome IBL cubemap tinted by D-022 mood valence; distant fog cools to dark purple per `07_*`.

**Visual references:** see `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/`. Dual hero references: `04_specular_razor_highlights.jpg` (specular character + stage-rig lighting); `01_macro_ferrofluid_at_swell_scale.jpg` (macro scale framing).

**Uplift plan:**

1. **Macro:** replace current surface with ferrofluid field per §4.6, composed on top of a Gerstner-wave macro displacement field. Base height is a sum of 4–6 superposed Gerstner waves with audio-driven amplitude (see §10.3.7); the Rosensweig spike field rides on top of that base. Gerstner is implemented preset-level per the §4.14 `mat_ocean` convention (no Gerstner utility exists in the V.1 noise tree). Hex-tile spike lattice per §4.6; spike height driven by `stems.bass_energy_dev`. The independence of swell amplitude and spike height is load-bearing per D-124(d) — both states (calm-body-with-spikes, agitated-body-without-spikes) must be reachable in the routing domain. See `01_*` for macro scale framing, `02b_*` for the swell motion geometry. Disregard `01_*`'s apparent grid regularity — see annotation.
2. **Meso:** domain-warp the spike-center positions per §3.4 so hexagonal symmetry is broken by organic flow. Flow velocity driven by `stems.drums_beat` rising edges. Excited-state ripple density per `02c_*` should read across the surface at peak energy. See `02_meso_lattice_defects.jpg` for the defect distribution.
3. **Micro:** surface-scale detail noise on each spike (fbm8 at 15× scale, normal perturbation amplitude 0.02). Micro-droplets at spike tips on high amplitude — hash-lattice distributed. See `03_*` for surface grain, `03b_*` for tip droplet behavior (Cassie-Baxter beading). `03b_*`'s lotus-leaf radial vein pattern is anti-directive per annotation.
4. **Specular:** ferrofluid material per §4.6 with anisotropic reflection aligned along spike axes; thin-film interference layer composed on top via `thinfilm_rgb` from `Utilities/PBR/Thin.metal` (tuned for cool tones — blue-to-cyan iridescent shift across viewing angle, giving highlights the "hint of blue" called out in §4.6's material comment). See `04_*` for the hero specular character. Thin-film is mandatory under the V.9 redirect per D-124(a); it fills the third-material slot vacated by caustic underlighting's removal. The §4.18 `mat_chitin` recipe is a *reference example* of `thinfilm_rgb` usage (call-site pattern at biological-strength `× 0.15`); V.9 calls `thinfilm_rgb` directly with its own parameter set.
5. **Atmosphere:** distant fog cools to dark purple per `07_atmosphere_dark_purple_fog.jpg`. Sky-dome IBL cubemap is the primary indirect light — every polished spike reflects a tiny piece of the sky. Fog tint multiplies IBL ambient per `RayMarch.metal` `iblAmbient *= scene.lightColor.rgb` so D-022 mood valence shifts visible scene-wide. Caustic underlighting is removed under the V.9 redirect per D-124(a); the `09_lighting_caustic_underglow_cyan.jpg` reference is retired.
6. **Lighting:** §5.8 stage-rig recipe (NEW under redirect, replacing §5.2 for this preset). 4–6 colored point lights orbiting slowly above the scene at moderate altitude; orbit speed routed from arousal; beam color rotation routed from `stems.vocals_pitch_hz` normalized inline and confidence-gated at ≥ 0.6 (with `stems.other_energy_dev` fallback); beam intensity routed from `stems.drums_energy_dev` envelope (not onset). At silence, lights continue orbiting at minimum intensity in a default cool palette. See `04_*` for the beam-on-ferrofluid quality (one frozen instant of the rig); see `08_lighting_aurora_over_dark_water.jpg` for the diffuse-gradient character of colored light moving over a dark reflective body at landscape scale. Anti-reference: stage rig reads as club lighting (beat-strobed beams, oversaturated party palette) — see anti-references list in the README.
7. **Audio reactivity:** see `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/ferrofluid_ocean/README.md` "Audio routing notes" for the full nine-route mapping (spike height, ripple, sharpness, rotational flow, swell amplitude, beam orbit speed, beam color, beam intensity, fog hue). All routes are D-026 deviation primitives or D-022 mood-valence; no absolute-threshold patterns; no `*_beat` rising edges except where explicitly accent-only.

**Budget:** ~7.0 ms on Tier 2 (raised from 6.0 ms under the redirect to absorb the §5.8 stage-rig multi-light evaluations and Gerstner swell additions; corresponding `complexity_cost.tier2 = 7.0` in JSON sidecar). Tier 1 may require half-res reflection + reduced beam count (3 lights at Tier 1 vs. 4–6 at Tier 2) and is profiled at implementation time.

**Sessions estimated:** 5 (Gerstner + spike field formulation / material + thin-film / stage-rig lighting recipe / audio routing / cert review).

### 10.4 ~~Fractal Tree (V.10)~~ — SUPERSEDED (FTR.1 / D-212, 2026-08-03)

> **This plan is cancelled and applies to no shipping preset.** Matt's direction (D-212): Fractal Tree **keeps its low-fidelity graphic look**; its remaining work is audio reactivity and certification, not fidelity. The painterly target below moved to **Goldengrove** (`docs/presets/GOLDENGROVE_PLAN.md`), which was scoped for that register, and the 14 curated reference images transferred with it to `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/goldengrove/`.
>
> Retained here because the §4.7 bark / §4.8 leaf / §5.6 golden-hour recipe mapping below is sound and Goldengrove builds on it — read it as *Goldengrove's* recipe list, not as work queued against Fractal Tree. For Fractal Tree's actual plan see `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` Phase FTR and `docs/presets/FRACTAL_TREE_REACTIVITY_REVIEW.md`.

**Current state:** mesh-shader procedural L-system geometry. Bare branches, no bark, no foliage, no wind.

**Target (now Goldengrove's):** painterly tree in seasonal palette, bark with real displacement, translucent leaves, wind-driven motion.

**Uplift plan (now Goldengrove's):**

1. **Macro:** L-system tree generation stays. Increase branching depth by 1 level on Tier 2 for visual density.
2. **Meso:** bark displacement via POM per §8.3 using a generated heightmap (procedural from `ridged_mf`). Branch thickness varies per segment via `fbm8` rather than strict L-system prescription.
3. **Micro:** bark material per §4.7 — lichen patches, vertical fiber ridges, triplanar detail normal.
4. **Specular:** roughness variation along bark via `fbm8`. Wet-bark mode (controllable by JSON) for rain-slick appearance.
5. **Atmosphere:** ground fog at low altitude. Aerial perspective on distant branches (color desaturation with depth).
6. **Lighting:** golden-hour per §5.6. Leaves receive strong back-lit SSS from key light. Shadows cast between branches via shadow-map sampling.
7. **Foliage:** NEW — add procedural leaf clusters at branch tips. Each cluster is a billboarded quad with leaf material (§4.8). 200–500 leaves per tree on Tier 2.
8. **Wind animation:** per-branch offset driven by `curl_noise(wp + time)`. Leaves sway more than branches (greater amplitude at higher L-system depth). Tie gust intensity to `stems.other_energy_att`.
9. **Seasonal palette:** JSON toggle among `spring` (green + pink blossoms), `summer` (deep green), `autumn` (orange/red), `winter` (bare + frost). Default autumn. Sync with valence: negative valence → winter, positive → spring/summer.

**Budget:** ~6.5 ms on Tier 2 (POM on bark + many leaves).

**Sessions estimated:** 4 (bark material + POM / foliage / wind animation / seasonal palette + audio routing).

### 10.5 Volumetric Lithograph (V.11)

**Current state:** fBM heightfield terrain, bimodal materials, IQ cosine palette. Has been iterated 6+ times. Lacks topographic conviction — reads as lumpy rather than mountainous.

**Target:** mountainous landscape with aerial perspective and drifting cloud shadows. Linocut aesthetic but with real depth.

**Uplift plan:**

1. **Macro:** replace current fBM heightfield with `ridged_mf` per §3.3 warped by `curl_noise` for drainage flow. Terrain reads as eroded mountainous range, not lumps.
2. **Meso:** secondary displacement layer adds mesa terraces via `step(frac(h * 8.0), 0.5) * 0.05`. Optional — selectable per-variant for geological theme.
3. **Micro:** triplanar detail normal per §8.2 at 30× scale. Kills stretched texels on steep faces.
4. **Specular:** keep current bimodal peak/valley materials. Add specular variation via second fBM — prevents metallic peaks from reading as uniform chrome.
5. **Atmosphere:** NEW — aerial perspective fog. Color-shift fog `lerp(warm_sky, cool_depth, depth_factor)`. Distant peaks desaturate and brighten toward sky color. This single addition would transform the preset.
6. **Lighting:** keep current single-directional + IBL. Raise IBL contribution on distant geometry via screen-space AO falloff. Add long shadows via shadow-map or simple dot-ratio term for pseudo-occlusion.
7. **Clouds (optional):** drifting cloud shadows cast onto terrain via screen-space density sample. Low-cost — sample `fbm8(wp.xz + time * 0.02)` as scalar multiplier on key light intensity.
8. **Beat reactive:** replace palette flash on beat with "cutting-plane reveal" — a plane sweeps across the terrain from one direction, momentarily rendering crossed regions in inverted palette. Reads as "ink printing" motion.
9. **Audio reactivity:** terrain scrolls audio-time-swept per current. Add pitch-color modulation per current MV-3c. Add beat cutting-plane reveal per §10.5.8.

**Budget:** ~5.0 ms on Tier 2.

**Sessions estimated:** 3 (terrain reformulation with ridged_mf + curl warp / aerial perspective + clouds / cutting-plane beat + audio polish).

## 11. Infrastructure Changes

### 11.1 SwiftLint `file_length` exception for `.metal`

Current rule: 400 lines. Good shaders run 800–2000. `.swiftlint.yml` gets a path-based exception:

```yaml
included:
  - UzumeEngine/Sources
excluded:
  - "**/Shaders/**/*.metal"

# Alternative: keep lint but raise threshold for .metal
file_length:
  warning: 400
  error: 1000
  ignore_comment_only_lines: true
```

(Exact mechanism depends on SwiftLint's support for per-glob config — may require a separate `.swiftlint-metal.yml` run on `.metal` files only. To be decided in Increment V.1 implementation.)

### 11.2 Utility library directory tree

From the improvement plan Increment V.1–V.3:

### 11.3 Material cookbook as a Metal header

Each material recipe from §4 ships as a function in `Shaders/Utilities/Materials/`:

```
Materials/
  Metals.metal       → mat_polished_chrome, mat_brushed_aluminum, mat_gold, mat_copper, mat_ferrofluid
  Dielectrics.metal  → mat_ceramic, mat_frosted_glass, mat_wet_stone
  Organic.metal      → mat_bark, mat_leaf, mat_silk_thread, mat_chitin
  Exotic.metal       → mat_ocean, mat_ink, mat_marble, mat_granite
```

Presets compose these by calling material functions directly from `sceneMaterial()`.

## 12. The Fidelity Rubric

Every preset must pass this rubric before certification (Increment V.6). Replaces the weak invariants in Increment 5.2.

### 12.1 Mandatory (fail any → not certified)

- [ ] **Detail cascade present.** All four scales (macro / meso / micro / specular breakup) implemented on every primary surface.
- [ ] **Minimum 4 noise octaves.** Somewhere in the shader. Single-octave-fBM presets fail.
- [ ] **Minimum 3 distinct materials.** Constant-material presets fail. Plasma-family presets exempt (explicitly stylized).
- [ ] **Audio-responsive through deviation primitives.** Uses `f.bass_rel/dev`, `f.mid_rel/dev`, etc. per D-026. Absolute-threshold presets fail.
- [ ] **Graceful silence fallback.** Non-black and non-static at `totalStemEnergy == 0`.
- [ ] **Performance within tier budget.** p95 frame time ≤ tier budget at 1080p.
- [ ] **Matt-approved reference frame match.** Visual regression compared against Matt-annotated reference images; Matt signs off.

### 12.2 Expected (≥ 2 of 4)

- [ ] Triplanar texturing on all non-planar surfaces
- [ ] Detail normals
- [ ] Volumetric fog or aerial perspective
- [ ] Subsurface scattering, fiber BRDF, or anisotropic specular on at least one material

### 12.3 Strongly preferred (≥ 1 of 4)

- [ ] Hero specular highlight visible in ≥60% of frames
- [ ] Parallax occlusion mapping on at least one surface
- [ ] Volumetric light shafts or dust motes
- [ ] Chromatic aberration or thin-film interference on at least one material

### 12.4 Rubric score

- Mandatory 7/7 required.
- Expected ≥ 2/4 required.
- Strongly preferred ≥ 1/4 required.

Minimum score: **10/15** with all mandatory items. Falling short on any mandatory = not certified regardless of optional score.

Uncertified presets exist in the catalog but the Orchestrator excludes them from session planning by default. A "show uncertified presets" toggle in `SettingsView` exists for testing but is off by default.

### 12.5 Certification pipeline (Increment V.6)

The rubric is enforced by `DefaultFidelityRubric` in `Sources/Presets/Certification/FidelityRubric.swift`. It evaluates each preset's Metal source and JSON sidecar statically and surfaces failures in `RubricResult`. `PresetCertificationStore` (actor) caches results for all production presets.

**To read the current rubric report for all presets:**

```bash
swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter "FidelityRubricReportTests/rubricReport_allPresetsLoad" 2>&1 | grep -A 3 "\[✓\]\|\[✗\]"
```

**To certify a preset** after a fidelity uplift session:

1. Verify `meetsAutomatedGate == true` in the rubric report (Suite 1 output above).
2. Review the preset against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/README.md` reference images.
3. Set `"certified": true` in the preset's JSON sidecar.
4. Run `swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter FidelityRubricTests` — Suite 2 gate dict must be updated (change `false → true` for the newly certified preset).

**Lightweight presets** (Plasma, Waveform, Nebula, SpectralCartograph) use a 4-item ladder (L1–L4) instead of the full 15. Add `"rubric_profile": "lightweight"` to the sidecar. Detail-cascade and material-count requirements are waived for stylized 2D / diagnostic presets. See D-067(b).

**`rubric_hints`** allows authors to assert P1 (hero specular) and P3 (dust motes) when the static analyzer cannot detect them from function names alone. Add `"rubric_hints": {"hero_specular": true, "dust_motes": false}` to the sidecar. The hints do not affect M1–M6 or the mandatory gate.

### 12.6 Substantial-similarity discipline rule (Milkdrop-inspired presets only)

**Applies to:** any Uzume preset that carries an `inspired_by`
provenance block in its JSON sidecar (per D-111 amendment). Filed as
D-116 and operative under the inspired-by reframe (D-113 /
`docs/MILKDROP_STRATEGY.md` §12.5). Does **not** apply to
Uzume-native presets (Aurora Veil, Crystalline Cavern, the Phase
G-uplift catalog members) — those are unaffected.

**Why it exists.** "Inspired by" is a framing label, not a legal
shield. Substantive similarity is a content test, not a metadata
test. A Uzume preset that names a Milkdrop source as inspiration
in its JSON sidecar but reproduces the source's specific protectable
expression — its shader logic, its per-frame equation surface, its
visual structure — does not become a new work by virtue of the
`inspired_by` block. The discipline rule operationalizes the
inspired-by framing **as an authoring-time constraint**, parallel to
Failed Approach #48 ("§10.1-faithful but reference-divergent visual
outputs") which surfaced the parallel failure mode at M7 review
time.

**The rule.**

1. **No source equations copy-pasted into Uzume shader code.**
   The author reads the `.milk` file end-to-end to understand the
   aesthetic intent and the audio-coupling fingerprint; the
   Uzume `.metal` is written from scratch against Uzume's
   primitives (V.1–V.4 utilities, mv\_warp, ray\_march, MV-3
   capabilities). Re-expressing the source's idea in Uzume-
   native code is the work; mechanically transposing the source's
   code into Metal syntax is not.

2. **No source shader logic ported line-for-line.** Where the source
   `.milk` carries HLSL `warp_1=…warp_NN=` blocks, the Uzume
   equivalent is authored against `mv_warp` / `mvWarpPerVertex`,
   not by mechanically translating the HLSL surface. The *shape* of
   the motion may resemble the source's; the *implementation* is
   Uzume-native. The same applies to per-pixel-grid expressions
   in the source's `per_pixel_NN` blocks — those are aesthetic
   reference, not transpiler input.

3. **The Uzume preset's rendered output must differ measurably
   from the source on at least one of: dominant motion model,
   palette character, primary feature stack, or compositional
   structure.** *(Strengthened by D-121; originally permissive.)*
   "May differ" was the original framing and proved too weak — code-
   side discipline (bullets 1 / 2 / 4) doesn't prevent producing
   visually-identical output from differently-written code. Bullet 3
   closes the rendered-output substantive-similarity axis where
   copyright in visual works actually lives.

   - **Dominant motion model** — the source's primary motion source
     (per-vertex feedback warp / particle swarm / camera flight /
     SDF march / time-modulation) maps onto a different motion source
     in the Uzume preset. Honoring concept while changing the
     mechanism is the canonical example.
   - **Palette character** — the source's hue / saturation / value
     distribution diverges meaningfully from the Uzume preset's.
     "Same colours, different motion" doesn't pass on this axis;
     "Different colours, same motion" does.
   - **Primary feature stack** — the load-bearing visual features
     differ (the source's hero element is a kaleidoscope mirror
     plane; the Uzume preset's hero element is something else
     reachable from the same concept).
   - **Compositional structure** — frame composition (radial vs grid
     vs free-flow), foreground / background relationship, viewport
     framing.

   Faithful structural reproduction is not a virtue under inspired-by;
   honoring the source's *intent* in Uzume's voice is. A preset
   that cannot articulate divergence on at least one axis is by
   definition reproducing the source's expression, even if its code
   shares zero lines with the source.

4. **Source `.milk` files are not redistributed.** They are read
   from a developer-local checkout of the cream-of-crop pack; the
   pack stays at its source URL. Uzume ships only the new
   Uzume-native creations (`.metal` + `.json`) that took the
   `.milk` files as inspiration. No `.milk` content goes into the
   Uzume repository, the Uzume binary, or any redistributed
   artifact.

**M7 review checklist (Milkdrop-inspired presets only).** Each
inspired-by preset's M7 review explicitly checks each of the four
bullets above against the source `.milk`. A preset that fails any
bullet does **not** certify. The remediation is to rewrite from
scratch under closer discipline — not to tune the existing output
toward divergence from the source. Failed Approach #49 ("tuning
constants on a structurally broken renderer") is the precedent: at
this scale the failure is structural, not parametric.

**Mandatory side-by-side render test (D-121).** As part of M7 review:

1. Render the Uzume preset on a chosen test track at 1920×1080
   (use the standard `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --filter
   PresetVisualReview` harness or a representative live-music
   capture from `~/Documents/uzume_sessions/<timestamp>/`).
2. Render the source `.milk` on the same test track in projectM
   (or a comparable Milkdrop-compatible renderer) at the same
   resolution.
3. Place the two renders side-by-side in the M7 review artefact.
4. M7 reviewer (Matt) writes a **one-paragraph divergence
   rationale** in the preset's closeout, naming **which of the
   four bullet-3 axes diverges and how**.

If the reviewer cannot articulate a divergence on at least one
axis, the preset does not certify. The remediation is **rewrite
under closer discipline**, not "tune until visually distinct enough"
— the latter is the Failed Approach #49 pattern at the
substantive-similarity level.

**Worked examples (illustrative, not normative).**

* *OK*: Reading Geiss — *3D - Luz* end-to-end to understand its
  particle-nova aesthetic + audio coupling fingerprint, then
  authoring a new Uzume preset using `mv_warp` + a Uzume-
  native particle-render path + V.3 palette utilities. The
  Uzume preset's particle count, dispersion model, palette
  generation, and audio routing are all Uzume-native; the
  *concept* (a radiating particle nova that breathes with bass) is
  the inspiration. The `inspired_by` block names Geiss *3D - Luz*;
  the M7 review checks that the Uzume preset's shader contains
  no recognizable Geiss equations or structural patterns.
* *Not OK*: Reading the same Geiss source, hand-transposing each
  of its `per_pixel_NN` equations into Metal syntax, wrapping the
  resulting per-vertex math in an `mvWarpPerVertex` body, and
  labeling the result as `inspired_by`. The labeling is wrong; the
  preset is a manual port. Substantial similarity is high; the
  inspired-by framing fails.
* *Edge case*: A source preset's audio coupling — say, "bass
  squared drives radial expansion exponent" — is a small,
  general-purpose mathematical relationship reasonably found in
  any radial-expansion shader. Re-using *the same relationship*
  in a Uzume-native uplift is OK; substantial similarity is
  about specific protectable expression, not about general
  mathematical patterns. The M7 review applies common sense here;
  document the call in the preset closeout if it's marginal.

### 12.7 Pale-tone-share ceiling (palette-driven presets only)

**Applies to:** any Uzume preset whose primary colour source is a
discrete per-cell, per-shard, per-tile, or per-particle palette
register — Lumen Mosaic (LM.4.7+) is the load-bearing consumer.
**Does not apply to** continuous-colour presets (ray-march scenes,
fluid simulations, plasma-family) — their colour discipline lives in
the §4 material cookbook (per-recipe saturation and roughness) and
in §5 lighting recipes, not in this gate.

**Rule.** Per non-silence fixture frame, classify each cell / shard /
tile / particle by its linear RGB. A sample is **pale** if
`min(R, G, B) > 0.65` — that is, every channel is in the upper third
of the [0, 1] range (cream, ivory, pearl, bone, pale-pink,
pale-azure, pale-mint, pale-anything). A fixture is **rejected** if
`pale_sample_count / total_samples > 0.30`. The ceiling is a hard
floor on cert; soft scoring (e.g. "pale-share weighted into the
orchestrator") is not an acceptable substitute because the LM.2
cream-haze failure mode tolerates a lot of bad-tie-breaker margin.

**Why this exists.** The categorical "no muted / pastel / cream-haze
palettes" rule that landed after the 2026-05-09 LM.2 verdict
foreclosed every stained-glass / porcelain / miniature / Cycladic
palette. D-LM-cream-rescission replaces the categorical rule with
this compositional ceiling: cream-as-accent against saturated ground
is permitted; cream-as-dominant-surface is not. The 30 % threshold
is calibrated against Cathedral Lights (4 of 12 palette entries pale
→ ~33 % palette pale-share → ~25 % nominal panel pale-share with
margin for hash-draw variance up to ~30 %).

**The compositional distinction (load-bearing for future preset
authors).**

- **Pale as structural highlight = permitted.** The visual language
  is *"deep jewel tones interrupted by points of cream-coloured
  light"* — stained-glass, Ming porcelain, Persian miniature,
  Cycladic at the pale-rich end. Pale cells read as
  light-through-glass or pearlescent highlights against the
  saturated ground; total share stays under 30 %.
- **Pale as dominant surface = rejected.** A panel where the eye
  reads "this is mostly cream/pale with some colour" is the LM.2
  failure mode. Mood-tint formulas of the form
  `mix(cream, hue, sat)` that pull every cell toward a desaturated
  baseline are the canonical anti-pattern; they remain forbidden as
  a shader-authoring shape even if the resulting panel happens to
  stay under 30 % pale on a specific track (the form is wrong; the
  per-track pale-share is downstream luck).

**Relationship to §12.1.** The pale-tone-share ceiling is **not**
in the §12.1 universal-mandatory list — it applies conditionally to
palette-driven presets and is a no-op for the ray-march /
fluid-sim / plasma majority. It is treated as a mandatory gate
**for the presets in scope** rather than a globally-mandatory item.

**Carry-forward.** The gate's mechanical implementation lands at
`LumenPaletteSpectrumTests` (or wherever the LM.9 cert gate set
lives in code) per Increment LM.4.7. Future palette-driven presets
inherit the gate at their own cert sweep — they do not get a free
pass because the gate is "for Lumen Mosaic." Filed as
D-LM-cream-rescission; the parent palette-library architecture is
D-LM-palette-library.

## 13. Failed Approaches (Shader-Specific)

Consolidated from observed preset iterations. Additive to `CLAUDE.md §Failed Approaches`.

**35. Single-octave noise for hero surfaces.** Every preset using 1–3 octaves of Perlin/fBM reads as primitive. Minimum 4 octaves. Minimum 8 octaves for hero geometry.

**36. Uniform-albedo-per-material presets.** Constant `float3 albedo` anywhere on a hero surface. Real surfaces have per-point variation. Drive albedo through `fbm8` or `worley_fbm` at minimum.

**37. Normal-map-only pretending to be displacement.** A flat surface with a fancy normal map looks flat from any grazing angle. If the surface should have real depth perception (concrete, bark, stone), use POM, not just normal mapping.

**38. Roughness constants.** `roughness = 0.3` reads as CGI-plastic. Vary roughness spatially via noise. Even 10% variation breaks the plastic look.

**39. Grey fog.** Fog color matching sky/horizon color is atmosphere. Grey fog is a printing defect. Always match fog to scene palette.

**40. Authoring without reference images.** Every preset iteration before Phase V was authored from prose description alone. Observed output: primitive. Reference-image-first authoring is mandatory per §2.3.

**41. Ray-march scene without any atmosphere.** A ray-march scene with fog disabled and no volumetric elements reads as "floating in void." Every ray-march preset should have at minimum exponential fog matched to palette.

**42. Cylinder-as-silk / cube-as-rock / sphere-as-organic.** SDF primitives are building blocks, not final forms. Always apply at least one modifier (displacement, twist, noise-driven deformation) before materials.

**43. Skipping `mv_warp` on static-camera direct-fragment presets.** Direct-fragment presets without temporal feedback show only instantaneous audio state. Motion feels mechanical. Add `mv_warp` unless D-029 camera-dolly / particle-system constraints apply.

**44. Mesh-shader presets without per-instance variation.** L-system fractals, particle swarms, procedural structures — if every instance is identical, the preset reads as clone-stamped. Per-instance hash-driven jitter is mandatory.

**45. Four-color palette presets with uniform saturation.** Saturation pushes to the eye as "cartoon." Real palettes have saturation variation (some near-white, some deep, some near-black). Use IQ cosine palette families with per-sample saturation modulation. **Compositional ceiling (per D-LM-cream-rescission / §12.7):** the "some near-white" share is bounded — pale samples (linear RGB `min(R, G, B) > 0.65`) must remain ≤ 30 % of the panel for palette-driven presets, even when the per-sample saturation modulation produces healthy variation. Pale as structural highlight is permitted; pale as dominant ground reproduces the LM.2 cream-haze failure mode and is rejected at cert.

**46. Shader code written top-to-bottom without the coarse-to-fine pass structure.** Observed pattern: a single fragment shader tries to do everything. Observed result: debugging is impossible because all layers are interdependent. Pass structure per §2.2 makes each iteration targeted.

**47. Skipping mood-palette application at the IBL ambient level.** Per D-022, mood shifts must tint IBL ambient, not just direct light. Presets that tint only `lightColor.rgb` show mood changes only on direct-lit surfaces. Multiply IBL by `lightColor.rgb` so the shift propagates.

**48. Shipping a preset whose primary visual subject has no musical role.** Drift Motes (DM.0 → DM.3.3.1, retired in D-102) had a clear visual concept (drifting particles + god-ray light shaft) and three audio coupling points (`f.mid_att_rel` shaft breathing + emission-rate scaling + drum dispersion shock). None of those couplings produced a moment a listener would point at and say "that's the song." Five remediation increments shipped tuning changes (palette, distribution, shaft brightness, atmospheric character, spawn-Y geometry) — each landed mechanically green, none changed the fact that the visual subject had no load-bearing musical role. Failed Approach #49 (tuning constants on a structurally broken renderer) replayed at the *concept* level. The §2.0 concept-viability gate exists to catch this before authoring starts.

**49. Iterating on tuning constants when the concept is broken.** Sibling of #48 and direct extension of CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #49 (constant-tuning on a renderer structurally missing layers). If the one-sentence musical role (§2.0 Gate 1) is absent, no calibration pass converges. After every M7 round, write one sentence describing *what you now believe about why this preset is failing*; if that sentence doesn't change between rounds, the iteration is mechanical and you have re-played #48. Stop and re-scope; do not start the next remediation increment.

**50. "Reusable infrastructure" as a defense for retaining failed-concept code.** When a preset's concept doesn't work, the implementation does not earn preservation as "kernel waiting for the right concept." Per D-097 (siblings, not subclasses), future particle / mesh / ray-march presets ship their own conformer + shader file; they do not branch from a deleted preset's code. The Drift Motes `motes_update` kernel was specific (force-field motion + age recycle + per-particle hue bake) — it could not host an unrelated successor concept without rewrite. If "infrastructure" appears in a defense of keeping code whose concept was rejected, the defense is wrong.

**51. Raising the emissive level to fix an emissive element that reads too dim.** Measured on Witchlight WL.2-g, whose beaded ribbon carried 9× less light than its source. Near-doubling the bead's emissive level moved the ribbon's above-threshold pixel share from 0.405 % to 0.421 % — effectively nothing — because an age/alpha envelope (`wl_age_alpha`) scales the *whole* sprite: extra level saturates the bright end into a uniform white tube (anti-`11`) while the faded end stays under threshold regardless. **The lever is reach, not level.** Expanding the glow's screen footprint moved the same number 0.421 % → 0.777 % in one pass. Diagnostic: if the element already clips to white anywhere, level is exhausted and further level changes only widen the clipped region.

**52. A hue-carrying glow expected to cross a luminance threshold on hue alone.** An emissive element coloured at constant S/V has a Rec.601 luma that varies ~2.3× around the hue circle (at S 0.80 / V 1.0: 0.29 for violet/blue, 0.67 for yellow-green). Multiplying that hue by a radial profile leaves the cool half of the circle permanently darker than the warm half — so a preset whose hue encodes information renders half its states too dim to read, and no amount of profile tuning fixes it because the deficit is in the colour. Mix the glow toward a cool white *before* scaling: it buys luminance at every hue while keeping hue legible, and it is what reference cross-sections of real glowing lines actually show (a hot near-white core inside a cooler, wider, hue-carrying halo — `08` in the Witchlight set). Corollary: the whiteness lift has an upper bound set by hue legibility, not by luminance — Witchlight measured 0.44 washing the stroke to neutral for no gain over 0.34.

**53. Core and halo sharing one sprite quad.** If a two-part radial profile is evaluated inside a quad sized to the element, the halo cannot be wider than the element by construction, and `discard_fragment` at the quad edge turns any halo bright enough to see into a hard-edged disc. Size the quad to the *halo* and rescale the core's radial term by the same factor so the core stays pinned to the element's real size — the element does not get bigger, its glow gets the reach the reference shows. For elements emitted along a path this is also what closes the gaps between them: overlapping halos merge a row of dots into a continuous thread, which level can never do because the gaps contain no geometry to light. Watch the interaction with additive blending — once halos overlap, the per-element level that reads correctly in isolation sums into a uniform tube, so the core/halo split has to be set against the *overlapped* result, not a single sprite.

**54. Curating an inspiration source's character from stills when the source is a living preset.** Witchlight's whole reference set, design doc and three fix increments were built from two stills of its source; the source's own `.gif` sat unwatched in the same directory until the second M7 came back "does not resemble the original in look **and motion**." Watching it inverted a load-bearing conclusion: the frame-filling flare that had been filed as an *anti-reference* ("roughly a fifth of sampled frames", i.e. read as a fault rate) is in motion the source's **signature** — it swings 1.04 % → 34.41 % lit, 33×, near-black then detonation, continuously. The still chosen as the register anchor was a mid-activity frame, so it was mistaken for the resting state and set our floor ~7× too high, flattening our range to 1.3×. **A still cannot distinguish a preset's signature from its worst moment, and it cannot show dynamic range at all** — which is most of what makes a music visualiser recognisable. Before curating a reference set from an animated source, extract its frames and measure the frame-statistic *range* across them, not just one frame's values. Sibling of #40 (authoring without reference images): having references is not the same as having the right kind.

**55. A gate whose metric improves as the defect worsens.** The worst kind, because it converts a regression into evidence of success. Witchlight's `ribbonShare` counts lit pixels to prove the stroke carries light; when a later increment widened the drawn sprite past the bead spacing, consecutive sprites overlapped 30–48 % and fused into anti-reference `11`'s uniform glow tube — and the metric **doubled** (0.687 % separated → 1.636 % fused), because overlapping sprites light more pixels. Two increments shipped and one live M7 passed with the gate green and getting greener. **When you add a gate, evaluate it in the direction of the defect, not only in the direction of the fix**: render the failure mode deliberately and confirm the number moves the way you claim. If a plausible failure makes it improve, the metric is measuring the wrong thing and needs a structural companion — here, counting connected bright components, which cannot be satisfied by merging.

**56. A spacing constant calibrated against an element's size, when a later increment changes the drawn size.** Witchlight set bead spacing to `1.2 × 2 × baseRadius` — 1.2 diameters, measured against the *bare* bead. Two increments later the sprite was drawn at 2.6× then 3.2× that radius to give the halo reach, and the spacing was never revisited, so the beads fused by construction. The calibration was still *documented* accurately; it had simply stopped describing what was on screen. **Any constant derived from another quantity has to be re-derived when that quantity moves** — and a spacing rule expressed in units of a size that later gained a multiplier is the specific shape to watch for. The durable fix is to make the relationship explicit in code or in a gate (beads read as separate only while `halo_extent < 1.2 × viewScale`), so the coupling fails loudly rather than silently.

**57. Re-scoping a generator because its output looks wrong, without first checking that the output is being DISPLAYED faithfully.** Witchlight's stroke read as the same shape on every track through three consecutive M7s. A mechanism-level cause was diagnosed, written into the engineering plan as an open decision, and left parked for weeks: `θ ≈ k·φ̄`, the heading is pinned, the motion model needs re-scoping. It was wrong. The generator was fine — the *presentation* stage was destroying its output. An unbounded `tumbleYaw` turned the drawing plane edge-on every ~57 s, and near edge-on every figure projects to the same diagonal line. **One probe settled it in six minutes after three hypotheses had died in analysis: disable the presentation transforms and re-render.** Three obviously different legible figures came out of the identical motion model. When output looks degenerate, the cheapest decisive test is to strip the display path — camera, projection, warp, post — and look at the raw thing, BEFORE theorising about the generator. Corollary on why it hid so long: the defect was unbounded *growth*, and every fixture is ~21 s, at which point the yaw was only 66° — bad but not obviously fatal. **A bound that is violated only after minutes cannot be caught by a suite whose longest case is seconds; assert invariants over a span longer than any real session, not over the test's own horizon.**

### Relocated from CLAUDE.md §Failed Approaches (DOC.4, 2026-06-11)

**CLAUDE.md #34 — `abs(fract(x) − 0.5)` as an SDF fold for periodic structures (spiral threads, ring bands).** This formula gives 0 at integer positions (in the GAPS between threads) and 0.5 at half-integer positions (ON the threads). It is the inverse of a correct distance field — coverage computed from it is maximal everywhere threads are NOT, filling the entire area instead of drawing thin strands. Use `min(fract(x), 1 − fract(x))` which correctly gives 0 ON the thread and 0.5 in the gaps. Bit both Arachne and Gossamer during Increment 3.5.10/3.5.11 and caused both to render as filled discs. The visual tells: perfectly uniform lit region where web should be, no strand structure visible.

> Moved here 2026-06-11 (DOC.4): a shader-math gotcha of the same class as #42–#44 below — it prevents bugs during 3D/SDF preset authoring, where this handbook is mandatory reading.

**Mapping note (DOC.4):** CLAUDE.md #35 (single-octave noise), #36 (uniform albedo), #37 (constant roughness), #38 (grey fog), and #40 (unmodified SDF primitives) were near-verbatim duplicates of this section's own #35, #36, #38, #39, and #42 respectively; the CLAUDE.md copies were retired 2026-06-11 (DOC.4) and the §13 entries above are now the canonical text. Cross-references to "CLAUDE.md Failed Approach #35–#38/#40" resolve to those §13 entries.

### Relocated from CLAUDE.md §Failed Approaches (DOC.3b, 2026-05-13)

These three entries are calibration / language gotchas relocated from CLAUDE.md so the shader-specific lessons live with the rest of the shader handbook. Original CLAUDE.md numbering preserved for cross-reference; the §13 #42–#50 numbering above is an independent stream.

**CLAUDE.md #42 — Using `[0, 1]` smoothstep thresholds against raw `fbm8` output.** `fbm8` (and `fbm4`, `fbm12`) in the V.1 Noise tree returns values centered near 0, not 0.5. Practical range on unit-sphere positions at frequency scale ≥ 3 is approximately `[-0.7, 0.7]`. Smoothstep windows like `smoothstep(0.48, 0.52, fbm8(...))` almost always return 0 because the noise centroid is 0, not 0.48. Observed in V.3 marble, copper, and granite recipes during initial calibration. Fix: centre thresholds at 0 (`smoothstep(-0.05, 0.05, v)`) or remap first (`v * 0.5 + 0.5`). `worley_fbm` mixes `fbm8` (~`[-0.7, 0.7]`) with Worley F1 (~`[0, 0.4]`), giving effective range `[-0.65, 0.79]` centred near 0.07 — calibrate thresholds accordingly.

**CLAUDE.md #43 — Sampling `fbm8` at scale 1 on unit-sphere positions.** Fibonacci-lattice sphere positions at radius 1 land near integer Perlin lattice points (where all gradient dot-products approach 0). `fbm8(wp)` for points on the unit sphere has std dev ≈ 0.05 — far below the `[-0.7, 0.7]` theoretical range. Use scale ≥ 3 (preferably 5–10) to resolve sphere positions into regions with meaningful noise variation. Observed in V.3 granite roughness test where `fbm8(wp)` gave variance ≈ 0 for all 32 Fibonacci sphere positions.

**CLAUDE.md #44 — Using `half` as a Metal variable name.** `half` is a reserved built-in float type in Metal C++. `int half = spokeCount / 2;` silently shadows the type and causes a compilation error. The shader fails to compile with no stderr output visible during Swift test runs — the preset is simply dropped from `PresetLoader`'s fixture and the regression tests pass trivially (reporting 0 failures because the golden hash entry is never reached). Rename any variable that collides with Metal built-in types: `half`, `ushort`, `uchar`, `packed_float3`, etc. Discovered in V.7 Session 1 Arachne rewrite; fixed by renaming to `halfN`. **Note (QR.3, 2026-05-07):** `PresetLoaderCompileFailureTest` now catches this category at test time by asserting `loader.presets.count == expectedProductionPresetCount` (15). A drop without a corresponding `expectedProductionPresetCount` bump + `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry trips the test. The Failed Approach entry stays as a cautionary note for the future, but the silent-drop behaviour is no longer invisible.

## 14. Authoring Cheat Sheet (for Session Prompts)

Condensed checklist for Claude Code sessions writing a new preset. Paste into session prompts.

```
PRE-AUTHORING GATE — before opening a .metal file (§2.0):

[ ] One-sentence musical role written, naming a specific musical feature
    AND a specific visual behaviour paired with it. ("Reactive to energy"
    / "vibe with the music" do not count.)
[ ] Iconic visual subject deliverable at fidelity — comparable past
    preset cited. If Matt has flagged a fidelity gap on a similar
    preset, default to "I cannot deliver this" until proven otherwise.
[ ] Infrastructure-feasible — does not require render passes / GPU
    contracts Uzume lacks (or Matt has approved adding them).

If any pre-authoring gate fails, STOP. Bring the gap to Matt before
scoping the increment. See §2.0 and Failed Approaches #48–#50.

SESSION CHECKLIST — before declaring complete:

[ ] Read docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/README.md and all reference images.
[ ] Listed four detail-cascade layers before writing code.
[ ] Coarse-to-fine implementation order (macro → meso → micro → specular →
    atmosphere → lighting → audio).
[ ] Minimum 4 octaves of noise in hero surface.
[ ] Minimum 3 distinct materials via cookbook recipes.
[ ] Triplanar projection on non-planar surfaces.
[ ] Atmosphere present (fog, aerial perspective, volumetric element).
[ ] Detail normals or POM on primary surface.
[ ] Audio reactivity via primitives VERIFIED ALIVE on the target music
    (§14.1). Prefer signed f.*_rel + spectral_flux + beat fields; the
    positive-only f.*_dev clamps are structurally near-dead for any band
    that isn't dominant (BUG-027). Verify with a stddev measurement on a
    real session, not by trusting the primitive's name.
[ ] Graceful silence fallback tested.
[ ] Performance measured against tier budget.
[ ] Hashed reference frame comparison passed.
[ ] Matt review requested.

POST-M7 INTEGRATION (after every M7 review round):

[ ] Wrote one sentence describing what I now believe about why this
    preset is failing. If the sentence didn't change between the
    previous round and this one, the iteration is mechanical (Failed
    Approach #49). STOP, re-scope, do not start the next remediation
    increment.
```

### 14.1 Signal liveness — drive motion only from primitives that actually vary on your music

**Promoted from the Dragon Bloom 2026-06-02 re-tune.** A preset reads audio
primitives and maps them to visual motion. The trap: a primitive can be
*named* the canonical driver (D-026 calls the deviation primitives "the
primary above-average motion driver") and still be **near-dead** for the
music you're targeting — producing a preset that looks reactive in your head
and static on screen.

**What went wrong on Dragon Bloom.** Spike 1 drove feather flow from
`f.mid_att_rel` and breathing from `max(0, f.bass_att_rel)`. On bass-dominant
music both sit at ≈ 0 frame after frame (mid energy is tiny; the clamped
positive deviation almost never fired — see BUG-027, **resolved 2026-06-06**
by the per-band EMA pivot; the liveness lesson here still stands). The feathers
were frozen and the bloom didn't breathe — on **both** LF and Spotify. It read as
"barely reactive."

**The rule.** Before routing a primitive to a visual layer, **measure its
frame-to-frame standard deviation on a real recorded session of the target
music** (the `features.csv` / `stems.csv` a session writes). Drive motion only
from primitives that are *alive* (meaningful stddev) on the capture paths you
ship. A worked measurement from the Dragon Bloom diagnosis (stddev, Spotify /
LF, on bass-dominant tracks):

| Primitive | stddev | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `f.bass_rel` **(signed)** | 0.20 / 0.22 | alive + path-consistent — best continuous driver |
| `f.beat_composite` | 0.25 / 0.37 | alive accent |
| `f.spectral_flux` | 0.22 / 0.15 | alive (means differ — drive from variation, don't threshold absolutely) |
| `f.bass` (Layer-1) | 0.10 / 0.11 | solid continuous loudness |
| `f.mid`, `f.treble` | < 0.02 | **near-dead** on bass-dominant music (absolute Layer-1 values) |
| `f.bass_dev` (= `max(0, bass_rel)`) | fires ~40-50 % (post AGC2/D-146) | **alive** — per-band EMA pivot fixed it; ≈ 0 pre-2026-06-06 (BUG-027) |

**Practical guidance:**
- **`f.*_dev` works again (AGC2 / D-146, 2026-06-06).** The deviation pivot is
  now each band's own running average (`BandDeviationTracker`), so `bass_dev`
  fires ~40-50 % and `mid_dev`/`treb_dev` — long dead — fire on real music. Two
  caveats: (1) mid/treble `*_dev` carry *smaller amplitude* than `bass_dev`
  (those bands are quiet post-AGC) → use a larger gain for them; (2) all band
  `*_dev` have a ~1-2 s cold-start warmup on the session's first track (the
  per-band average converges through the AGC startup spike). Signed `f.*_rel`
  remains a fine choice where you want a both-ways swing — recenter it
  (`(f.bass_rel + 0.5)`) to rest at neutral.
- **`spectral_flux` and the beat fields are reliably alive** across genres and
  capture paths — good for texture motion and accents.
- **Don't build a load-bearing layer on `f.mid`/`f.treble`** unless your
  target music is genuinely mid/treble-rich — measure first.
- **One primitive per visual layer at one timescale** (the existing
  `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive` rule). The liveness check is upstream of
  it: first pick alive primitives, then assign one per layer.
- **The differentiator between "danced on LF" and "muted on Spotify" is rarely
  a single primitive** — it's usually raw amplitude (slot 1/2 buffers are NOT
  AGC-normalised; see the Dragon Bloom waveform-RMS-normalisation note) or the
  music itself being sparser. Measure both sessions before concluding the
  preset or the engine is at fault.

## 16. Open Questions

Items to resolve during Phase V execution:

1. **SwiftLint per-glob config feasibility.** Does SwiftLint support path-based `file_length` overrides in a single `.swiftlint.yml`? If not, a second config file + script. To confirm in Increment V.1.
2. **Shader-compilation time budget.** The utility library adds ~7000 lines of preamble. Runtime `device.makeLibrary(source:)` compilation may become noticeable at launch. Measure and consider precompiled Metal archives (AIR) if it exceeds 500 ms.
3. **Texture memory for baked normal / height maps.** POM requires heightmaps. Ceramic / concrete / bark presets want real textures, not just procedural. Where do these ship? Git LFS alongside ML weights? Size ceiling?
4. **Reference image authorship.** Matt curates, but for 20+ presets that's significant curation work. Can Phase V.5 be incremental — each preset-uplift session ships both the shader and the reference images?
5. **Matt-review cadence.** The rubric says "Matt signs off on reference frame match." For 7 uplift increments (V.7–V.13) that's 7+ review gates. Compress via batched review sessions, or distributed throughout?

These do not block Phase V from starting. V.1 (noise + PBR utility library expansion) can begin today.

## 17. Preset Metadata Format (JSON sidecar)

Every preset ships a `<PresetName>.json` sidecar alongside its `.metal` file. The sidecar drives Orchestrator scoring, the V.6 fidelity rubric, render-pass dispatch, and scene-uniform construction for ray-march presets. The schema below was originally documented in `CLAUDE.md §Preset Metadata Format`; moved here as part of the 2026-05-13 doc refactor.


```json
{
  "name": "Glass Brutalist",
  "family": "geometric",
  "duration": 30,
  "passes": ["ray_march", "ssgi", "post_process"],
  "scene_camera": { "position": [0, 2, -3], "target": [0, 2, 4], "fov": 65 },
  "scene_lights": [{ "position": [0, 4.5, 2], "color": [1, 0.95, 0.9], "intensity": 3.0 }],
  "environment": "gallery",
  "scene_fog": 0.015,
  "stem_affinity": {
    "drums": "pillar_squeeze",
    "bass": "pillar_scale",
    "other": "glass_scale",
    "vocals": "color_warmth"
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `name` | required | Display name |
| `family` | optional | Aesthetic family — a STRICT `PresetCategory` enum (PUB.7 correction: this row previously listed values like `abstract` that don't exist; an unknown value throws the whole sidecar decode → the preset degrades to defaults with an os.log error). Valid: `waveform`, `fractal`, `geometric`, `particles`, `hypnotic`, `supernova`, `reaction`, `drawing`, `dancer`, `sparkle`, `volumetric`, `painterly`, `transition` (D-123; see PresetCategory.swift for the current list). Omit for diagnostics. |
| `duration` | 30 | Preferred scene duration (seconds). Orchestrator can override. |
| `passes` | `["direct"]` | Required render passes. Backward-compatible: falls back to `synthesizePasses(from:)` reading legacy booleans. |
| `beat_source` | `"bass"` | Which onset drives beat uniform: `bass`, `mid`, `treble`, `composite` |
| `beat_zoom` | 0.03 | Beat accent zoom (keep < base_zoom) |
| `beat_rot` | 0.01 | Beat accent rotation |
| `base_zoom` | 0.12 | Continuous energy zoom (primary driver) |
| `base_rot` | 0.03 | Continuous energy rotation (primary driver) |
| `decay` | 0.955 | Feedback decay. 0.85 = short trails, 0.95 = long. |
| `beat_sensitivity` | 1.0 | Beat pulse multiplier. Range 0–3.0. |
| `stem_affinity` | optional | Maps stems to visual parameters for Orchestrator pairing. |
| `mesh_thread_count` | 64 | Thread count for mesh shader dispatch. |
| `visual_density` | 0.5 | 0 = sparse/minimal, 1 = packed/busy. Low-arousal tracks prefer low density. (Increment 4.0) |
| `motion_intensity` | 0.5 | 0 = static/slow, 1 = fast/kinetic. Informs tempo match during scoring. (Increment 4.0) |
| `color_temperature_range` | `[0.3, 0.7]` | `[cool, warm]` each 0–1. 0 = cold blue, 1 = hot orange. Intersected with mood-derived target range. (Increment 4.0) |
| `fatigue_risk` | `"medium"` | `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"`. Controls cooldown penalty between reuses. Unknown values log a warning and fall back to medium. (Increment 4.0) |
| `transition_affordances` | `["crossfade"]` | Array of `"crossfade"`, `"cut"`, `"morph"`. Styles this preset tolerates as incoming/outgoing transition. (Increment 4.0) |
| `section_suitability` | all sections | Array of `"ambient"`, `"buildup"`, `"peak"`, `"bridge"`, `"comedown"`. Sections this preset suits. Default = all (no penalty). (Increment 4.0) |
| `complexity_cost` | `{"tier1":1.0,"tier2":1.0}` | Estimated ms at 1080p per device tier (M1/M2 = tier1, M3+ = tier2). Accepts scalar or `{"tier1":x,"tier2":y}`. (Increment 4.0) |
| `certified` | `false` | Matt-approved reference-frame match. Only flipped to `true` after reviewing against `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/<preset>/` references. Orchestrator excludes uncertified presets by default. (Increment V.6) |
| `rubric_profile` | `"full"` | Which rubric ladder to apply. `"full"` = 7 mandatory + 4 expected + 4 preferred. `"lightweight"` = 4 items for stylized 2D / diagnostic presets (Plasma, Waveform, Nebula, SpectralCartograph). Unknown strings fall back to `"full"` with a warning. (Increment V.6) |
| `rubric_hints` | `{}` | Author-asserted flags for rubric items the analyzer cannot auto-detect. `"hero_specular": true` satisfies P1; `"dust_motes": true` satisfies P3. Missing keys default to `false`. (Increment V.6) |
| `audio_routes` | `[]` | The preset's audio-routing manifest — see §17.1. Required non-empty for certification (QG.1). |
| `feedback_pixel_format` | drawable | mv_warp feedback-buffer format: `"rgba16Float"` (HDR bloom headroom — safe ONLY for decay-bounded feedback: Nacre/Floret/Glaze) or `"bgra8Unorm"` (linear non-sRGB 8-bit — Fata Morgana, D-139). Omit for faithful no-decay warps: the 8-bit clamp is load-bearing (Dragon Bloom, D-137 — float over-accumulates to pale white). Unknown values warn + fall back to the drawable. (PUB.4) |
| `inspired_by` | optional | Milkdrop provenance block (D-111 as amended by D-113): `milkdrop_filename`, `original_artist`, `sha256` (of the source `.milk` when one was on disk) or `source_form` (when the source was a butterchurn built-in), `pack`. Required on every Milkdrop-inspired preset, paired with a row in `docs/CREDITS.md`. Documentation-only — the engine does not decode it. (PUB.1) |

**Engine / advanced keys (PUB.7 — completing the schema; every key `PresetDescriptor` decodes).** The table above is the contributor-facing core. These are decoded too — an mv_warp preset REQUIRES the first two:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `fragment_function` | `<snake_name>_fragment` | Fragment entry point. Every mv_warp preset sets it; `<prefix>_warp_fragment` / `<prefix>_comp_fragment` / `<prefix>_blur_fragment` in the same library override the shared mv_warp defaults (D-139). |
| `vertex_function` | `fullscreen_vertex` | Vertex entry point (mv_warp presets typically keep the default). |
| `description` / `author` | optional | Display metadata. NACRE.5: the description must describe SHIPPED behaviour, not aspiration. |
| `shader_file` | sibling `.metal` | RICERCAR-RW: a sidecar with NO sibling `.metal` may reuse another preset's shader by naming it here (Ricercar reuses Skein's). |
| `natural_cycle_seconds` | none | Caps the scorer's `maxDuration` for presets whose visual cycle (e.g. Arachne's 60 s build) outranks the formula (V.7.6.2 §5). |
| `wait_for_completion_event` | `false` | Preset signals its own completion → `nextPreset()` (definite-end-state presets; Arachne canonical). |
| `requires_regular_beat` | `false` | Hard-excluded from planning on beat-irregular tracks (D-154). |
| `is_diagnostic` | `false` | Excluded from planner selection entirely (D-074); dev/diagnostic presets only. |
| `text_overlay` | `false` | Binds `texture(12)` text overlay (SpectralCartograph-class diagnostics). |
| `stages` | none | Staged-composition pass list (V.ENGINE.1) — per-stage fragment + `samples` wiring; see the staged paradigm section and §17.2 for the per-stage keys. |
| `exclude_from_cycling` | `false` | Manual/segment cycling steps over this preset (PR.0). For harness fixtures that must stay reachable by name but that nobody should land on by pressing next — `Staged Sandbox`, `Poisson Sandbox`. **Not** implied by `is_diagnostic`: Spectral Cartograph is diagnostic and deliberately stays browsable. Was a name literal in `PresetLoader`; promoted to this flag at ALFVEN.1 when a second fixture appeared. |
| `marks` | none | mv_warp scene-geometry overlay block (draw params + chromatic + comp + beat pump); Dragon Bloom-class strand overlays. |
| `scene_camera` / `scene_lights` / `scene_fog` / `scene_fog_near` / `scene_far_plane` | ray-march defaults | Ray-march scene setup — see §GPU Contract Details in ARCHITECTURE. `scene_lights` takes up to 4 lights (RMENV.1 multi-light; key/rim/fill/accent). |
| `scene_dolly_speed` | `0` (camera-static) | Forward camera dolly speed (world-units/s) seeding `RayMarchPipeline.cameraDollySpeed`; per-frame speed is bass-modulated `× (0.5 + bass)`. Sidecar-owned (not app code) so the engine-side replay harness renders the flight — BUG-074. Volumetric Lithograph = 5.0. |
| `scene_orbit_speed` | `0` (camera-static) | Camera orbit speed (rad/s) around the world Y-axis through the origin, seeding `RayMarchPipeline.cameraOrbitSpeed`. Orthogonal to `scene_dolly_speed` — no current preset drives both. Sidecar-owned, same `applyPreset`/`SessionReplayHarness` dual-seed pattern as the dolly (WHIT.2b). Makes a ray-marched shape's roundness/depth legible via parallax when a static shot wouldn't sell it. **No current consumer** — Rosette shipped at 0.12 (WHIT.2b), removed it (WHIT.2c, Matt: "eliminate the orbit"; a constant-speed orbit reads as disconnected from the music, and for a wholly z=0-planar scene periodically flattens the whole composition edge-on), then was retired itself (D-224). Capability kept — cheap, generic, and the failure both times was Rosette-specific, not the mechanism; a future preset with real depth variation and/or an audio-modulated rate is a different case. |
| `environment` | optional (`nil` → default interior) | Ray-march IBL environment surfaces reflect + take ambient from (RMENV.2). `"gallery"` = a high-contrast gallery interior (bright skylight strips, dark floor) that makes polished metals read as metal; omit/`"default"` = the low-contrast interior. Opt-in — omitting it is byte-identical to pre-RMENV. |
| `additive_blend` | `false` | Mesh-shader additive blending. |
| `ferrofluid` | none | FFO thin-film params (preset-specific block). |
| `use_feedback` / `use_mesh_shader` / `use_particles` / `use_post_process` / `use_ray_march` | legacy | Decode-only booleans consumed by `synthesizePasses(from:)` for pre-`passes` sidecars — never write these in a new preset; declare `passes`. |

### 17.1 `audio_routes` — the audio-routing manifest (QG.1)

Every route the preset's code actually consumes, declared so the route-coverage gate can assert it fires on real music:

```json
"audio_routes": [
  { "route": "downbeat_camera_push", "primitive": "barPhase01", "kind": "accent" },
  { "route": "vortex_swirl",         "primitive": "bassDev",    "kind": "continuous" }
]
```

- `route` — short snake_case name of the **visual behaviour** driven (what a viewer would see change).
- `primitive` — the **Swift-side field name** of `FeatureVector` / `StemFeatures` the code reads (camelCase: `bassDev`, `drumsEnergyDev`, `barPhase01`, `pulseAmp01`, …). Validated against the session-CSV-recordable primitive allowlist by `AudioRouteSchemaTests` — an unknown primitive fails the suite.
- `kind` — the floor class `RouteCoverageTests` applies over the canonical fixture set (`Tests/UzumeEngineTests/Fixtures/route_coverage/`): `continuous` = non-constant + variance floor; `accent` = ≥ 1 firing per fixture; `structural` = ≥ 1 section event on a fixture that contains one; `gate` = peak ≥ 0.9 on every fixture. **Declare an enable as `gate`, never `continuous`** — a silence gate (`pulseAmp01`) or confidence gate sits pinned open through music, which is correct behaviour but reads as a driver under `continuous` and clears that floor only because the fixtures open in silence (BUG-088, measured on Aurora Veil: pinned 1.000 through music, p5–p95 range 0.000). The only failure a gate has is never opening.

Rules: **audit before declaring** — a declared route the code doesn't read is as wrong as an unread route left undeclared; enumerate from the `.metal` (snake_case fields) *and* the preset's CPU driver (`RenderPipeline+<Preset>.swift` / `<Preset>State.swift` / `<Preset>Geometry.swift` — mv_warp and geometry presets consume most primitives on the CPU). One row per (behaviour × primitive); a stem-summed drive declares each contributing primitive. A red route in `RouteCoverageTests` is a **defect to file, not a floor to tune** (QG.1: "red route = the gate working").

---

### 17.2 `stages[]` — per-stage keys for the `staged` paradigm

A `staged` preset's `stages` array is ordered; the last entry writes the drawable
and every earlier entry renders into a named offscreen texture. Per-stage keys:

| Key | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `name` | required | Unique within the preset. The key later stages use in `samples`. |
| `fragment_function` | required | Metal fragment function in the preset's `.metal`. |
| `samples` | `[]` | Earlier stages whose outputs this stage reads, bound at `[[texture(13)]]`, `[[texture(14)]]`, … in declared order. **Max 7** — `[[texture(20)]]` is the persistent-state slot. |
| `persistent` | `false` | The stage owns a ping-pong texture pair that survives across frames; frame N samples frame N-1's output at `[[texture(20)]]`. The pair is zeroed at allocation, on preset switch, and by `resetStagedPersistentState()`, and re-zeroed by the non-finite watchdog. **A persistent final (drawable-writing) stage is a decode error** — the view owns the drawable, so there is nothing to persist. (ALFVEN.1, D-244) |
| `iterations` | `1` | Render passes encoded per frame, ping-ponging this stage's own pair, with its `samples` inputs held constant across all of them. Range `1…64`. Turns a stage into a relaxation solver. Composes with `persistent`: iteration 1 of frame N+1 warm-starts from frame N's state. (ALFVEN.1, D-244) |
| `pixel_format` | `rgba16Float` | Offscreen colour format. Allowlist: `rgba16Float`, `rgba32Float`, `rg32Float`. Unknown values warn and fall back to `rgba16Float` (the `feedback_pixel_format` precedent, PUB.4). Ignored on the final stage, which always takes the drawable format. A Poisson/Jacobi solve needs `rgba32Float`. (ALFVEN.1, D-244) |

An iterated persistent stage is how a GPU solver is authored here — the whole
example is `PoissonSandbox.json` + `PoissonSandbox.metal`:

```json
{ "name": "pressure", "fragment_function": "poisson_sandbox_pressure_fragment",
  "samples": ["divergence"], "persistent": true, "iterations": 24,
  "pixel_format": "rgba32Float" }
```

Two things to know before authoring one. **The warm start is the point**: at 256²
a cold 24-sweep Jacobi solve removes only ~11 % of the domain-scale error in one
frame, and it is persistence across frames that gets it to the answer (see the
measured tables in `PoissonProjectionConvergenceTests`). And **stateful stages
need a multi-frame harness before the preset**, not after — copy
`PersistentStagedPathHarnessTemplate`.

## 18. Painterly drip/pour technique — swept-capsule pour + splatter morphology (Skein)

The `painterly` canvas-hold family (Skein, a Dragon Bloom sibling — D-135/D-138/D-142/D-143) accumulates 2D marks **losslessly** on a persistent feedback canvas (identity warp, `decay=1.0`, `chromatic=0`): paint composites normal-alpha **once** on landing and is then carried forward byte-for-byte. The canvas is a **temporal integral** (the finished frame is the song's fingerprint). All mark geometry is 2D-SDF compositing in screen UV — no ray-march, no particles. This section is the authoring handbook for the mark vocabulary (Skein.1 pour line; Skein.2 splatter morphology).

### 18.1 Port the VisComp 2014 layered model — do not reinvent the drip vocabulary (FA #64/#73)

The clean decomposition of Pollock's drip style is the **VisComp 2014 layered model** (Ni et al., *Layered modeling and generation of Pollock's drip style*): four sequentially-composited **opaque alpha-over** layers — **background** (the ground) → **irregular-shape** (pour pools where the stream lingered) → **line** (Catmull-Rom trajectory, width tapers toward the endpoints as the stream thins) → **droplet** (satellite spatter distributed **perpendicular/forward to the line**, size falling off **exponentially/polynomially with distance**). Map these onto in-shader SDF marks; unify every layer's coverage into one `cover = max(...)` accumulator returned as `float4(white, cover)` (the per-frame max + the cross-frame normal-alpha blend is the bake-and-hold).

### 18.2 Bake-and-hold via an age-ramp redraw window (no CPU state)

A mark (a pour-tail point or a flick's droplet) need not persist via per-frame physics — the **canvas holds it**. Each frame, redraw the marks within a short age window (`age = t − T_event < window`) with an opacity that ramps low→high as the mark ages (`op = mix(0.05, 1.0, smoothstep(0,0.8,ageFrac))`); the cross-frame normal-alpha accumulation converges the pixel to opaque, then it ages out of the window and is **frozen** in the held canvas. This is closed-form, deterministic, and needs **no `SkeinState`, no per-preset buffer, no engine touch** — the painter trajectory and every flick are a pure function of `features.time`, and droplet placement is a deterministic **hash of (flick index, droplet index)** (never time-as-RNG; §5.7 determinism is a headline property).

### 18.3 Droplet morphology — distinct matte dots, not merged froth, not sci-fi sparks

- **Velocity-biased dispersion.** Offset each droplet from the flick point by `dist·(cos θ, sin θ)` where `θ = travelDir ± coneHalf`. Make `coneHalf` **shrink with distance** (`mix(π, 0.42, distFrac)`): near satellites scatter all directions (the splash halo), far ones are forward-thrown. This forward bias is what reads as *flung* paint.
- **Exp/poly falloff with distance.** `distFrac = pow(rnd, 1.5)` concentrates satellites near the line; size falls off too (`dr = base·mix(0.9, 0.18, distFrac)·sizeVar`) — big near, fine far. This dense-near/sparse-far gradient is the satellite-halo signature.
- **Distinct, not merged.** *Durable learning (Skein.2):* big + dense + ragged droplets **overlap into amorphous "cauliflower froth"** that reads as foam, not spatter. Fix with **small + crisp + wider-flung + slightly-fewer** dots so dot-spacing > dot-diameter and they read as discrete marks even when dense. The references' dense patches are still *distinct* dots over visible ground.
- **Ragged edges, never clean circles** (anti-ref: polka-dots). Perturb the radius with a **≥4-octave 2D fBM** (`skein_fbm2` = 4× `perlin2d` with an inter-octave rotation). FA #43 avoidance: `perlin2d` is *gradient* noise sampled at non-lattice scaled coords (scale ≥ 3), centred at 0 — ride it as a `±amp` radius perturbation, never `smoothstep`-threshold it. Put the raggedness in the threshold *radius* (`drr = dr·(1 + amp·noise)`), not in the AA band.
- **Round, not square — use ISOTROPIC AA + a radius floor.** *Durable learning (Skein.2, Matt M7 2026-06-05):* do **not** take the AA band from `fwidth(length(q−dpos))`. The gradient of `length()` is the radial unit vector, so `fwidth(dc)` is ~41 % wider at the diagonals (`|cosθ|+|sinθ|` ranges 1→√2) than at the cardinals → the cardinal edges are sharp and **snap to the axis-aligned pixel grid (flat sides)** while the diagonals stay soft (rounded corners) = **rounded-square droplets**. Instead use an **isotropic** pixel size `px = max(fwidth(q.x), fwidth(q.y))` (≈ `1/height` in aspect-corrected q-units) for the AA (`aa = px·aaScale`), and **floor the radius** at `drr = max(drr, px·1.5)` so even the finest far satellites are ≥ ~1.5 px and read as round dots rather than a single square texel. Verifier: the bbox-fill of a medium droplet is ~0.65–0.78 (round/ragged) vs ~0.9–1.0 (square) — regression-locked in `SkeinCanvasHoldTest`.
- **Matte, opaque alpha-over.** White-on-cream marks brighten cream→white only (no mud is possible with one colour; multi-colour palettes at Skein.3 must keep opaque-overwrite so layers occlude rather than average to brown — anti-ref: dead mat). A verifier check: no canvas channel ever drops below the ground's darkest channel.

### 18.4 Filament discipline — forward-gated, or it becomes the particle-burst anti-reference

*Durable learning (Skein.2):* drawing a straight thin thread from the flick point to **every** scattered droplet produces a **radial spoke starburst** — a sea-urchin/firework that **is** the neon/sci-fi particle-burst anti-reference. The references' threads are *forward, wandering tendrils*, not radial spokes. Gate filaments **forward-only** (`dot(normalize(dropPos−flick), travelDir) > 0.3`), **short** (mid-distance droplets only), and **sparse** (hash-gated ~16 %), so they read as a few directional spray-streaks (a string of paint that stretched along the throw), never a web or a burst. When in doubt, the main pour line + its trailing tail already carry most of the "thread/skein" reading; per-flick filaments are a minor accent.

### 18.5 Viscosity axis — one debug scalar (Skein.2) → per-stem spectral centroid (Skein.3)

Viscosity ∈ [0,1] (thin-fast-fine ↔ thick-slow-gloopy; §1.2) shapes every mark at once:

| Viscosity → | Thin (0, bright/high-centroid) | Thick (1, dark/low-centroid) |
|---|---|---|
| Line width | Skein.1 baseline (**mix floor = 1.0**) | fatter pools (`mix(1.0, 1.5, v)`) |
| Satellite count | many (`~46`) | few (`~13`) |
| Satellite spread | wide (`~0.17`) | close (`~0.075`) |
| Droplet size | fine | big |
| Edge | feathered + soft AA (reads translucent) | crisper |

*Durable learning:* the viscosity → line-width factor must **never narrow below the Skein.1 width** (`mix(1.0, …)`, not `mix(0.85, …)`), or the thin pole regresses the Skein.1 pour-line continuity invariant. Carry the thin-pole "fineness" in the satellites/edges, not by thinning the spine. For Skein.2 the viscosity is a closed-form **debug** sweep of `features.time` (period ~12 s) so a still frame and a multi-second contact sheet both exhibit both poles; Skein.3 replaces it with the per-stem spectral centroid (one primitive per layer — D-026, `feedback_audio_layer_one_primitive`). True per-mark *translucency* (a baked alpha < 1) is **not** achievable with normal-alpha bake-and-hold — it converges to opaque over the window; the thin-paint translucency *read* is carried by edge softness + size + density, with real wet/dry sheen deferred to the wetness channel (ENGINE.2 / Skein.4).

### 18.6 Performance — scissor to this frame's marks (cost ∝ new marks, §6)

A fullscreen overlay fragment must early-out cheaply away from the few active marks. Two-level scissor: (1) a **per-flick bounding-disc reject** (`length(q − flick) > spread + maxDrop` → skip the whole ≤64-droplet loop), and (2) a **per-droplet cheap reject** (`length(q − dropPos) > dr·1.7` → skip *before* sampling the expensive ragged-edge noise). Result: ~99 % of fragments pay only a couple of distance checks; only the small discs around 1–2 active flicks pay the inner cost. Cap droplets N ≈ 64. This keeps the bake-into-canvas amortisation (past marks are stored pixels, never re-evaluated) — the preset gets *no more expensive* as the painting fills.

### 18.7 Test parity (FA #66) — exercise the live marks-on-top dispatch path

The temporal bake-and-hold only exists in the live `scene → warp → overlay → blit → swap` loop; a single `preset.pipelineState` draw cannot show it. Drive the multi-frame harness through that loop advancing `features.time` (`SkeinCanvasHoldTest`). For the splatter, isolate the **pour-LINE** continuity from the by-design disconnected satellites with a trajectory **corridor** (a Swift mirror of the painter `skeinPainterPos`, masked to a thin band around the line) — Skein.2 satellites are separate components on purpose, so whole-canvas continuity is intentionally < 1. **Watch the Y-flip:** Metal render-target row 0 = top = clip y +1 = uv.y **1.0**, so any test that maps pixel row → painter uv-space must flip (`uv.y = 1 − (py+0.5)/h`); the connectivity/brightness analyses are flip-agnostic but a distance-to-trajectory analysis is not.

### 18.8 Stem colour + audio routing (Skein.3) — per-stem legibility on a feedback canvas

Skein.3 makes the painting musical: the overlay fragment consumes a per-preset `SkeinUniforms` at **fragment slot 6** (the ENGINE.1.2 gated marks-on-top binding), and the painter clock + onset-burst ring + per-track seed live in CPU `SkeinState` (the closed-form fragment has no history). Durable craft rules for any per-stem-coloured feedback-canvas preset:

- **OPAQUE compositing, never mud.** Output the **TOPMOST** mark's colour, not a blend of overlapping marks. In the fragment, track a paired `(bestCover, bestCol)` and update *both* only when a mark's coverage beats `bestCover` — so an overlap takes whichever mark covers the fragment most. Two stem colours never average to brown (the dead-mat anti-ref). The normal-alpha overlay blend then occludes the held canvas. (Cross-frame: a mark redrawn at full op before it ages out bakes to its *pure* colour, so the held canvas stays mud-free.)

- **sRGB-decode the palette (FA #71).** The feedback canvas is `.bgra8Unorm_srgb`, so the shader's linear output is sRGB-ENCODED on store. Define the palette as the intended **display (sRGB)** colours and sRGB-DECODE them to linear *before packing into the buffer* (`SkeinState.srgbToLinear`); the store then round-trips back to the display colour. **Without the decode, dark stems (charcoal / oxblood) lift to washed mid-tones** — they read pale *and* become indistinguishable (Skein.3 measured drums/bass painting **0** classifiable pixels until the decode landed; 933 / 2905 after). The colour-separation test classifies rendered pixels against the *display* palette, so keep the public palette display-space and decode only the packed copy.

- **Per-stem onsets come from `*_energy_dev`, not `*_beat`.** Only `drums_beat` carries a real BeatDetector pulse — `vocals/bass/other_beat` are reserved-zero. Derive each stem's onset from rising **activity** on its `*_energy_dev` (a D-026 deviation) in CPU state. Fire **throttled-while-active** (above threshold, rate-limited by a refractory ~0.14 s), not rising-edge-only: real onsets are sparse (7 drum onsets in 20 s on a jazz track), and one-burst-per-edge laid too little colour for the wandering line not to over-dominate. Throttled-while-active gives splatter density ∝ activity while the refractory keeps it from machine-gunning (FA #1/#4).

- **The dominant-stem line is a DISCRETE argmax, never a colour EMA.** Colour the continuous pour line by `argmax(smoothed per-stem energy_dev)` and set the line colour *directly* to that stem's palette entry — an EMA *between two pure colours* passes through the mud midpoint during transitions. Discrete switching just means the newly-laid segment is the new colour; baked segments keep theirs (the line records who led when).

- **The line will overpaint sparse bursts if it dominates.** The wandering line fills the canvas and redraws over baked bursts it crosses, so a single bold dominant-colour line buries the sparse per-stem accents. Keep bursts **large enough to survive the thin line** and **numerous enough to read** (the throttled-while-active firing above), or one stem's colour swallows the canvas. Verify per-stem painted-pixel counts on a real session, not just spawn counts — a stem can spawn bursts that are entirely overpainted.

- **Freeze the LINE colour per-segment too — a redrawn closed-form tail recolours on every dominant switch (Skein.4.1).** The bursts freeze their colour at spawn, but the continuous pour line is *recomputed every frame* over a ~40-frame tail and painted in ONE current `lineCol`, so when the dominant stem switches the recent ~40 frames of already-laid line recolour ("the colour changes in the middle of a stroke," Matt M7 2026-06-09). Fix: a small **colour-breakpoint ring** (push `(painterTau-at-switch, colour, offset)` on each dominant **change**; an additive tail of the slot-6 uniforms, mirroring the burst ring). The fragment looks up each tail sample's lay-time colour by the painter-clock value it was laid at (latest breakpoint with `tauStart ≤ sample-τ`). This is the per-burst freeze applied to the line. **Crucially, coverage is unchanged:** with ONE per-frame radius, `max over per-capsule coverage ≡ 1 − smoothstep(min segDist − r)`, so tracking the nearest *drawn* segment to pick its frozen colour does not re-introduce the M7-round-3 scalloping/rings.

- **"A colour change is a NEW pour," not a recoloured seam — give each pour a bounded position JUMP (Matt's call, Skein.4.1 option 2).** Matt wanted a colour change to read as the painter grabbing a new paint container, not one continuous line that merely changes colour at a seam. So each breakpoint also carries a small **bounded, non-cumulative** position offset (fixed magnitude ~0.05 UV, rotated by the golden angle per switch — seeded for determinism, non-cumulative so the line never drifts off canvas, golden-angle so consecutive pours are always well-separated). The new pour draws at `painterPos + offset_new`, the old at `+ offset_old`, and the segment that would BRIDGE two pours (different breakpoint `start`) is simply **not drawn** → a clean gap. A pure *temporal* gap (skip frames, no jump) does NOT work: at slow/pooling movement neighbouring capsules overlap and refill the gap, so only a *spatial* jump reads as a new pour at all speeds. Flick the onset bursts from the jumped position too (but compute their throw direction from the un-offset path, so a switch-frame jump never spikes the throw vector).

- **COMMIT to a pour — the dominant-stem argmax flickers far faster than a pour reads, so gate the switch on a minimum dwell + hysteresis (Skein.4.1 M7-round-2).** The pour colour is `argmax(smoothed per-stem energy_dev)`, which on real music switches constantly: measured **63 switches / 44 s, median pour 0.2 s**. With a new pour = a new colour + a jump, that makes the line "very short rather than a long continuous dripping/pouring across the canvas" (Matt). Fix: a new pour COMMITS only when (a) the current pour has lasted a **minimum length** (`minPourTau`, painter-clock — size it against the trajectory's UV-per-τ so the minimum is ≈ half a canvas), AND (b) the challenger leads the incumbent's smoothed energy by a **hysteresis** factor (~1.25×, no flicker between near-equal stems). The first pour commits immediately. Net on the same session: **63 → 10 long pours (~4 s avg)**. Drive the pour's colour/width/viscosity off the *committed* stem (not the instantaneous argmax) so the whole pour is coherent. Keep the **bursts ungated** (they are the per-onset accents, and they read fine connecting to the long line — Pollock-correct). Caveat for the test surface: once the line is long+continuous, droplets connect into one big component, so a "count separable droplet blobs" metric goes to ~0 even though the splatter is firing — gate the route on the per-stem **spawn tally + busy≫calm** instead, and keep any blob-count as a diagnostic only.

### 18.9 Wet/dry sheen (Skein.ENGINE.2 + Skein.4) — a read-time wetness channel + GGX-gated-by-wetness sheen

The wet-now / dry-past legibility device (`SKEIN_DESIGN §1.4`): freshly-landed paint glistens, the accumulated past is matte, so the eye tracks the musical **now**. Durable craft for adding a read-time "freshness" sheen to any feedback-canvas preset:

- **Wetness lives in the canvas ALPHA channel; drying is a READ-TIME effect (never a destructive RGB multiply).** The RGB is the lossless permanent paint record — drying it in place quantises/drifts the 8-bit record (`SKEIN_DESIGN §5.5`). Put the transient wetness in **alpha** (linear 8-bit on an sRGB texture — sRGB never touches A). The marks-on-top overlay already STAMPS coverage into A (the normal-alpha blend writes `A = bestCover² + dst.a·(1−cover)` → solid fresh paint → A≈1; no new stamp code). The hold/warp fragment DECAYS A each frame while holding RGB byte-identically. The display fragment READS A as the sheen mask. (D-149 / approach A — cleaner than a dedicated R8 texture: no new texture, no new pass, the shared warp fragment untouched.)

- **The decay PAUSES at silence — gate it on energy, not wall-clock.** `wetnessDecay = exp(-rate·dt·stemMix)` (the `accumulated_audio_time` semantics): at silence `stemMix→0` → factor→1 → the held painting freezes wet (no sheen drift). This is **not a new audio routing** — it reuses the existing silence gate (FA #67); wetness = *where paint landed*, which the overlay already knows.

- **Own the warp + comp fragments via the per-prefix override — touch no shared GPU code.** `PresetLoader` resolves `<prefix>_warp_fragment` / `<prefix>_comp_fragment` before the shared `mvWarp_*` defaults (the Fata Morgana precedent). Defining `skein_warp_fragment` (decays A) and `skein_comp_fragment` (the sheen) leaves the shared fragments **byte-identical** for every other preset by construction. The one shared touch — a `wetnessDecay` uniform bound at warp-fragment `buffer(1)`, default 1.0 — is inert for presets whose fragment doesn't declare it.

- **A flat 2D canvas has no normal — derive one from the canvas LUMINANCE GRADIENT.** Central-difference / Sobel of luminance over neighbour texels → `N = normalize(-dL/dx·k, -dL/dy·k, 1)` (the standard heightfield→normal bump). Paint ridges/edges tilt N → they catch the overhead light; flat ground keeps N≈+z. Ground the specular in **GGX/Trowbridge-Reitz** (Walter et al. 2007), **tonemapped** (`ggx/(ggx+knee)`) so the unbounded NDF peak becomes a bounded edge glint while a broad gloss stays visible; drop roughness with wetness (wet = glossier).

- **The sheen is a HIGHLIGHT, not a recolour — keep the stem colours reading through.** A full-strength broad whitening washes the palette toward white (the per-stem legibility dies). Use a **hard wetness gate** (`smoothstep` on A) so the specular fires on WET paint and ~0 on the dried past, an **additive glint** (warm-white — it preserves the hue underneath, so the stem colour reads through without any saturation trick), and **dry → matte + slight desaturation**. Verify the sheened BLIT preserves the raw canvas's separable-colour count (all 4 stems survived). Gate the specular on a **paint-present mask** (distance from the ground colour) so the bare canvas (whose A also seeds at 1 from the clear) reads matte — wet *paint*, not a wet *floor*.

- **sRGB at the blit (FA #71): do NOT manually decode.** When the feedback texture is `.bgra8Unorm_srgb`, sampling it **auto-decodes to linear** — do the lighting in linear and let the sRGB drawable re-encode on store. (This is the inverse of Fata Morgana, whose feedback is linear `.bgra8Unorm`, so FM's comp output *is* the display value and needs a manual decode. Know which case you're in.)

- **Test through the BLIT, over a long-enough run (FA #66).** The sheen lives in the display/comp fragment, so the gate must read the **blit** output (not the raw canvas the other tests read) and compare it against the canvas (the sheen = the difference). Partition painted texels by wetness and assert wet-region sheen > dry-region sheen. Run **long enough that all active stems have painted** — a short run can land entirely in an intro section (one dominant stem), which reads as "the sheen killed the colours" when it's really "the colours weren't there yet" (round-1 false alarm). The perceptual "eye tracks the now" is the live-motion M7; a static contact sheet under-shows a temporal effect.

**M7 rounds 2–3 learnings (Matt 2026-06-09 — "overlapping circles that smooth into a line after a second"; round-2 "still shows rings when the lines move slowly" + "the glistening just makes the paint look SPECKLED — it does not convey wet"). The wet sheen draws the eye to the live edge, so the live edge must read as wet dribbled paint. Three hard-won corrections:**

- **The "overlapping circles" are a RENDERING-FORMULA bug, not just the trailing tail. Render a stroke as ONE union SDF — `min over segments of (segDist − r)` — NOT `max over per-capsule coverage`.** Round-2 removed an age-taper (a per-sample radius+opacity ramp) and the rings PERSISTED; the deeper cause is the max-over-capsules formulation with a PER-SEGMENT radius: at slow / looping movement the clustered tail samples have varying micro-speed → varying `r_k` on co-located capsules → the union boundary SCALLOPS, and the sheen's gradient-normal amplifies the slight coverage ridges into concentric arcs. A union SDF with ONE per-frame radius (viscosity/flow widen it; the overall tip→tail speed thins it — never per-segment) is a single smooth tube with a uniformly-solid interior — no rings, and no internal ridges for the sheen to find. Keep the width MODEST (§18.8): an overall-speed *widening* fattens the whole line during looping and BURIES the splatter droplets — bias the speed term to *thinning* only.

- **Wet paint is DARKER + more SATURATED, not brighter — and a micro-normal "sparkle" reads as GRAIN, not wet.** Round-1 brightened the wet body (a broad gloss) → "ok but not glistening"; round-2 added a fine `perlin2d` micro-normal sparkle → "speckled, not wet." Both wrong. The physical wet cue is **darken + saturate the body** (water-soaked depth) plus a **coherent glossy catch-light** (GGX from the smooth luminance-gradient normal — a *reflection*, never noise); dry paint is the opposite (lighter + desaturated = matte). A noise/speckle normal reads as digital grain; a flat solid stroke can only glint at its *edges*, but a darker+richer body + an edge catch-light is what reads as wet. (Supersedes the round-2 "two-term broad+sparkle" advice.) **The DARKEN must DOMINATE the gloss.** A *broad* glossy highlight (low-frequency / high-gain) brightens the fresh paint enough to INVERT the read — it appears "lighter on application, darker as it dries" (Matt M7-round-3), the opposite of wet. Keep the body darken strong (×~0.74) and the gloss a small, TIGHT glint (roughness ~0.12, modest gain) — a wet *shine*, never a broad brightening — so the net effect on fresh paint is clearly darker (Skein.4: wet Δluma −18 vs dry +8).

- **Measure the sheen's CONTENT-ISOLATED effect (`blit − canvas`), not absolute wet-vs-dry.** Recent (wet) paint is a single saturated stroke; old (dry) paint is mixed-down accumulation — so *absolute* wet-vs-dry brightness/saturation is dominated by the paint CONTENT, not the sheen. The sheen's own contribution (the per-texel `blit − canvas` delta, partitioned by wetness) isolates it: assert the sheen darkens+saturates wet and lightens+mutes dry, plus a max-luma-boost gloss catch-light. (A test that asserted absolute "wet darker than dry" was measuring the paint content, not the sheen.)

**M7-round-4 (Matt 2026-06-09: "the rings appear ~1 s after the line and then fade — they were displaced, not removed"). The rings were never only in the line geometry — they are the SHEEN amplifying the WETNESS age-bands:**

- **A read-time sheen will turn the wetness AGE structure into CONCENTRIC RINGS — blur the wetness it reads.** On an accumulating canvas, a looping/spiralling painter lays overlapping passes at progressively different AGES; each pass's wetness decays separately, so a solid-looking stroke actually has a finely-banded wetness map. The sheen renders those bands as luminance rings — and **only ~1 s after laying**, once the wetness has decayed into the steep part of the wet→dry gate (where tiny age differences become visible steps), then they fade as it dries fully. This is why fixing the line *geometry* (the union SDF) did NOT remove them — the rings live in the wetness, not the geometry. Fix: **spatially blur the wetness before the sheen reads it** (a ~±10-texel two-ring Gaussian — radius ≈ the loop-pass spacing) so the per-pass bands blend into one smooth wet region, plus a **near-linear wet→dry gate** (`smoothstep(0.05, 0.95)`, not a steep `(0.30, 0.72)`) so what bands survive aren't amplified. The large-scale wet→dry boundary (the actual wet-now/dry-past read) is preserved.

- **A transient artifact needs a MAX-over-frames metric, not a single frame.** The rings only appear in the ~1 s transition window at a loop, so a single contact-sheet frame misses them (the headless final frame looked clean while the live continuous painting rang constantly). The gate: drive real stems, capture the BLIT + CANVAS at MANY checkpoints, and at SMOOTH-INTERIOR painted texels (canvas locally uniform — gate out edges/droplets) measure the local luminance RANGE the sheen ADDS in the blit; take the **max over all checkpoints**. Validated by A/B revert: 27.6 (rings) → 8.5 (blurred). Without a metric like this you cannot tell a "fix" from a displacement — the rings had already survived two geometry "fixes" precisely because nothing measured them.

### 18.10 Mood / structure / anticipation on a lossless canvas (Skein.5, D-152)

The canvas-hold invariant ("paint lands and never moves") constrains WHERE musicality modulation may enter. Three placement rules, each learned by construction at Skein.5:

- **Anything per-frame that displaces drawn positions smears.** The pour tail is recomputed closed-form every frame; a per-frame positional offset repaints the whole tail shifted → ghosting. Two safe channels exist: (a) **τ-warping** — modulate the painter-clock RATE, never the position; every tail sample stays exactly ON the trajectory curve (samples slide along the curve, never laterally), so wind-up/flick anticipation (`1 − 0.45·smoothstep(0.70, 1, beat_phase01)` + a 90 ms flick release at the wrap) cannot smear, by construction; (b) **pour-start offsets** — captured once per breakpoint and frozen (the D-150 jump mechanism), the channel the structural region lean rides. If a new modulation idea fits neither channel, it moves laid paint — redesign it.
- **Mood tints at LAY TIME, frozen.** Tint the LINEAR palette colour at the moment a breakpoint/burst is pushed (multiplicative warm/cool ±18 % R / ∓16 % B + saturation-around-luma with a 0.85 floor — never `mix(cream, hue, sat)`), and the lossless hold turns the mood into an ARCHIVE: the finished canvas shows the song's emotional arc in its layers. Tinting at READ time would repaint history every frame — the opposite read. Identity at valence 0 keeps silence + all earlier gates byte-identical.
- **Display-only adornments live in the comp fragment, never the overlay.** The overlay BAKES (that is its job); the comp is the only non-persistent surface (FA #70). The Skein.5 locus binds the slot-6 preset buffer at blit fragment buffer 1 via a gated `bindCompStagePresetBuffer` (inert for every other preset — the ENGINE.2 precedent). A luminous point over a CREAM ground needs an occlusion shadow ring to read ("hovering" = it casts one); warm-white alone vanishes on cream.

Confidence-gate structure bias to exactly zero below the gate (smoothstep 0.25→0.55 on `StructuralPrediction.confidence`) — ambient/unpredictable material must keep the pure allover read, and "exactly zero" is testable (`conf 0.05 ⇒ pulse 0, lean 0, breaks +0`). Density-flurry proofs need IDENTICAL tiled audio either side of the injected boundary, or the music explains the density change, not the pulse.

**§18.10 addendum (Skein.5.1 — the painter never pours white).** Three rules from the M7 round on session `2026-06-09T22-35-09Z`: (1) **a "neutral" placeholder colour on a lossless canvas is never neutral** — the white-baseline pour baked a permanent tail-length white squiggle at every canvas birth (most of the 40-sample tail, including negative-ctau samples, resolved to the baseline era); on a canvas that archives everything, scaffolding colours become permanent content. The fix shape: draw NOTHING until the first real pour commits, then retro-colour the pre-commit window (`tauStart = 0`) — the retro-colour makes a commit DELAY visually free, which enables (2) **a settle before the first commit** (`firstPourSettleTau` 0.25 τ): the first pour's colour comes from ~¼ s of smoothed evidence instead of one frame's argmax (D-150 decisiveness at canvas birth; the one-frame argmax reliably picked a flicker stem). (3) **The painter clock pauses at true silence** (`activity` gate on paint speed, the wetness-pause semantics) — pause/track-gap freezes the painter; the FV-energy term keeps the clock running during the stems-converging window when music is clearly playing. Test surface: white-presence inverts from a positive to a NEGATIVE gate; silence gates assert `painted == 0`; line-isolation fixtures use CALM real frames (all per-stem devs below the onset threshold) so the pour line exists without splatter.

**§18.8 addendum (Skein.5.3 — the palette library, D-155).** Multiple palettes on a stem-coloured preset only stay legible if the ROLE GRAMMAR is fixed across the library (drums = darkest ink, bass = deep weight, vocals = warm lead, other = contrast accent) — hues may change per track, the grammar may not. Curation is mechanical, not vibes: every entry must hold pairwise display-level separation (including vs the canvas ground) across the FULL mood-tint swing, because the tint is applied at lay time — test with the exact production transform (`SkeinState.moodTint`), not a re-derivation. Palette selection is part of the determinism contract: the track seed picks the palette (`seed % count`), so "same song → same painting" extends to colour. Keep index 0 = the shipped default so seed-0 fixtures stay byte-identical, and engage library mode only when no explicit palette is injected — fixtures and contact-sheet candidates stay pinned by construction.
