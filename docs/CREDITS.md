## BeatNet — beat / downbeat tracking (FORMERLY USED — no longer bundled)

**Status:** Removed. Phase DSP.2 pivoted from BeatNet to Beat This! (D-077, 2026-05-04).
The vendored weights (`UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/Weights/beatnet/`) were deleted in
commit `f1788401`, and the derived converter (`Scripts/convert_beatnet_weights.py`) in
the D-163 follow-up (2026-06-14). **No BeatNet-derived material ships in Uzume.** The
notice below is retained as a historical acknowledgment, not a live CC-BY redistribution
obligation.

Filtering for Online Joint Beat, Downbeat, and Meter Tracking.* ISMIR 2021.
**Repository:** https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet — **License:** CC-BY-4.0. While in use,
the GTZAN-trained `model_1_weights.pt` was re-encoded (PyTorch state_dict → per-tensor
`.bin` + JSON manifest, byte-identical after endianness normalization; no retraining).

**Modifications:** PyTorch Lightning checkpoint re-encoded to one `.bin`
file per tensor + `manifest.json`. Five training-only `num_batches_tracked`
int64 buffers omitted (not used at inference). All float32 tensor values
are byte-identical to the source after endianness normalization. No
retraining or fine-tuning.

## Milkdrop-inspired preset attribution

**Status:** **Active — populated per D-111 (as amended by the D-113
inspired-by reframe).** Eight presets are Milkdrop-inspired works; each
declares its source in an `inspired_by` sidecar block. (`Meniscus` is the
newest and is not yet certified — MEN.2a.)

**Source pack:**
[`projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop`](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop)
— a curated collection of 9,795 Milkdrop presets compiled by ISOSCELES
and adopted as the default preset pack for projectM releases since
2022. Original pack release:
[https://www.patreon.com/posts/pack-nestdrop-91682111](https://www.patreon.com/posts/pack-nestdrop-91682111).
The ports were authored against the pre-converted **butterchurn
built-ins** ([`jberg/butterchurn`](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn)
/ `butterchurn-presets`, MIT-licensed WebGL Milkdrop port) rendered as
live oracles — see `tools/milkdrop-render/`.

**License posture:** Per the pack's `LICENSE.md`, Milkdrop presets
were "in almost all cases, not released under any specific license";
preset authors retain individual copyright, but the pack curator
asserts public-domain-by-convention based on two decades of free
release and ubiquitous reuse across projectM-derived applications.
The pack supports a takedown path: preset authors can contact the
projectM team to have their preset removed from future releases.
Uzume commits to honoring takedown requests routed via that path.
No `.milk` file is redistributed in this repository (D-111 scope
condition; Dragon Bloom's reference copy was removed at PUB.1 — its
SHA-256 is retained in the sidecar as provenance).

**Per-preset attribution (`inspired_by` sidecar block, D-111 as amended; schema
normalised across all seven sidecars at MD.0 / D-215 §13.3):**

```json
"inspired_by": {
  "milkdrop_filename": "<source preset name as it appears in the gallery>",
  "original_artist": "<best-effort from the filename pattern>",
  "pack": "projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop",
  "source_form": "<what was actually read — butterchurn built-in JSON | .milk>",
  "sha256": "<hash of that artifact; omitted where none was taken, with source_form saying why>"
}
```

`sha256` is the hash of the source artifact **actually read**, and `source_form`
names what that artifact was — the two fields are read together. Six of the
eight were authored against a **butterchurn built-in JSON** rendered as a live
oracle through `tools/milkdrop-render/`; only Dragon Bloom read a `.milk`.
Where no hash was taken at authoring, `sha256` is omitted rather than invented.

| Uzume preset (`.metal` / `.json`) | Source preset | Original author (best-effort) | Source form | Certified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DragonBloom` | `$$$ Royal - Mashup (220)` | $$$ Royal mashup series (multiple component authors) | `.milk` (hashed; copy removed at PUB.1) | ✅ |
| `FataMorgana` | `martin [shadow harlequins shape code] - fata morgana` | Martin | butterchurn built-in JSON (no hash taken) | ✅ |
| `Nacre` | `$$$ Royal - Mashup (431)` | $$$ Royal mashup series (multiple component authors) | butterchurn built-in JSON (no hash taken) | ✅ |
| `Glaze` | `Flexi + stahlregen - jelly showoff parade` | Flexi, stahlregen | butterchurn built-in JSON (no hash taken) | ✅ |
| `Floret` | `suksma - Rovastar - Sunflower Passion (Enlightment Mix)_Phat_edit + flexi und martin shaders - circumflex in character classes in regular expression` | suksma, Rovastar, Flexi, Martin | butterchurn built-in JSON (no hash taken) | ✅ |

**Modifications:** These are **inspired-by works, not ports of record**
(D-113): each is authored from scratch on Uzume's primitives
(`mv_warp` + custom Metal shaders), reproduces the source's visual
character against a live butterchurn oracle, and then adds Uzume's
music coupling — deviation primitives (D-026), stem-driven routing,
beat-grid/downbeat events, and (Nacre) the Tonal Interval Vector
palette. No Milkdrop runtime, `.milk` parser, or transpiled shader
text ships in Uzume.

## Open-Unmix HQ — stem separation weights

**Used in:** `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/Weights/` (vendored weights
for `vocals`, `drums`, `bass`, `other`).

**Source:** Fabian-Robert Stöter, Stefan Uhlich, Antoine Liutkus,
Yuki Mitsufuji. *Open-Unmix — A Reference Implementation for Music
Source Separation.* Journal of Open Source Software, 2019.

**Repository:** https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch

**License:** MIT (code) — model weights distributed under the same
permissive terms via `umxhq` package on PyPI / Zenodo.

**Modifications:** PyTorch state_dict → flat `.bin` per-tensor with
JSON manifest for MPSGraph inference (mirrors the BeatNet treatment
above). BatchNorm folded into the preceding linear layer at
MPSGraph init time, not at conversion.

---

## PANNs MobileNetV1 — instrument-family activity weights

**Used in:** `UzumeEngine/Sources/ML/Weights/panns_mobilenetv1/`
(vendored AudioSet 527-class audio-tagger weights). Uzume runs the
tagger over the 30 s preview clip to derive per-family instrument
activity (strings / brass / woodwinds / percussion) for orchestral
presets (IFC / D-177).

**Source:** Qiuqiang Kong, Yin Cao, Turab Iqbal, Yuxuan Wang, Wenwu
Wang, Mark D. Plumbley. *PANNs: Large-Scale Pretrained Audio Neural
Networks for Audio Pattern Recognition.* IEEE/ACM TASLP, 2020.

**Repository:** https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn

**Weights:** `MobileNetV1_mAP=0.389.pth`, Zenodo record 3987831 —
**License: CC-BY-4.0.** **Model-definition code:** MIT (the repository
above) — reimplemented for MPSGraph, not vendored.

**AudioSet ontology** (the 527-class label set the tagger predicts):
Google, **CC-BY-4.0** — https://research.google.com/audioset/

**Modifications:** PyTorch `.pth` → flat `.bin` per-tensor with JSON
manifest for MPSGraph inference (mirrors the Open-Unmix / Beat This!
treatment). The torchlibrosa STFT basis and librosa mel filterbank are
exported from the checkpoint and run as exact matmuls in the Swift
front-end. BatchNorm folded at MPSGraph init time.

## App icon — "First Opening" (first-party, from the brand repository)

**Source of truth:** [`hoaxpoet/uzume-site`](https://github.com/hoaxpoet/uzume-site)
— `brand/icon/Uzume.iconset/`, produced in that repo's BRAND.1 increment and
selected by Matt ("First Opening wins"). Brand rules live in its `BRAND.md`;
the artifact inventory and licences in its `ARTIFACTS.md`.

**What is installed here:** the ten PNGs in
`UzumeApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` are **byte-identical** (SHA-256)
to the approved iconset — installed at RN.1, verified at RN.3. There is no
re-export, crop, or recolour between the approved master and the shipped
`Uzume.app`. `BRAND.md` forbids recolouring, sharpening, adding type or glow,
flattening the spectrum, and monochrome substitutes.

**Do not regenerate the icon in this repository.** Change it in `uzume-site`,
re-export there, and copy the iconset across; then re-run the checksum
comparison in that repo's `ARTIFACTS.md` §RN.1 handoff.

The `.icns` container and the favicon set are deliberately **not** vendored
here: macOS builds the icon from the asset catalogue, and the app has no web
surface.

Fonts (Alumni Sans, PT Sans — both SIL OFL 1.1) are brand-repo assets used for
the wordmark; the application itself ships neither as a bundled resource.

## Other dependencies

System frameworks (Apple): Metal, MetalKit, MetalPerformanceShadersGraph,
AVFoundation, Accelerate, ScreenCaptureKit, MusicKit. Used under the
terms granted by Apple to macOS developers; no separate attribution
required.

If you ship a derivative of Uzume, you must:

1. Preserve the MIT notice in `LICENSE` and the Beat This! MIT notice
   in this file. (BeatNet is no longer bundled — its CC-BY section above
   is a historical note, not a live obligation.)
1a. Preserve the CC-BY-4.0 attribution for the PANNs MobileNetV1 weights
   (Kong et al., Zenodo 3987831) and the AudioSet ontology — both are
   live CC-BY redistribution obligations.
2. Make this `CREDITS.md` (or an equivalent compilation of the
   notices) reachable from a user-visible surface — e.g. an "About"
   panel — alongside license text or hyperlinks.
3. Note any modifications you make to the bundled weights.

Open an issue if you spot a missing attribution.
