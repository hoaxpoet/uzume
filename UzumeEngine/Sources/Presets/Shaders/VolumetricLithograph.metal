// VolumetricLithograph.metal — Psychedelic linocut-inspired terrain landscape.
//
// An infinite, slowly morphing audio-reactive landscape rendered with a
// printmaking aesthetic: bimodal materials separated by a razor-sharp
// ridge-line, with saturated metallic peaks that cycle through a Quilez
// cosine palette over time + valence + spatial position.  Drum onsets
// flare the peak palette into HDR bloom; the ridge-line itself reads as
// a thin emissive seam where the cut goes.
//
// CSP.4 audit (2026-05-28) — no code change.
//
//   Following BUG-019's close (PERF.3 + CSP.3.2/3/4 fixed FFO's three
//   antipatterns: beat-dominant lighting, deviation-primitive dead zone,
//   SDF Lipschitz overshoot), CSP.4 audited VL for the same shapes.
//
//   Result: VL is structurally clean of all three.
//     • Depth driver `vocalSwell` reads `stems.vocals_energy` (AGC stem,
//       not deviation — measured mean 0.33–0.36 on Love Rehab + Money,
//       well above the 0.1 floor).  FV warmup fallback `f.mid_att_rel`
//       is a deviation primitive but is only consumed for the first
//       ~10 s before stems arrive — narrow window, accepted trade.
//     • Peak lift `kickPulse` reads drum-stem `drums_beat` / `drums_attack_ratio`
//       (MIR-invariant) / `drums_energy` (AGC stem).  No deviation
//       primitive in the warm-state primary path.
//     • Camera dolly is bass-continuous: `baseSpeed × (0.5 + features.bass × 1.1)`
//       in RenderPipeline+RayMarch.swift:213 — already the post-CSP.3.2
//       Layer-1-primary shape.
//     • Engine light intensity inherits PERF.3 (`1.0 + bass × 0.4 +
//       beatAccent × 0.15`) automatically through `applyAudioModulation`.
//     • SDF Lipschitz: `VL_SDF_STEP_SCALE = 0.6` (effective divisor 1.67).
//       VL's broader low-frequency noise (`VL_NOISE_FREQUENCY = 0.12`)
//       keeps gradients well within budget; no overshoot artifacts
//       reported in the 2026-05-28T17-16-36Z M7 (Matt's "other ray-march
//       presets unchanged" verification).
//     • FA #4 (beat-dominant) check: typical peak frame beat:base ratio
//       1.47×, borderline-low against CLAUDE.md's 2–4× guideline, BUT
//       peak lift only modulates the above-midpoint region (asymmetric)
//       and the kick gate fires <30 % of frames.  On average continuous
//       dominates by >3×.  Not a true FA #4 violation; this is the v9.3
//       intentional "kick-prominent on bass-only sections" design.
//
//   The pre-CSP.4 audit narrative (v6 → v9.4) below remains as design
//   history.  Stems-routing dead-zone risk is structurally avoided by
//   reading AGC stem energies and MIR-invariant ratios directly, not
//   their deviation primitives.
//
// v9 — Explicit per-stem routing: drums→pulse, vocals→depth (2026-04-17,
//   session 2026-04-17T22-42-15Z).  Matt's observations on bad guy:
//
//     "The best synchronization is with the darker valleys, which move
//      deeper with Billie Eilish's voice.  The pulsing terrain is a bit
//      too overstimulated and could probably react to just the kick."
//
//   Data analysis of the session confirmed:
//     • Vocals leads the song's dynamic envelope (avg 0.37, highest
//       variance 0.023) — its coincidental contribution through
//       intensity was what produced the "valleys move with voice" read.
//     • Only `stems.drums_beat` has a live beat signal (per-stem beat
//       detector architecture — other stems' `_beat` fields stay 0).
//     • `f.beat_composite` (v8.2's pulse source) fires on vocal
//       transients, mid-band attacks AND kicks — the overstimulation.
//
//   v9 mapping (explicit):
//     Kick pulse (peak lift):  max(stems.drums_beat, f.beat_bass × 0.8),
//                              thresholded smoothstep(0.20, 0.70).
//                              Restricted to kick-character signals;
//                              f.beat_bass fallback covers bass-driven
//                              tracks (Slint) where drums stem is empty.
//     Vocal depth:             stems.vocals_energy (fast-follow) →
//                              adds VL_VOCAL_DEPTH_BOOST × swell to
//                              audioAmp.  Deeper valleys with vocal
//                              phrasing, intentional rather than
//                              accidental.  FV fallback: f.mid_att_rel.
//     Continuous intensity:    coact + log(1+density) + 0.25·(AR-1)
//                              (retained for section-scale swell).
//     Palette hue:              unchanged (energy-weighted stem mean).
//     Peak polish:              unchanged (onset density).
//     Bass sustain:             REMOVED from peak lift (user: "just the
//                              kick").  Bass now contributes only via
//                              coactivation and density in intensity.
//
// v8.2 — Sync-drift fixes: thresholded beat pulse + bass sustain + beefier
//   FV fallback (2026-04-17, session 2026-04-17T22-29-43Z).  Matt's
//   observation on bad guy was a specific pattern: "not synced at start,
//   synced at 5-6s, drifts out, re-syncs approaching chorus."  Data
//   confirmed three causes:
//
//   (1) f.beat_composite is noisy during active music — values span
//       0.22 to 1.00 across frames within a single bar.  Using the raw
//       value as the pulse amplitude meant weak detector reads (0.3-0.5)
//       produced subtle bumps that didn't carry sync; only the full
//       pulses (0.9-1.0) were visible.  v8.2 thresholds via
//       smoothstep(0.30, 0.85) so only real hits register, and the
//       peak lift constant is increased to compensate.
//
//   (2) Sustained 808/sub-bass verses (bad guy 0:04-0:21) have few
//       rising-edge onsets — the detector sees a held bass note as
//       one flux spike, not a rhythm.  Added a separate `bassSustain`
//       term driven by f.bass_att (IIR-smoothed bass band) that feeds
//       into the same peak-lift path.  Keeps terrain visibly alive
//       during sustained bass-forward sections even between discrete
//       onsets.
//
//   (3) Pre-stem FV fallback was structurally weaker than post-stem
//       intensity (max ~1.1 vs max ~2.5), producing a visible
//       response-strength jump at ~10s when stems arrived.  FV path
//       now scales band deviations more aggressively and adds a
//       continuous bass_att floor, matching post-stem range.
//
// v8 — Asymmetric peak-lift beat pulse + wider depth range (2026-04-17).
//   Matt feedback on v7: the linear `audioAmp += beatPulse × 0.6` added
//   the pulse to the *entire* terrain amplitude, which multiplies both
//   sides of the (n − 0.5) midpoint — so peaks lift AND valleys drop on
//   each onset, in equal measure.  That reads as the whole terrain
//   vertically stretching (a breathing squish) rather than as rhythmic
//   motion.  Visually subtle, not what a "pulse" should feel like.
//
//   v8 splits the pulse out of `audioAmp` and applies it only to the
//   above-midpoint region in `vl_heightAt`:
//
//     peakLift = beatPulse × max(0, n − 0.5) × 2 × VL_BEAT_PEAK_LIFT
//     h       = base + peakLift
//
//   Asymmetric: valleys stay at their continuous-intensity floor while
//   peaks reach *up* on each onset and relax back (beat_composite decays
//   ~200 ms to 0.1).  Reads as "tall peaks reaching toward the sky on
//   every beat" rather than "whole terrain squishing."
//
//   Also widens the continuous depth range to make intensity differences
//   dramatic rather than subtle:
//     VL_DISP_SILENT_AMP  0.6 → 0.4  (lower resting floor)
//     VL_DISP_AUDIO_AMP   1.4 → 2.2  (steeper intensity response)
//     Silent terrain: peaks at ~0.4 units.  Dense section: peaks at ~5.
//     10× depth swing between silent and dense; clearly perceptible.
//
//   Reference tracks for future testing (modern loud-mastered, peaks
//   within 1 dB of full scale): Billie Eilish "bad guy", Taylor Swift
//   "Anti-Hero", The Weeknd "Blinding Lights", Dua Lipa "Levitating",
//   Post Malone "Sunflower".  Dynamic-range references (still loud-
//   mastered on streaming but with wider quiet-to-loud internal range):
//   Steely Dan "Aja", Pink Floyd "Time".
//
// v7 — Beat-synced terrain pulse via `f.beat_composite` (2026-04-17,
//   session 2026-04-17T20-16-31Z).  Matt observed that Slint's "Good
//   Morning, Captain" is bass-and-guitar-driven (no kick propelling
//   the verse), so a drum-centric rhythm driver gets the synchronization
//   wrong.  v7 replaces the drum-stem beat + stem-specific intensity
//   with `f.beat_composite` — the 6-band full-mix onset detector's
//   union signal, which fires on whichever band is currently rhythmic:
//   kick (sub_bass/low_bass), bass guitar pluck (low_bass), guitar
//   strum (low_mid), vocal attack (mid_high), cymbal (high).  Every
//   band has proper cooldowns so it doesn't flood on dense passages.
//
//   Changes:
//     audioAmp += f.beat_composite × 0.6  — terrain now visibly pulses
//       on each onset in addition to the continuous intensity swell.
//       Base:beat ratio ≈ 2.5:1 (CLAUDE.md guideline 2-4×).
//     accent = smoothstep(f.beat_composite)  — peak flare + ridge
//       strobe now fire on any rhythmic band, not only the drum stem.
//
//   The intensity driver (coact + density + attack) is retained for
//   the slow section-energy swell; it just no longer has to carry the
//   rhythm signal as well.
//
// v6.2 — Calibration tighten (see diff history):
//   • Coactivation thresholds [0.12, 0.30] → [0.28, 0.50].  Stem
//     separator leaks cross-material, so "active" requires genuine
//     above-baseline energy.  Sparse verses now score coact 0-1.
//   • Density log-compressed (log(1+density)) and baseline subtracted
//     so intensity truly floors at 0 in sparse sections.
//
// v6.1 — Recalibration + rhythm decoupling (2026-04-17, session
//   2026-04-17T19-31-46Z).  The v6 prototype shipped with two latent
//   issues surfaced on Slint "Good Morning, Captain":
//
//   (a) Onset rates were 20-25/sec across all stems (should be 1-8/sec),
//       saturating `density` and pinning intensity at clamp 2.5 for
//       the whole song — amp was effectively constant.  Root cause was
//       a missing rising-edge gate in the StemAnalyzer onset detector:
//       each sustained above-threshold signal registered 3-5 onsets per
//       hit.  Fixed at the source with rising-edge + 100ms refractory.
//
//   (b) Accent fired on `attack_ratio` across all four stems, so bass
//       onsets (often syncopated against the drum pattern) produced
//       extra off-beat flashes that read as arhythmic.  v6.1 locks the
//       accent to `drums_beat` only (which already has proper per-band
//       cooldowns from the drum-stem BeatDetector), with FV spectral-
//       flux fallback during stem warmup.
//
//   Intensity constants recalibrated for realistic post-fix rates:
//     intensity = 0.25·coact + 0.40·density + 0.20·(attack-1)
//
// v6 — Density/rate/attack drivers (2026-04-17, session 2026-04-17T18-28-01Z).
// v5 depended on per-stem deviation (`*_energy_dev`) to drive terrain amp.
// Diagnostic showed this failed on Slint — Good Morning, Captain: the
// screamed-vocal outro is ~4× louder acoustically than the bass-only
// verse, but post-AGC normalised energies were 0.45 vs 0.20 (≈2.3×), and
// dev values dropped back near zero during the sustained outro as the
// per-stem EMA (decay 0.995, τ≈2s) caught up to the new loudness.  The
// visualiser read the outro and the verse as the same intensity.
//
// v6 pivots to three primitives that survive per-stem AGC because they
// measure the *structure* of activity rather than its amplitude:
//
//   1. Coactivation count — how many stems are simultaneously active
//      (soft count via smoothstep on raw energies).  Verse has 1
//      active stem; outro has all 4.  AGC compresses amplitude but
//      cannot make a silent stem appear active.
//
//   2. Onset rate (MV-3a, events/sec, ~0.5s leaky integrator) — how
//      fast onsets are firing.  Outro has dense kicks + strummed
//      guitar onsets at ~3-5 events/sec; verse has sparse plucks.
//      Rate is unaffected by AGC gain.
//
//   3. Attack ratio (MV-3a, fastRMS(50ms)/slowRMS(500ms), clamped [0,3])
//      — how transient the sharpest stem currently is.  Screamed
//      vocals and hard drum hits have ratio ≫ 1; sustained pads ~1.
//      A fast-over-slow RMS ratio is gain-invariant by construction.
//
// Combined: intensity = 0.30·coact + 0.50·density + 0.25·(attack−1)
//
// Rough target ranges:
//   Silence          → 0
//   Solo-bass verse  → coact≈1, dens≈0.3, attack≈1.2  →  ~0.6
//   Full-band verse  → coact≈2.5, dens≈0.6, attack≈1.5 →  ~1.2
//   Dense outro      → coact≈4, dens≈1.2, attack≈2.5  →  ~2.2
//
// Hue driver: energy-weighted mean across per-stem hue positions (bass
// warm, drums violet, vocals teal, other yellow).  v5 used dev-weighted
// but that collapsed numerically when all devs decayed; energy-weighted
// blends stems by current mix contribution, which is what "dominant
// stem shifts palette" should measure anyway.
//
// Accent: max(drums_beat, smoothstep(attack−1)) — fires on any stem's
// sharp transient, not only the drum-stem onset detector.
//
// MV-1 FV fallbacks retained for warmup (smoothstep(0.02, 0.06, total)).
//
// v4 (session 2026-04-16T20-09-44Z — tested on Tea Lights, Lower Dens,
// an acoustic/electric guitar driven track at ~75 BPM with no kick drum):
// previous iterations were all bass-band-centric and totally failed on
// non-percussive music.  v4 redesigns drivers to be genre-agnostic:
//   - sceneSDF audioAmp: melody-primary blend.  f.mid_att (250-4000 Hz)
//     covers guitar/vocals/synths at ×15 (compensates per-band AGC).
//     f.bass_att retained as secondary (×1.2) so bass-driven tracks still
//     get sub-swell.  Weighted 0.75 melody + 0.35 bass.
//   - sceneMaterial accent: f.spectral_flux (any timbral attack — kicks,
//     guitar strums, vocal onsets, piano chord changes) replaces the
//     bass-keyed drumsBeatFB.  smoothstep(0.35, 0.70) based on Tea Lights
//     distribution (mean 0.47, p90 0.69).
//   - Palette phase now adds f.mid_att × 3.0 so colour rotates with
//     melodic phrasing, not only accumulated audio time.
//   - Paired with forward camera dolly (1.8 u/s, enabled in
//     VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift) so scene CHANGE comes from spatial
//     motion, not only vertical pulsing.  Amplitude reduced 1.8 → 1.4
//     because tall peaks look dramatic on horizon but awkward close-up
//     when dollying past.  Flares toned down (×1.5 → ×0.8 peak, ×2.0 →
//     ×1.0 ridge, 0.03 → 0.02 coverage shift) to match ambient motion.
//
// v3.4 (session 2026-04-16T18-56-59Z — Matt flagged "still out of sync,
// and sharper/less smooth"):  Data analysis exposed that v3.3's
// smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass) missed half the kicks (many Love Rehab
// kicks peak at 0.20-0.23 in f.bass, below the 0.22 threshold), producing
// a phantom 65 BPM rhythm — half the actual 125 BPM kick.  The narrow
// smoothstep range also gave near-binary 0→1 transitions, explaining the
// "sharp" character.  v3.4 switches to f.bass_att (the 0.95-smoothed bass
// band): (a) its local maxima track real kicks at 127 BPM (within 2% of
// target), (b) it's already smooth so no sharpening artefacts, (c) it
// catches every kick via smoothing (no threshold-miss issue).  Single
// smooth driver for both sceneSDF audioAmp and sceneMaterial drumsBeatFB.
//
// v3.3 (session 2026-04-16T18-44-45Z — Matt flagged beat not syncing to
// the driving kick):  Data revealed that f.beat_bass was firing at
// 143 BPM on a 125 BPM track — the 400ms cooldown in the 6-band onset
// detector phase-locks beat_bass to the cooldown itself when the track
// has dense off-kick bass content (like Love Rehab's syncopated
// bassline).  f.bass local-maxima analysis showed the real kick rhythm
// is cleanly readable from the continuous bass energy (508ms intervals,
// matching 125 BPM).  v3.3 switches all beat-aligned drivers to use
// smoothstep(0.22, 0.32, f.bass) instead of f.beat_bass:
//   - Terrain kick in sceneSDF: smoothstep × 0.40 (up from 0.35, since
//     smoothstep has a smoother shape than the sharp beat_bass pulse).
//   - drumsBeatFB in sceneMaterial: direct smoothstep output.
//   - Removed 0.4 * f.mid_att from slowAmp: mid had ~4.6 onsets/sec on
//     Love Rehab (hi-hat/clap), which leaked a non-kick rhythm into
//     terrain amplitude.  bass_att alone tracks the kick.
//
// v3.2 (session 2026-04-16T18-24-43Z — Matt flagged "pulsing faster than
// the beat" and "neutral gray backdrop"):
//   - Peak coverage was ~35% because lo=0.50 sat at the fbm mean.  Raised
//     lo/hi to 0.56/0.60 so peaks are ~15% of the scene — restores the
//     linocut "highlights on mostly-dark paper" feel and quiets the
//     visual field so beat-aligned motion can dominate.
//   - Noise time scale 0.06 → 0.015: high-octave fbm shimmer was drifting
//     fast enough to read as continuous "pulses" that weren't beat-locked.
//     4× slower ties the surface detail down so beat flares stand out.
//   - Palette rotation 0.15 → 0.08: ~one full colour cycle per preset
//     duration at moderate energy (was pulse-rate at 0.15).
//   - Shared RayMarch.metal fix: miss/sky pixels now tinted by
//     scene.lightColor.rgb (matches fog-colour treatment) — no more
//     "neutral gray backdrop" on presets with warm light colour.
//
// v3.1 (session 2026-04-16T17-33-10Z v2 diagnostic) tuned three palette
// parameters that v3 left untouched but the data showed were wrong:
//   - Palette rotation rate 0.04 → 0.15:  over 64s of playback, audioTime
//     accumulated only to 5.0 units so the palette rotated 20% of a cycle
//     total.  0.15 gives one full rotation per ~7s of active audio.
//   - Spatial hue spread 0.45 → 0.9:  peak noise range is [0.55, 1.0], so
//     0.45 contribution capped at 0.20 — all peaks in a frame looked the
//     same hue.  0.9 doubles per-peak variation.
//   - Valley brightness 0.08 → 0.15:  v3 valleys were so dim the
//     valence-tinted IBL ambient dominated and they read as uniform dark
//     brown.  0.15 lets the complementary palette colour register.
//
// v3 design rationale (session 2026-04-16T16-44-51Z + v2 visual review):
//   v2 (palette + calmer motion) over-corrected — beat response was
//   inert on energetic music, and scene_fog=0 actually produced MAX
//   fog due to a bug in the shared `makeSceneUniforms` fallback.  v3:
//   - Fixed shared helper so `scene_fog: 0` truly disables fog.
//   - Rebalanced beat response: `pow(f.beat_bass, 1.2) * 1.5` replaces
//     v2's `pow(1.5) * 0.7`; palette flare × 1.5 (was × 0.6); ridge
//     strobe × (1.4 + beat × 2.0); added 0.03 coverage-expansion shift
//     (v1 was 0.18 which flickered; v2 was 0 which was dead).
//   - Added a small transient kick to terrain amplitude in sceneSDF
//     (`f.beat_bass * 0.35`) so the landscape breathes on kicks.
// v2 changes preserved:
//   - Attenuated bands (`f.bass_att + 0.4 * f.mid_att`) for slow-flowing
//     baseline amplitude (not the primary driver v1 had).
//   - IQ cosine palette from ShaderUtilities.metal:576 drives peak
//     albedo by noise position + audio time + valence.
//   - `sqrt(f.mid) * 1.6` replaces `f.treble * 1.4` for "other" polish.
//
// Audio routing (v9.4 current — corrects the stale v9.2 summary that
// described drivers v9.3 had removed):
//   s.sceneParamsA.x                                          → terrain phase
//   stems.vocals_energy × 0.7 (vocalSwell ONLY)               → continuous depth amp

// SCOPE (design doc §Open-decisions #1, Matt 2026-07-23): only the operators
// VL actually calls are ported, not the whole library. FA #73 is satisfied by
// porting these VERBATIM rather than deriving them; vendoring ~40 operators
// for two call sites is not. The RENDERER "SDF authoring" capability flip

//     negative Z, so this is not theoretical.                  (gotcha #3)
