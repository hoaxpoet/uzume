// PlaybackActionRouter — Protocol declaring the keyboard-surface live-adaptation actions.
//
// Lives in the Orchestrator module so the contract is defined alongside the types it
// will eventually manipulate (DefaultPresetScorer, DefaultLiveAdapter, DefaultSessionPlanner).
// Concrete implementations live in the app layer (DefaultPlaybackActionRouter).
//
// U.6: all implementations are stubs that log TODO(U.6b) markers.
// U.6b: full semantics — boost family weight, exclude family, nudge at boundary, etc.
//
// Threading: all methods are @MainActor. The router runs on the main thread and may
// dispatch work to background queues as needed by U.6b implementations.
