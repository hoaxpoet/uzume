// BeatPulseClock — FBS Stage 1: the steady, first-note-anchored, tempo-locked
// beat pulse (D-153).
//
// Produces the `pulsePhase01` / `pulseAmp01` FeatureVector fields that drive
// Ferrofluid Ocean's per-beat spike punch. Design contract (FBS kickoff +
// Stage 0 findings, docs/diagnostics/FBS_STAGE0_FINDINGS_2026-06-09.md):
//
//  1. ANCHOR = the first NOTE (silence → sustained sound), not the first
//     strong hit. Music starts on the "one"; the silence→signal transition is
//     the cleanest event in the take to detect, and unlike a strength
//     threshold it is not fooled by a quiet/building intro (Matt's
//     correction, 2026-06-09, verified: a first-note-anchored pulse lands
//     within ~28 ms of the beat on the measured catalog, beating the cached
//     grid's cross-capture-unstable phase at +60…+240 ms).
//  2. TEMPO = the pre-analysed cached BeatGrid BPM (Stage 0: reliable to
//     ~1 % and reproducible across captures — the one trustworthy part of
//     the grid).
//  3. DEAD STEADY — phase is `frac((t − anchor) / period)` and is NEVER
//     corrected afterwards. Explicitly does NOT consume
//     `LiveBeatDriftTracker` (its correction wanders 50–90 ms over the
//     opening — Stage 0; chasing it reads as the visual "searching").
//     A steady pulse that is wrong-by-a-hair beats a wandering pulse that is
//     right-on-average. Stage 3 may add a bar-boundary handoff; Stage 1
//     must not.
//
// Amplitude (`amp01`) is a music-present gate only in Stage 1: 0 before the
// anchor, 1 while audio flows, fading to 0 across sustained silence (an
// inter-track gap or a stop — NOT a between-beat dip) so the pulse never
// punches into a silent room. Stage 2 will modulate it by live energy.
//
// SLOW PULSE (Matt's direction 2026-06-10, D-154): the pulse period is FOUR
// beats, not one. The Stage-1 live verdict (session 2026-06-10T03-02-32Z)
// showed a per-beat punch from an arbitrary phase reads as a robotic
// metronome ignoring the music — on a streaming playlist, tracks 2+ switch
// mid-audio so the first-note anchor lands on a musically meaningless
// instant. At 4-beat rate (~2 s at 120 BPM) the same phase error reads as a
// gentle oceanic heave at a musical rate rather than a wrong beat claim, and
// sub-1 % tempo error takes 4× longer to smear the phase. A fixed 4 beats is
// used (not the grid's detected meter — meter detection is itself unreliable
// and the pulse does not claim downbeat alignment).
//
// Deterministic: outputs are a pure function of the input series. No locks —
// all access happens on MIRPipeline's processing path plus its existing
// app-layer call sites, mirroring `BandDeviationTracker` / `BeatPredictor`.
