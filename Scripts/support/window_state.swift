// membership for any app. This is what the BUG-085 occlusion hypothesis needs, and the
// AppleScript route (which the capture script used first) is blocked unless the user grants
// Accessibility — so it recorded a permission error instead of the answer.
//
// EVERY off-screen window used to be labelled "this is the BUG-085 occlusion condition".
// On the 2026-08-05 freeze capture that printed the line EIGHT times — for the 1920x30 and
// 1080x30 MENU-BAR windows of secondary displays — while the actual render window was
// on-screen and composited. Read literally, the file confirmed a hypothesis that had already
// been experimentally refuted. A diagnostic that misleads is worse than one that stays quiet,
// so the verdict is now computed only for the RENDER window, and the rest are listed as
// context (menu bars, panels) without a verdict.
