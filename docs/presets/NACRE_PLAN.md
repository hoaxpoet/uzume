# Nacre — Preset Plan

**Status:** NACRE.1 ✅ + NACRE.2a ✅ + **NACRE.2b ✅ code-complete (faithful base, pending Matt's live M7)** — `[NACRE.2b]` commits. The faithful (431) jello-mirror character is ported onto a dedicated custom-warp+comp mv_warp branch; the 3 greenlit uplifts (stem routing / real iridescence+HDR / smooth-Voronoi) are deferred to NACRE.3+ (AFTER M7 confirms the base; FA #65). See **§10 NACRE.2b — what landed** below; D-171.
**Target:** faithful Uzume uplift of the Milkdrop preset `$$$ Royal - Mashup (431)` (butterchurn built-in; cream-of-the-crop legends).
**Substrate:** `direct + mv_warp` (same family as the certified Dragon Bloom / Fata Morgana).
**Scaffold:** Dragon Bloom (`DragonBloom.metal` / `.json` / `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest`). (Starburst → renamed Murmuration, no longer mv_warp.)
**References:** `docs/VISUAL_REFERENCES/nacre/` — `source_preset.json`, `source_shaders.txt` (the literal port artifact), `target_animated.gif`, three annotated stills.

> Discipline: this is a faithful port. The source shaders in `source_shaders.txt` are the thing to port, not a starting point to re-derive (FA #73 / #65). Adopt the reference's mechanics; adapt only context (audio routing → our deviation primitives, palette anchoring, scale). Render the actual `(431)` beside every Nacre iteration.

## NACRE.2 — Committed scope & architecture (revised 2026-06-25, post-greenlight)

> **⚠️ 2026-06-25 spec-alignment (Matt): the architecture below is SUPERSEDED on three points** by
> `docs/prompts/NACRE_2B_KICKOFF.md` §0.5 (which merges Matt's `ROYAL_MASHUP_431_KICKOFF` spec). 2a's
> choices to correct in 2b: (a) **custom `nacre_warp_fragment` + a 3-level blur pyramid on the Fata
> Morgana template** — NOT the shared decay warp / convention-only path (431's warp is custom: unsharp
> blur-pyramid + treble grain + 0.9 in-warp decay; the blur pyramid needs FM's renderer-wired
> `blurState`, so "no renderer edit" was incomplete); (b) **feedback HDR with 8-bit fallback** if it
> over-blooms; (c) **stand up a live butterchurn oracle** for per-layer comparison. The musical role,
> temporal contract, stem routing (§6), and "the look is a DISPLAY-stage comp transform" all still hold.
> **NACRE_2B_KICKOFF.md is the authoritative 2b guide.**

**Greenlit (Matt):** faithful (431) character base **+ three 2026 uplifts** (substantially exceed the 2003 original, like Dragon Bloom was "faithful + uplifted"):
1. **Stem-instrument routing** — vocals→luminous core; bass→cell swell + displacement-kick; drums→rim sparkle; harmonic *other*→refraction / iridescence shift. The doctrine win (each instrument visible); Dragon Bloom precedent.
2. **Real thin-film iridescence + HDR** — replace (431)'s 2-px chromatic-offset rims with genuine `iridescence()`/`fresnel()` (`Utilities/PBR/Fresnel.metal`, `Materials/Exotic.metal`, Ferrofluid — FA #65), hue driven by chroma/centroid; on `.rgba16Float` feedback (unclamped colour + bloom). The on-theme headliner (nacre = mother-of-pearl = thin-film). Most M7-iteration-prone.
3. **Smooth-Voronoi refractive cells** — replace (431)'s `sin(4·uv)` lattice with C¹ smooth Voronoi (`Utilities/Noise/Worley.metal` + `smin`, FA #64) for organic depth-stacked membranes.
*(Deferred to tuning stage: beat-grid-lock pulse + chroma-driven palette.)*

**Architecture (corrects §5's pass-map — the signature look is a DISPLAY-stage transform of the feedback, NOT the scene fragment):**
- **Feedback loop** — `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` (direct FeatureVector+stems): the drifting accumulated cell-field — dense cell-advection warp + slow roam; **mid→zoom**, **bass→displacement-kick** (D-026 primitives). Plain decay feedback via shared `mvWarp_fragment` (chromatic=0). `.rgba16Float` feedback.
- **Scene fragment** — `nacre_fragment` (buf 0/1/2/3): draws the additive **central core** (vocals→brightness, waveform→shape) that seeds the field.
- **Custom comp/blit** — `nacre_comp_fragment` (DISPLAY-ONLY, samples feedback `warpTex` at tex 0): the signature look — radial-pulse zoom + **luminance-emboss rims → real iridescence** (hue←chroma; *other*→shift) + **smooth-Voronoi refractive cells** + drums→sparkle + treble→grain. Reads `NacreUniforms` (time + audio/spectral drive, precomputed CPU-side) at buffer 1; texsize from `warpTex.get_width/height()`.

**Wiring is convention-based — NO `RenderPipeline+MVWarp.swift` edit (confirmed).** `PresetLoader.makeWarpPipelines` auto-selects `<prefix>_comp_fragment` / `<prefix>_warp_fragment` from the JSON `fragment_function` (else the shared fns); the standard `drawWithMVWarp` path already uses the per-preset `blitState` + `bindCompStagePresetBuffer` (unconditional; Skein precedent). Minimal change-set:
- NEW `Shaders/Nacre.metal` (`nacre_fragment` + `mvWarpPerFrame`/`mvWarpPerVertex` + `nacre_comp_fragment`) + `Shaders/Nacre.json`.
- NEW `Presets/Nacre/NacreState.swift` (`NacreUniforms` + per-frame `tick`→`writeToGPU`; lighter than SkeinState — no ring buffers).
- `PresetLoader.feedbackFormat`: add `if name == "Nacre" { return .rgba16Float }`.
- `VisualizerEngine+Presets.swift`: Nacre block (alloc `NacreState` + `setDirectPresetFragmentBuffer` + tick), mirroring Skein; `VisualizerEngine.swift`: `nacreState` property + reset.
- NEW `Tests/.../NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest.swift` (adapt DragonBloom's; env-gate `NACRE_MVWARP_DIAG=1`).

## 1. Musical role (the one-sentence rule)

Nacre's translucent refractive cell-field is the song's **harmonic body**: it **inflates and breathes with continuous mid-band energy** (cells swell on sustained chords/pads), **bass onsets jolt the whole field with a bounded displacement-kick** (a ripple crosses the lenses), **treble stipples the chromatic rims with sparkle**, and a **luminous central core pulses with the waveform** — so the viewer reads *sustained energy as swelling translucent volume* and *transients as ripples and sparkle across it*.

This routing is **inherited from the source**, not invented — `(431)`'s own per-frame equations already drive zoom from mid energy and kick displacement from a bass threshold (see §4), which happens to align with Uzume's Audio Data Hierarchy (continuous energy primary, beats as accents). That alignment is why this preset is low-risk.

## 2. Temporal contract (behaviour over time, not a still)

| When | What the field does |
|---|---|
| **Silence / warmup (D-019)** | Cell-field present and **alive** — slow time-driven roam + palette rotation continue; zoom at baseline; core dim-but-visible. Never black/frozen. |
| **Sustained mid energy** (held chord, build) | Cells **inflate** (zoom pumps up via an EMA-decay envelope), field grows over ~0.5–2 s, recedes slowly. |
| **Bass onset** | The field **lurches** — a bounded displacement-kick sends a ripple across the cells; ~1 beat, spatially bounded (D-157), then settles. |
| **Treble** | Rims **sparkle / grain** — fast, instantaneous, fast decay. |
| **Full slow cycle (~8–18 s)** | Palette **rotates** green→teal→violet→red; whole field slowly **roams/rotates**. Audio-independent — the emotional bed. |
| **Section change** (optional, tuning) | A slow arousal envelope may bias palette warmth + overall brightness. Secondary; faithful base is time-driven. |

## 3. Three-part bar (preset checklist Part 2)

1. **Iconic visual subject deliverable at fidelity — YES.** `mv_warp`/feedback is certified twice (Dragon Bloom, Fata Morgana). The signature look (§4: multi-layer radial-pulse zoom + luminance-gradient emboss rims + chromatic center-offset + domain-warped sine-cell noise) is standard fragment math — texture taps, dot, `sqrt`/`fract`/`sin`/`inversesqrt`, `max`, `mix` — all portable to MSL. **Lower** clipart risk than Dragon Bloom: no bilateral mirror (FA #48 doesn't apply).
2. **Clear musical role — YES** (§1), and inherited from the source rather than bolted on.
3. **Infrastructure-feasible — YES, one minor deferral.** The core look needs only the feedback texture (slot 0) + per-frame/comp math we can express. The **only** source op outside our contract is the warp-shader sharpen's **blur pyramid** (`sampler_blur1/2/3`) — Uzume exposes no general blur mips (only Fata Morgana has a bespoke 1/4-res blur target). The sharpen is secondary polish, not the signature; **defer it** — approximate with a manual 3-tap, or add a Fata-Morgana-style custom blur target only if a render proves it's needed. **No new engine passes required.**

## 4. Source mechanic (from `source_shaders.txt` — the port reference)

**baseVals:** `wave_mode 7`, near-invisible wave (`wave_a 0.001`, `wave_r/g/b 0`, but `modwavealphabyvolume 1`); slight zoom-in (`zoom 1.009`), minimal baseline `warp 0.00054`; **dense motion-vector field `mv_x 25.6 / mv_y 9.6`** (invisible, `mv_a 0`) — this advects the feedback into the drifting cell structure.

**Per-frame equations (the audio + time coupling):**
- **Palette rotation:** `wave_r=.85+.25*sin(.437*t+1)`, `wave_g`(.544), `wave_b`(.751) — three slow out-of-phase sines → the green→teal→violet→red drift.
- **Slow roam:** `rot/cx/cy/dx/dy += small * sin(low-freq * t)` — the field's slow wander/rotation.
- **Mid → zoom (PRIMARY continuous):** `rg = max(.77*rg, .02 + .5*min(2, 1.3*max(0, mid_att-1))); zoom += .1*rg`. Mid energy above unity raises an EMA-decay (`.77`) envelope that pumps zoom → cells inflate/breathe.
- **Bass → displacement kick (ACCENT):** a hysteresis threshold `bass_thresh` fires when `bass_att` crosses it (`above(...)`), latching `=2.13` and injecting `dx_residual=.016*sin(7t)`, `dy_residual=.012*sin(9t)` (and `wave_x/y -= 7*residual`); threshold relaxes `~.96*` per frame. A bounded, decaying lurch on bass onsets.
- Minor: `decay -= .01` every 6th frame (micro-flicker), `wave_mystery=.03*t`.

**Warp shader:** unsharp-mask **sharpen** (main − weighted blur-pyramid) → edge definition; **+ noise grain scaled by `treb_att`** (treble sparkle); slight desaturation. *(Blur pyramid = the deferred bit.)*

**Comp shader (the signature look):** **four radial-pulse layers** at `dist = 1 − fract(k/4 + t/18)` (k=0..3) → expanding rings every 18 s, quarter-phase offset; each weighted `inten = sqrt(dist)(1−dist)·4`. Layers alternate sample-center **(0.51,0.55)/(0.49,0.55)** → horizontal **chromatic offset** (the R/C/G rims). `dz` = **luminance Sobel gradient × inten** → **edge emboss** (the bright rims). `ret1 = max` of zoomed feedback across layers. Then a **domain-warped sine-cell field** (`sin(4·uv + dz + rand)` at 3 scales, `inversesqrt`) displaced **by the emboss gradient** → the veined cell micro-structure. Final: rand-weighted combine − slow color-roam (`slow_roam_sin·roam_cos`) + `ret*(1+ret)` contrast.

> Butterchurn uniforms with no direct Uzume equivalent — `rand_preset`/`rand_frame` (per-preset/per-frame randoms), `slow_roam_sin`/`roam_cos` (slow roam), `texsize_*`/`scale*`/`bias*` — get substituted with fixed seeds + `features.time`-driven roam + our texel sizes. Documented per-symbol at port time.

## 5. Port plan onto Uzume mv_warp

Pass mapping (3-pass `warp → compose → blit/swap`, per the substrate map):
- **Warp pass** (`nacre` per-vertex + decay): port `mv_x/y` advection as the per-vertex UV displacement (`mvWarpPerVertex`), `decay` from `mvWarpPerFrame`. The warp-shader sharpen/grain folds into the compose or a warp-stage fragment (grain = treble route).
- **Scene/compose pass** (`nacre_fragment`): this is where the **comp shader** lives — radial-pulse zoom + emboss rims + chromatic offset + sine-cell noise + the near-invisible additive waveform forming the **central core**. Reads feedback (slot 0), `FeatureVector` (0), `waveformData` (2), `StemFeatures` (3).
- **Blit pass:** display-stage comp (gamma; echo/invert off unless a render wants them).

Port order — **substrate + look first, audio second** (faithful character before reactivity, per FA #65):
1. Static port: get the cell-field + chromatic rims + palette rotation + slow roam rendering faithfully **at silence** (time-driven only). Side-by-side vs `(431)` at silence-equivalent.
2. Then layer the audio routes (§6) one at a time, auditing against the one-primitive-per-layer table.

## 6. Audio-routing table (one-primitive-per-layer — FA #67 audit)

| Visual layer | Audio primitive | Timescale | Source-eq origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cell-field zoom / inflation (breathing) | mid energy `f.midRel`/`f.midDev` (EMA memory) | continuous (~0.5 s) | `rg`/`q9` → `zoom` |
| Warp displacement-kick (field lurch/ripple) | bass `f.bassDev`, thresholded | bass-onset / event | `bass_thresh` → `dx/dy_residual` |
| Rim sparkle / micro-grain | treble `f.trebleDev` | fast | warp-shader noise × `treb_att` |
| Central luminous core brightness | waveform (buf 2) + total energy | continuous + per-sample | additive wave + radial-pulse convergence |
| Global palette hue rotation | **time** (faithful) [+ optional slow arousal nudge] | very slow (8–18 s) | `wave_r/g/b` sines; comp `t/18` |
| Slow field roam / rotation | **time** | very slow | `cx/cy/rot/dx/dy` sines |

No two visual layers share a primitive at the same timescale. ✓ (mids→volume/zoom and bass→position/kick are different layers *and* different timescales.)

## 7. Staged increments

| ID | Outcome | Done-when |
|---|---|---|
| **NACRE.1** | Design + reference curation. | ✅ committed `374791d`; uplifts greenlit by Matt. |
| **NACRE.2a** | Wire the custom-comp preset + a STUB look, test-reachable: `Nacre.{metal,json}` (stub `nacre_comp_fragment` + minimal scene + warp fns), `NacreState`, `feedbackFormat` + `VisualizerEngine` wiring, `NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest`. | App + engine build clean; accumulation test runs the live `warp→compose→blit` path ≥60 frames at silence without white-out; preset loads + renders non-black. **← current** |
| **NACRE.2b** | ✅ Port the FAITHFUL BASE (warp + comp + seed) onto a dedicated custom branch; uplifts deferred to NACRE.3+ (faithful-first, FA #65). | ✅ Custom `nacre_warp_fragment` (unsharp + 0.9 decay + grain + palette-tinted volume-gated core seed) + `nacre_comp_fragment` (radial-pulse emboss → chromatic-dispersion `inversesqrt` filaments + sine cells + slow roam) + `RenderPipeline+Nacre.swift` branch; `NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest` (non-black + no-white-out at silence over the live `renderNacre` path); contact frames read as the molten-iridescent (431) register on a dark ground with chromatic rims + luminous core. → Matt's live M7. |
| **NACRE.3** | Audio coupling (§6 routes, one at a time). | Each route's firing shown in a session-replay diagnostic (`features.csv`); one-primitive-per-layer audit holds; M7 round 1. |
| **NACRE.4** | Tuning to certification. | Matt's live M7 sign-off; `certified: true`; capability registry + plan updated. |

(NACRE.2 may split if the comp-shader port is large. Infrastructure and audio never bundled.)

## 8. Build pointers

- **Scaffold:** copy structure from `DragonBloom.metal` (`*_fragment`, `mvWarpPerFrame`, `mvWarpPerVertex`); no strand geometry (Nacre has no instanced geometry — it's pure feedback + fragment).
- **Sidecar:** mirror `DragonBloom.json`. Tentative: `family: "hypnotic"` (revisit "fluid" — affects orchestrator grouping; Dragon Bloom is also "hypnotic", so confirm Nacre shouldn't differ to avoid over-grouping two feedback presets), `passes: ["direct","mv_warp"]`, `decay ≈ 0.95`, `stem_affinity` minimal (Nacre is band-energy-driven more than stem-driven — likely `{}` or a light vocals→core link), `rubric_profile: "lightweight"`, `certified: false` until NACRE.4.
- **GPU contract:** direct-pass mv_warp fragment slots — buf 0 `FeatureVector`, buf 2 `waveformData`, buf 3 `StemFeatures`, tex 0 feedback, tex 4–11 noise. (`SceneUniforms` buf 4 is **not** bound in direct-pass — don't reach for it.)
- **Test harness:** adapt `DragonBloomMVWarpAccumulationTest` → `NacreMVWarpAccumulationTest`, env-gate `NACRE_MVWARP_DIAG=1`, silence vs music, gate on no-white-out + mid→zoom coupling + bass→displacement.
- **Visual harness:** `RENDER_VISUAL=1 swift test --package-path UzumeEngine --filter PresetVisualReview` → `/tmp/uzume_visual/<ISO>/` (silence/mid/beat). Required before first tuning commit.
- **Faithful oracle:** re-render `(431)` any time via `tools/milkdrop-render` (`royal_variants/$$$ Royal - Mashup (431).json` already extracted).

## 9. Risks / open decisions

- **Blur-pyramid sharpen** (deferred) — confirm by render whether manual-tap approximation suffices or a custom blur target is warranted (Fata Morgana precedent). Low risk (secondary polish).
- **`family` field** — "hypnotic" vs a new "fluid" grouping (orchestrator fatigue/transition impact of two hypnotic feedback presets). Product-adjacent; decide with Matt at NACRE.2.
- **Palette anchoring** — keep faithful time-driven rotation, or nudge toward album-art / arousal warmth? Faithful-first; arousal-nudge is a NACRE.3+ tuning lever, not a NACRE.2 requirement.
- **butterchurn-only uniforms** (`rand_preset`, `slow_roam`, etc.) — substitution table authored at NACRE.2; risk that fixed seeds flatten variety vs the original's per-load randomness (acceptable — a preset instance is deterministic anyway).

---

## 10. NACRE.2b — what landed (the faithful base)

**Architecture (the dedicated branch — the cleaner correction of 2a's convention path).** The
signature look needs a custom feedback warp reading per-frame uniforms + a fully-replacing comp; the
shared `encodeMVWarpPass` binds `chromatic@0`/`wetness@1` and no per-frame uniform to the warp
fragment, so overloading it would have risked the byte-identity guarantee. Instead Nacre gets its own
draw branch `RenderPipeline+Nacre.swift` (`drawWithNacre`/`renderNacre`: warp → comp → swap), mirroring
Fata Morgana, dispatched by a one-field `isNacre` discriminator on `MVWarpPipelineBundle`/`MVWarpState`
(checked before the FM blur heuristic). `NacreUniforms` (96 B) is computed CPU-side each frame (FM
pattern) and bound at fragment buffer(1) of both passes — so the 2a `NacreState` (the convention-path
comp buffer) was deleted (one mechanism, no dead code). Shared path stays byte-identical
(PresetRegression + DB/FM accumulation green).

**Corrected source facts (verify-the-decode, FA #73):**
- **`mv_x 25.6 / mv_y 9.6` with `mv_a 0` does NOT advect.** Those are the count of Milkdrop's HIDDEN
  motion-vector debug-grid overlay (`mv_a` is its opacity); with `mv_a 0` they're invisible and have
  no effect on the warp. The plan §4 "dense motion-vector field advects the feedback into the drifting
  cell structure" was a misread. The drift is zoom (1.009) + the slow `rot/cx/cy/dx/dy` roam sines only.
- **The waveform seed is volume-gated** (`modwavealphabyvolume`): faint at silence, bright with audio.
  Ported as a palette-tinted central core gated by overall energy (`coreEnergy`) — which is also the
  faithful "core brightness ← volume" musical route. A *constant* bright core flooded the frame to
  opaque warm metal over ~16 s (anti-reference); gating fixes it AND keeps the silence ground dark.
- **Bass kick via `bassDev`, not the source's `bass_thresh` absolute-threshold hysteresis** — driving
  motion from an absolute threshold on AGC-normalized energy is FA #31; `bassDev` is the Uzume-
  correct onset primitive and gives the same bounded decaying lurch.

**Faithful-port tuning learnings (feedback-preset craft):**
- **Cell scale is governed by the unsharp blur WIDTH, not the comp's sine frequency.** The comp's
  `sin(4·uv + dz)` already makes big cells when `dz` (the feedback's luminance gradient) is SMOOTH. A
  narrow unsharp blur (or strong/high-freq grain) makes the feedback high-frequency → `dz` shatters the
  cells into an oil-slick fleck crinkle. Wide blur + low-frequency smooth value-noise grain → big glassy
  membranes. (This is why the source uses a wide 3-level blur pyramid; a single wide inline gaussian
  stands in — the pyramid is deferred, NACRE_PLAN §9 / kickoff §5.)
- **Unclamped HDR feedback blooms to white.** The source stores feedback to 8-bit UNORM (clamps each
  frame); the unsharp + rectified grain grow unbounded on a float buffer. Clamping the warp output to
  `[0,1]` replicates the source's bound (the kickoff's "fall back if it over-blooms"). The `.rgba16Float`
  buffer is retained for the NACRE.3 iridescence uplift's headroom but today carries `[0,1]`.
- **The dark ground needs the FM sRGB-decode at the comp→drawable write.** Without it, the sRGB drawable
  encode lifts the near-black ground to a pale grey midtone (D-139's "deeper black needed").

**Deferred (the 3 greenlit uplifts — AFTER M7 confirms the base, FA #65):** stem-instrument routing,
real thin-film iridescence on HDR (re-unclamp the feedback), smooth-Voronoi cells. NACRE.3 = the audio
routes (§6) one at a time; NACRE.4 = cert. The streaky-flow vs glassy-bubble balance, the exact cell
scale/crispness, and `randPreset`/grain constants are live-M7 tuning levers — not over-tuned headless
against the static stills (the live butterchurn oracle, kickoff §3, is the per-frame gate Matt runs).

## 11. NACRE.3 — what landed (audio coupling), and the brightness dead-end

M7-driven with Matt over ~9 commits (`f95038b`→`a5a2e68`, 2026-06-26). The base was confirmed live; this
increment was about making it move with the music.

**Routes that LANDED:**
- **hue ← harmony** — the spectral centroid's deviation from a slow section-norm nudges the palette PHASE
  (bounded ±1.5 s ≈ ±10 % of the ~14 s cycle). Track-robust (deviation, not absolute), heavily smoothed.
- **turning ← energy** — a continuous warp rotation `nu.spin` (rad/frame) whose rate ← a smoothed
  avg-stem-energy envelope (floor 0.18, gain 0.012). The molten field swirls faster as the music fills
  out (~2 °/s sparse → ~15–20 °/s at the climax). Applied in `nacre_warp_fragment` (rotate the re-sampled
  `prev` about centre) so it ACCUMULATES into a continuous swirl. Smooth envelope, not transients → reads
  as intensity, not jerk. Uses **avg-stem-energy** because the band average is BLIND to full-band entries
  (it reads ~0.14 at a full-band crash — the energy is in the stems).
- The warp **core seed** stays STEADY total-energy; base motion routes (zoom ← mid, sway ← bass, grain ←
  treble) all `tanh`-soft-saturated + attack-smoothed (the deviation-range lesson: real signals spike ~3×).

**Tried and REMOVED — both were brightness-medium, and brightness is the wrong medium for this preset:**
- **downbeat brightness pulse** (bar-locked `ret *= 1+barPulse`): timing landed ("pulse is accurate") but
  "a little too bright" → stem-fullness rolloff at full-band → "still bothersome". 
- **core ← voice display glow** (`0.60·tanh(vocals)` central add): "blindingly bright at some points" — a
  session brightness-driver trace showed it added **+0.46 at centre on the vocal peaks** (vocals spike to
  1.56), saturating the already-bright field. Removing it fixed the brightness (Matt confirmed live).

**The load-bearing lessons (also in CLAUDE.md memory / [[nacre-preset]]):**
1. **Brightness is the wrong connection medium for a bright/molten feedback field.** Any luminance bump
   reads as a flash no matter how it's tuned — a DEAD END for this preset class. Use motion.
2. **The connection axis is transient-vs-envelope, not motion-vs-colour.** Per-beat transient motion is
   the "jerk"; smooth *envelope* motion (turning ← slow energy) is what reads as connected without jerk.
3. **Audit autonomous-but-uncoupled motion early.** Nacre's `rot`/`cx`/`cy` roam were pure time-sines —
   the most expressive levers sat untapped while brightness carried (badly) the whole connection.

Diagnostic note: the brightness was diagnosed from the session CSV (driver trace), not a render harness
— `loadSessionRich` was scoped then deferred (YAGNI: the CSV trace sufficed). Stand it up only if a
future brightness/colour defect can't be read from the CSV.

## 12. NACRE.4 — the connection lands + CERTIFIED (2026-06-26)

The turning read weakly (a featureless field has nothing to clock rotation against). The M7 history had
pinned the gap exactly: the **downbeat rhythm DID read** ("the pulse is accurate") — brightness was just
the wrong medium (flash) and whole-field rotation the wrong medium (invisible). The untried intersection
— *the detectable rhythm in a visible-motion medium* — is the answer: a **display-stage downbeat camera
push** (`nu.barPush`, a sharp-attack/bar-decay envelope on `barPhase01`, contracts the comp's view coords
→ the whole field magnifies ~5 % on the downbeat, settling over the bar). Display-stage → no smear; the
field visibly *surges with the beat*. Matt M7: "looking good… comfortable with certifying."

**Certification is not the flag flip — the flip makes the cert gates ENFORCE.** Registering Nacre:
- `Nacre.json certified: true`.
- `FidelityRubricTests.certifiedPresets` += Nacre — automated rubric: L1 silence-fallback, L2 deviation-
  primitives, L3 performance all pass; **L4 reference frame-match is the manual item, satisfied by Matt's
  live M7** (SHADER_CRAFT §12.1 — Matt's M7 is the load-bearing gate).
- `PhotosensitivityCertificationTests.multiPassMeasured` += Nacre — **feedback presets are flash-measured
  by the MULTI-PASS harness**, not the single-pass FeatureVector gate (which fails loud if a certified
  preset renders static there → that was the first apparent "failure," meaning "join the multi-pass set").
- A real `renderNacre` flash test in `MultiPassFlashHarnessTests` (+ `configureMVWarp` Nacre wiring:
  `.rgba16Float` feedback, `isNacre` branch). The worst-case beat train drives `barPhase01`, so the push
  FIRES and is measured: **peak 0.00 flashes/s, Δluma 0.090, SAFE** (limit 3.0) — the magnify doesn't
  strobe. All cert gates green (34 tests / 5 suites); app 388; lint 0.

**Follow-ups surfaced (separate, NOT NACRE.4):** `PresetDescriptorRubricFieldsTests`' certified +
lightweight allowlists are stale for several presets (Nimbus/Skein/Aurora Veil/Dragon Bloom/Fata Morgana/
Staged Sandbox) and the test only passes because it skips when the Shaders bundle isn't accessible — a
cert guard that doesn't run (**STILL OPEN**, flagged to Matt).

The sidecar `description` + `stem_affinity` were corrected in **NACRE.5** (2026-06-26): the description now
states the shipped energy/beat/harmony coupling (the deferred thin-film / smooth-Voronoi / per-stem-routing
claims removed), and `stem_affinity` is **empty** — Nacre is **stem-agnostic** (Matt's call: the planner
matches it on mood/energy/section, not a fictional per-stem routing; the scorer reads only affinity *keys*,
so an empty dict scores neutral 0.5). §1's musical-role is left verbatim as original *design intent* —
§10–12 are the as-built reconciliation, and the plan is not retconned.

## 13. TONAL.3 — hue ← REAL harmony (D-178), ⏳ pending live M7 (2026-07-10)

The NACRE.3 "hue ← harmony" was honestly the **spectral-centroid deviation** — a brightness/timbre proxy, not harmony (§11; the sidecar said so after NACRE.5). TONAL.1 shipped the real signal: the **Tonal Interval Vector** fifths phase (`tonal_phase_fifths`, D-178). TONAL.3 swaps Nacre's hue channel to it.

**Musical role (updated):** *when the song modulates to a related key, the palette drifts to a related colour on the circle of fifths; on a vamp it holds; the same song transposed lands on shifted-but-related colours* — the palette travels with the harmony, not the energy.

**What landed (`RenderPipeline+Nacre.swift` + `Nacre.metal`):**
- **Hue** — `uni.hueShift` now maps the fifths phase to the full ~14.4 s `nacrePalette` cycle (`2π/0.437`; the 12 keys span the wheel, fifth-adjacent keys → adjacent colours). The phase is circular-EMA'd as a **unit vector** (`nacreFifthsVec`, ~0.8 s) so modulations glide, wrap-safe across ±π (a scalar EMA sweeps the long way). Consonance-gated → silence / percussion / noise falls back to the faithful time rotation (D-019). Never strobes (the anti-reference) — it is a slow harmonic signal.
- **Saturation** — `nu.tonal.x`, consonance-gated: atonal MUSIC desaturates toward the neutral rest state (gentle 0.38 vs the faithful 0.20; mud-safe), but **energy-aware** so SILENCE keeps the faithful colourful warmup (the gate would otherwise wash out the D-019 state — a caught regression).
- **Tension → rim dispersion: DEFERRED to round 2.** It under-develops on 30 s preview clips (love_rehab fixture tension is flat [0, 0.0003]) so the QG.1 route-coverage gate can't exercise it — a fixture-breadth limit, not a dead route. Keeps FA #67 clean with two routes. `nu.tonal.y` reserved.

**Evidence:** `NACRE_FIFTHS`-injected diag frames show the palette shift **gold-green → teal-green** across a key change (shifted-but-related, not a jump); D-181 verdict table PASS on all mandatory traits + anti-refs (esp. no hue-strobing); flash re-measured **0.50 flashes/s SAFE**; `RouteCoverageTests` green (`hue_from_harmony`→`tonalPhaseFifths`, `saturation_from_consonance`→`tonalConsonance` both fire on all 3 fixtures); sidecar `description` + `audio_routes` updated (NACRE.5 honesty). Saturation's isolated visual effect is confounded by feedback chaos in a still — an M7 watch-item.

**Round 1 M7 (session `2026-07-10T15-00-03Z`): "not sure if it worked."** The data proved the pipeline was healthy — tap alive (bass mean 0.19, ~197 s), `tonal_phase_fifths` swept the full ±π range (10 621 distinct), `tonal_consonance` mean 0.107 (well above the 0.05 gate). So the coupling was **active with good signal** — but **invisible**. Root cause (quantitative): round 1 was `palette = time + harmonyOffset`; over 197 s the CLOCK advanced **~13.7 full palette cycles** while the harmony offset spans only **±0.5 cycle** — time dominated harmony ~27:1, so the palette rotated through every colour on the clock regardless of the key, and never held on a vamp. An additive nudge on a full time rotation cannot read.

**Round 2 (2026-07-10): harmony SETS the position, the clock is demoted.** `nu.hueShift` now carries the FULL palette phase, computed CPU-side: `harmonyAnchor·gate + driftAccumulator`, where the drift rate is the faithful ~14.4 s cycle at silence/atonal (rate 1.0) and nearly stops when tonal (0.06 ≈ 240 s) — a continuous accumulator so the rate change never snaps. The key you're in IS the colour; on a vamp the hue **holds** (the palette's motion then comes from the harmony moving through the song's chords), on a modulation it **moves**, at silence it restores the faithful full rotation. Shader: the palette seed reads `nacrePalette(nu.hueShift)` (not `nu.time + hueShift`); `nu.time` still drives grain + radial pulse. **Evidence:** dev-preview frames now show a *legible* separation — key A gold-green vs key B green-teal at the same time (harmony sets position), and the same key **holds** its colour across 4× the elapsed time (clock demoted); flash re-measured 0.50 flashes/s SAFE; routes unchanged (still green). **Matt re-M7 (2026-07-10): "looks good" — SIGNED OFF.** Nacre keeps its certification with the real harmony-hue coupling; the round-1 "additive nudge on a full rotation is invisible" lesson is the durable finding. Parked round-3 levers (only if wanted): the tension→rim-dispersion secondary (fixture-breadth blocks the gate today) and widening the hue mapping if the ~30°/fifth travel ever reads too subtle.

## 14. NACRE.7 — the hue stops jumping on an unclear key (BUG-179), ⏳ pending live M7 (2026-10-01)

The TONAL.3 hue took `atan2` of the ~0.8 s circular fifths mean. Just above the consonance gate the fifths phase is near-random, the mean collapses (|v| ~ 0.005) and its angle swung up to 0.38 turns in one frame (love_rehab). **Rule for any hue ← fifths route: an averaged direction is a key only when its length says so.** `NacreHueState` gates the key by |v| (0.15 → 0.4) and slews the palette at 0.25 turns/s along the shortest arc. Understory (UND.5) carries the same fix. A held clear key lands within ~5° of the TONAL.3 colour; hazy-key passages fall back to the atonal rest state.
